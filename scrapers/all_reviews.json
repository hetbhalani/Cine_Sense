There are, of course, large portions of the book missing, which unfortunately makes the motives of the perpetrators seem weak. Some of the casting just didn't work at all, accents all over the place. If there had been more time to do the book justice, and more thought put into the casting, this could have been a standout series. As it is it's a mediocre film. Disappointed.",

Celia Imrie is a brilliant casting for Joyce (as were nearly all the main characters - jury is still out on Pierce Brosnan as Ron), but it all felt a bit lost in translation to screen. The character of Bogdan was far away from the man written in the books, as was Donna.

The list could go on.People who found this \"too light\" clearly don't share my sense of humour. In my view, it's the lightness and quirky characters' playful approach to a rather dark theme that makes the Thursday Murder Club so brilliant. They capture the spirit of the book quite nicely for a movie adaptation!Having read all books so far, I know I will watch this movie again - and look forwards for more to come!",

The question I'd had ever since I heard this first novel would be adapted-\"But can they really fit all that action into two hours? Because cutting out anything would chip away at the magic...\"-was still buzzing in my head, though more faintly now, sulking in a corner.But slowly, as the story speeds up and large chunks of the plot vanish, and even a character is completely changed for the worse (leaving me wondering: how will the next adaptations look without him?), that buzzing returns triumphantly. The ending leaves a sensation similar to the one where the ground is ripped out from under your feet, leaving you breathless for a moment and with the question: was that all?This tale deserved to be told as a faithful miniseries; as a film, it feels like a missed opportunity, despite a cast that truly deserved.",

            "review": "This is one of those movies that many of us who enjoyed the books had been looking forward to. Of course, no adaptation can ever be 100% faithful to its source material, but this one feels especially uneven. The first part of the film drags, weighed down with clunky \"Netflix-style\" exposition. What made the novel so charming-the eccentric details, the quirks and foibles, back stories, and the very British sense of humor-has largely been flattened out. It should have felt like the Famous Five all grown up, retired, and solving murders. Instead, we get a cast of very talented, well-known actors working with a limp script that strips away everything that was unique about the book.There are no standout performances as the script doesn't dwell on any character development , but the real problem here lies with Chris Columbus. The film lacks both direction and any real understanding of, or sympathy for, the novel and what made it so successful. Sadly, it feels like another case of Netflix snapping up the rights and running the story through an algorithm to produce the blandest version possible. Perhaps it would have worked better as a series. Perhaps, for those who love the books, it's best to let the characters remain on the page.The film plays more like an overproduced episode of Midsomer Murders. At times, it even reminded me of The Boys in Blue with Cannon and Ball-though if you haven't seen that, consider yourself lucky.Aside from the directorial tone, the script has serious problems. The ending feels rushed, and the shifts in pacing from the novel make it anticlimactic. Worse still, the writing often undercuts itself. At one moment, the film invites us to appreciate that age is no barrier to knowledge, but in the next it asks us to laugh at \"old phones\" and the characters' supposed confusion with technology. A painfully unfunny gag about a PDF file is followed just minutes later by Elizabeth effortlessly collating and printing photos from multiple smartphones.It's a feeble mess, which is a shame, because the novel-while cozy and a little corny-also carried a real undercurrent of darkness and menace. Here, that edge is completely absent. Columbus directs it as though he borrowed drones from Downton Abbey and the twee set design of The Vicar of Dibley.The result is the kind of movie you make when you don't trust your audience to follow a plot, or to understand England well enough to appreciate a more authentic setting and cultural nuance.A real missed opportunity for what could have been a cracking film. No wonder Netflix burried it at the end of August and didn't give it a theatrical wide release.",

Four class actors, three of whom seemed perfectlty cast for the parts in the book (only Brosnan seems like a bit of an odd choice, but not distastrous). However, in all four cases, the delivery of the lines is unbelieveably wooden. Within a few minutes I began to realise that the whole audio track sounded like a bad radio play - where the characters are reading their lines, almost unseen, into a microphone. Then I noticed that there are no gaps between dialog of longer than a few seconds, and even those are filled with some kind of audio-signalling of the context. I wonder: was this actually recorded first as an audio-book or radio production, to which the actors then had to lip-synch? It's the only explanation I can come up with for such wooden delivery. I enjoyed the books; but this film makes you realise that without the subtleties of the characterisations in the book (Joyce was a great literary invention) - which the film eliminates - all the rest is just plot, and that was never the books strong suit.",

            "review": "Greetings again from the darkness. This is the type of movie that almost begs to be criticized, while at the same time, deserves to be enjoyed for being exactly what it tries to be. Author Richard Osman now has five books in this series, and the first has been adapted by co-writers Katy Brand (GOOD LUCK TO YOU, LEO GRANDE, 2022) and Suzanne Heathcote (\"Fear the Walking Dead\"). It's directed by Chris Columbus, known for HOME ALONE (1990), MRS DOUBTFIRE (1993) and a couple of the Harry Potter movies. These are professionals who know how to entertain ... and just as importantly, they know how to cast.Take two Oscar winners, a former James Bond, a few British acting stalwarts, and add in a stunning English countryside manor and a murder mystery, and the result is low-key, crowd-pleasing entertainment (even if it panders a bit to its target audience). The setting is Cooper Chase, a scrumptious estate serving as a much-desired retirement home. Hobbies among the residents include the expected crafts, archery, crosswords, sudoku, jigsaw puzzling, and various committees. The most unusual is the Thursday Murder Club, where Elizabeth (Oscar winner Dame Helen Mirren), Ron (former 007 Pierce Brosnan), and Ibrahim (Oscar winner Sir Ben Kingsley) meet up to discuss an open police case provided by Elizabeth's now comatose ex-cop friend.It doesn't take long for new resident Joyce (Celia Imrie, THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL, 2011) to be accepted into the club, where her nursing experience perfectly complements the diverse skills of former union leader Ron, former psychiatrist Ibrahim, and the mysteriously clever Elizabeth (whose background takes a while to come to light). Greedy owner Ian Ventham (David Tennant) wants to transition the home into luxury condos, and this irritates the residents while putting a spotlight on the other two owners, Tony Curran (Geoff Bell) and Bobby Tanner (Richard E Grant).When the murder occurs, the TMC springs into action with a \"real\" case. If they can solve it, they may even save Cooper Chase for all residents. The story unfolds in the manner of most whodunits, and our attention is on the main characters as well as others who come into play: Stephen (Jonathan Pryce) is Elizabeth's dementia-stricken husband, DCI Chris Hudson (Daniel Mays) doesn't appreciate the talents of TMC, while his assistant, Officer Donna de Freitas (Naomie Ackie) certainly does.The clues, the research, and the disclosure of mastermind Elizabeth's past are all fun to watch, and Joyce's obsession with baking fancy cakes provides a necessary distraction at times. Fifteen-time Oscar nominee Thomas Newman provides the score, and we also get a bit of T Rex (\"Bang a Gong\"), a Springsteen 'The River' t-shirt, and a finale featuring an on-the-nose Cat Stevens' \"Oh Very Young\". One blink and you'll miss it one-liner occurs when Stephen tells his wife, \"You look like the Queen\". Gray cinema murder mystery is definitely having a moment thanks to \"Only Murders in the Building\", the \"Matlock\" reboot, and the recently announced reboot of \"Murder She Wrote.\" It's interesting to note that Helen Mirren, Pierce Brosnan, and Geoff Bell were all key players in the recent \"MobLand\", a much darker limited series. I'm sure Dame Helen Mirren is enjoying the resurgence ... just don't call her \"feisty\".Opens on Netflix beginning August 28, 2025.",

Practical effects shine, the score adds weight to the tension, and there are even moments of levity that break up the intensity without ever killing the mood.What makes Weapons stand out is how confidently it holds your attention. From start to finish, it's a film that refuses to let go, pulling you deeper into its unsettling premise. It's refreshing to see such commitment to originality in mainstream horror, and the movie feels like a love letter to the genre's willingness to take risks.

The storyline follows a town in shock after an entire elementary school class mysteriously vanishes one night, after all the children suddenly run out of their homes. The blame falls on the teacher, who becomes desperate to clear her name-but she has no idea where to begin. Maybe she should start with the one student who didn't go missing...This picture is written and directed by Zach Cregger (Barbarian) and stars Julia Garner (Ozark), Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men), Amy Madigan (Streets of Fire), Benedict Wong (Doctor Strange), and Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers).Weapons is a unique and gripping addition to the horror genre, evoking the tone of both Hereditary and The Children. The acting is phenomenal-every cast member delivers a grounded, emotionally authentic performance. The story unfolds in a Pulp Fiction-style structure, allowing the audience to piece everything together from different characters' perspectives.The horror builds slowly and methodically, but once it kicks in, it really kicks in. The gore is intense, and a few scenes even brought Drag Me to Hell to mind. The villain is top-tier, and the central concept is executed with precision. Standout moments-especially the kitchen and gas station scenes-are packed with tension and shot beautifully. The camerawork throughout is exceptional, particularly in the climax, and even everyday settings like the liquor store are filmed with eerie familiarity. There's a cloud of mystery hanging over the film, and as the pieces finally click into place, the ending lands perfectly.In conclusion, Weapons is everything you want it to be-methodical, well-written, and even better executed.

            "review": "\"Weapons\" focuses on a Pennsylvania town where a large group of children-coincidentally (or perhaps not) from the same home classroom-flee their homes one night and disappear. Suspicion naturally falls on their teacher, but an intricate web of events unfolds, showcasing a dark, if not unbelievable, turn of events.While writer-director Zach Cregger's \"Barbarian\" attracted a significant following among genre fans, I was not particularly a fan of that film; while I thought it had its share of strong elements and could see why some people loved it, the tone and genre-bending grotesque humor did not appeal to my taste. Because of this, I had tempered expectations for this film, but on the whole was pleasantly surprised. There is certainly dark humor here, but it is played in a more human way.The screenplay utilizes segmented vignettes that interlock, forming a larger portrait of the strange, almost Stephen King-esque events unfolding in the small community. Tensions abound, as the missing kids' schoolteacher, Justine Gandy (Julia Garner) receives her scarlet letter, with grief-stricken parents such as Archer (Josh Brolin) blaming her for their children's disappearances. Further characters are thrown into the mix and each have their own narrative strands in the chain of events, including a struggling cop (Alden Ehrenreich), a young drug addict and petty thief (Austin Abrams), and the school principal Andrew (Benedict Wong).While this narrative mode can often be hit-or-miss, it is played to great effect here and is clever without being too gimmicky or pretentious for its own good. On a purely technical level, the film is solid-the cinematography and locations are atmospheric, the sparse use of music and silence is pointed, and the performances are uniformly good from everyone involved. That being said, Amy Madigan, playing the aunt of the sole child in his class who didn't vanish into the night, steals the thunder from everyone , giving a performance that is of \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\" proportions.Many have noted that the less you know about the film going into it, the better, and while I think that adage stands true for most moviegoing experiences, it is especially true here. The interlocking character vignettes are compelling in their own right, and the plot strands playfully connect by degrees, keeping the audience firmly planted on their toes. The truth eludes you until the outrageous final act, which is where I think the film could lose some people; however, by that point, I think even most hardened horror fans will remain invested due to the high level of intrigue that has brewed over the previous hour and a half. \"Where could this possibly go?\" was a recurring thought as I watched this, and even when it stretched credulity as the answers came, I remained firmly in the crosshairs, just as each of the children in Ms. Gandy's ill-fated homeroom. 8/10.",

            "review": "I WAS SO EXCITED FOR THIS! From the first ever teaser trailer to the MARKETING like wow I was hooked! Watching it this night in IMAX was kinda disappointing read on down.Story: At 2:17 alot of kids just run out of their house. That was all I needed to go in on and the movie delivers the mystery and intrigue very well. Once they set up the mystery you do feel like your taken on the journey of discovery. The ONLY ISSUE is horror buffs will IMMEDIATELY catch on to what's going on. Once I kinda already knew what was happening it kinda takes you out because you as the audience knows but the characters do not. Alot of pretty convenient opportunities happen in this movie as well that kinda made me raise a eye.Horror: In my opinion they really should have committed to the scares BUT THEY DON'T. The comedy SHOULD have been REMOVED like TAKEN OUT COMPLETELY! Some genuine scares are COMPLETELY DEMOLISHED by the director wanting you to laugh. In the opening shot you get like punk rock music WHEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A CREEPY AMBIENCE!Story: Multiple perspectives are shown in this movie and some are used to amazing effect. It's was creative for the first hour but again once you the audience member finds out what the threat is your kinda just watching it unfold waiting for the characters to catch up.Overall I didn't hate the film and I enjoyed it so much more then barbarians but that wasn't ever a high bar to me. THE MARKETING OVERSOLD THE SCARES and they turned the scariest moments into comedy. I couldn't shake the feeling those who wait for streaming will Definitely enjoy it alot more in their houses. Losing those scares kinda makes it your preference if you pay to see it on the big screen or not.",

Not just the episodic nature that made me have callbacks ... but how the characters are written. They all have their issues, they all feel real.And they all have mostly best interest at heart. Since we are human and flawed. That is obviously not always the case. Be it the cop friend, be it the teacher with her own issues. Even if you mean well ... it can feel and be mean to others.The vibe and the general feeling about this was good ... and the movie exceeded those expectations. Was lucky enough to catch it at a (surprise) preview - so we didn't know what to expect.But going into this thinking about horror movies ... it sort of defies the rules that have been set. It is unwritten law that (most) horror movies start with a really scary scene ... that is supposed to get the viewers hooked. Well the introduction here is quite ... well underplayed. It is what we know from the trailers ... kids go missing - actually a whole class ... well not quite, but you'll see and understand.We start with the teacher and her point of view and then switch to other characters - her segment ending with ... well you may not grasp entirely what is being done there ... but it will become evident .. I am not cutting to the chase am I? But you'll understand .. by the time the last segment starts I had figured out what was happening ... and that is not a bad thing.Even if I knew where it was leading and what the reason of the disappearance was before it was actually revealed on screen ... it is so well told and acted ... the sound design doing its best to enhance that feeling too ... bring them back? Can it be done? Well you'll have to watch to see ... and now ... bring her back .. the other most anticipated horror movie of the year .... coming out ... soon.",

It's the kind of movie that feels fresh and unlike anything you've seen before, which is a significant achievement in itself.The film's strength lies in its innovative approach to the genre, with a directorial style that feels distinct and intentional. The planning and execution of its key moments are handled with a precision that speaks to a clear and confident vision. This is what makes \"Weapons\" so good and memorable for its core strengths.However, the film is not without its flaws, which prevent it from achieving absolute perfection. The pacing, at times, can be quite slow, with some scenes feeling unnecessary and acting as fillers that detract from the overall narrative momentum. This unevenness can be tiring and makes it a challenge for the viewer to stay consistently engaged.A particular point of weakness is the film's antagonist. While the central conflict is well-executed, the villain lacks a clear purpose or compelling motivation, making their role feel less impactful than it should. This absence of a strong, purposeful antagonist diminishes some of the film's dramatic weight.Despite these issues with pacing and the villain, \"Weapons\" is a highly ambitious and well-made film. Its originality and confident direction make it a worthwhile watch and an impressive cinematic effort.",

            "review": "Thunderbolts* is unlike anything we've seen before in a superhero blockbuster. Its bold focus on mental health is the beating heart of the film, shaping the story in a way that's refreshingly original. We've had plenty of superhero (and anti-hero) movies, but none have tackled mental health as deeply or as honestly as this. This is as fresh as it gets, and the film hits its message squarely on the mark. Could that message have been louder or more powerful? Absolutely. But is it enough for audiences to understand, feel, and reflect on? Without a doubt. It's a gem that invites viewers to empathize, to look inward, and to recognize the struggles of those around them. In many ways, Thunderbolts feels like a superhero in its own right, delivering a powerful PSA that's woven seamlessly into the narrative rather than feeling tacked on.We're in love with the concept here; an anti-hero film built around mental health. It makes the story and the character arcs far deeper and more meaningful than they'd be if these were just your typical caped crusaders. Thunderbolts* is the MCU's rawest exploration of mental health to date. We've heard the words \"trauma\" and \"healing\" tossed around in superhero flicks before like WandaVision, but this is different. This film doesn't just mention the weight of mental health, it lives in it. Yelena's story, in particular, has been carefully nurtured since Phase 4, and the decision to continue her journey down this road is nothing short of brilliant. Yelena, like Black Widow before her, isn't a superhero with powers. She's human. She's flawed, resilient, and painfully relatable and that makes her journey hit even harder.We actually like the character dynamics between the anti-heroes. We like that every of their personality shines. Their dynamics push the film's mental health themes even further. These might have been the underdogs of previous movies, characters we barely remembered but here, they get their moment. And wow, do they deliver. Each one gets time to prove they're so much more than sidekicks or forgotten faces and by the end, you can't help but root for them.What's especially moving is how much these characters matter both to themselves and to each other. They've all been torn down, denigrated, beaten back, and made to feel like the world is against them. They're loners by nature, forced into the uncomfortable space of working as a team for the first time. Watching them navigate that, to lean on each other when things fall apart, is both heartwarming and powerful. It's a clear reminder of the importance of friendship, of admitting when you need help, and of realizing that none of us can do it all alone.The action sequences in this are great. It's a blast watching everyone throw down and show off their skills. But here's the thing, while the action is awesome, it's not what makes this film great. This movie proves that a superhero film doesn't need to lean on endless explosions to leave an impact. The story itself is raw, human, and beautifully told and that is more than enough. That's why Thunderbolts* stands tall in the post-Endgame era. The action is tight, but the storytelling is what really puts it over the top.And guess what? They didn't rely on cameos. We could safely say that Deadpool vs Wolverine, Spider-Man: No Way Home and Thunderbolts* are the top 3 films after Avengers Endgame but what Thunderbolts* sets apart from the other two is it's the only one that doesn't rely on cameos. It doesn't need nostalgic bait, it doesn't need 'help' from anyone, it's just them trying to save the day and trying to figure out how to solve the problems they are in. And we love them for it.Florence Pugh, as always, is a knockout. She's never missed a beat, and once again, she's phenomenal here. Her accent might not be perfect, but who cares? She's a powerhouse, carrying the weight of a character struggling with identity and searching for meaning. She's the voice of so many who feel lost or stuck, and Pugh brings that to life with so much heart. She's a beacon of hope, a reminder that even when it feels impossible, there's light at the end of the tunnel. The rest of the cast? Stellar too. Lewis Pullman deserves a special shoutout. He proves here that he's a force to be reckoned with. Forget the early skepticism about his casting. He owns it completely, and Hollywood seriously needs to give this guy more credit.And yes, Malaysia plays a huge role in this film and the Menara Merdeka 118 shot is breathtaking. Instead of the usual sunny, warm tones we often see, the film opts for a moodier palette blue, dark, and cloudy which beautifully matches the film's somber, reflective theme. It just fits.The third act really dives deep into the mental health themes, in a way that feels raw and personal. The true villain here isn't a monster or alien, it's the demons we all battle inside. It emphasizes this theme in a way that feels plausible, personable and relatable. A villain that lives within all of us. A villain that everyone of us has battled against in some way and some parts in our lives. How much you connect with the film might depend on how you view your life and how much experience you've dealt with but one thing's for sure, it'll leave you thinking long after the credits roll.Was anything wasted in this film? There is one. One character didn't get nearly the spotlight they deserved. Everyone else got their moment to shine except for one and that felt like a missed opportunity.As for the comedy, it's hit and miss. Some of it lands really well. The belly-laugh kind of good while other moments fall flat or feel a bit forced. Some jokes could've used a little more setup, and a few felt repetitive, but overall, there's enough good humor sprinkled in.We did feel like the third act could have fleshed out more. It could have used more breathing room. It moves fast, too fast at times and some moments feel rushed or a bit disjointed. If they'd let things simmer just a bit longer, it could have been even more impactful.And yes, Thunderbolts* has 2 credits scene. The first one is simply light and funny which is bearable enough but the second one will hype everyone up for what's to come. Not that it's important to reveal it at the end credits but with audience losing hope for the future of MCU, this will get everyone back on their feet, cheering and hoping that Phase 6 will be the same with what Phase 3 had to offer...or at least almost.Verdict: Thunderbolts* is the anti-hero film we didn't know we needed. It delivers a story rooted in something we all face: mental health. This is raw. It's personal. And it feels relatable and real. It explores themes of isolation, trauma, and the power of asking for help, making it one of the MCU's most personal stories yet. It ditches the nostalgia bait and focuses on characters wrestling with their own demons, making their journeys relatable and impactful. The action is tight, but it's the emotional weight that truly lands (Yes, we did cry a bit). Florence Pugh leads with power and vulnerability, backed by a stellar cast and the famous Malaysia's Menara Merdeka 118 isn't just cinematic, it symbolizes the towering weight these characters carry. Thank you, Marvel.",

            "review": "\"Thunderbolts\" it's some of Marvel's darkest material to date, dealing with the emotional wreckage of broken individuals grappling with their past choices and finding camaraderie amidst the emptiness of their lives. This may be a team-up movie, but it very much belongs to Florence Pugh, who carries much of the dramatic weight of the movie on her back, while Lewis Pullman delivers a complex performance as a sympathetic character at war with himself. The imperfections somehow all feel fitting for this anti-hero team of misfits. Putting emphasis on the character work and practical action makes this feel like the old Marvel that has us for a decade plus. Wish we'd gotten this sooner.\"Thunderbolts*\" it's a bold dive into trauma, healing, and redemption. Proof that even the so-called defective losers and disposable delinquents can rise above their past and become the heroes no one expected. It's gritty, emotional and unlike anything Marvel has done before - a must-see story that hits where it hurts and heals where it matters.I can tell that the movie is one of Marvel's most enjoyable films in a while. It feels different than most of the studio's projects. Its bold, funny, filled with great action and an unexpected emotional punch. It has the rewatchable factor for sure. Has so much spark, charisma, and tells a genuinely emotional story you connect with.It is truly fantastic, the cast has electric chemistry with each other (Florence Pugh & Lewis Pullman are the standouts) and the action sequences are very strong. But most of all, the movie's story is bold, important & so well-written. Florence Pugh brings the heart, David Harbour is consistently funny, & Lewis Pullman might be the stealth MVP.This is probably one of he most if not the most humane movie filled with allowing their anti hero being flawed, broken and regretful. Sebastian Stan has an absolute scene stealing moment, yet Florence Pugh shows she is the true lead of the new generation and team. She is the star, that shines the brightest. There's a lot to love in this movie honestly.A visually daring, emotionally resonant superhero movie that pushes mental health to the forefront. The MCU future is bright. Definitely stick around after the credits, there are 2 scenes and the last one will make you so hyped!",

            "review": "I went into this movie with no expectations. It wasn't until the A24 trailer released that I felt excited enough to commit to seeing this at the cinema (unlike Brave New World which I will be watching on Disney+ when it releases). Sebastian Stan and Florence Pugh are fantastic actors, and The Winter Soldier is one of my favourite characters in the franchise. So, I figured why not give this movie a chance, despite the sting of unenjoyable messes that Disney has released to the world since Endgame.It's difficult to explain the problems with this film without spoilers, and so I'm simply going to reflect my main frustrations.Firstly, nothing in this movie makes any sense. None of the characters behave in ways that are consistent with their characters or even build any sense of character. Any character could be saying what's being said or be doing what's been done. All that changes is the skin. These characters are pulled through a pre-written storyline that offers them no growth or development. They move to the next place where the story needs them to be. And we, the audience, and simply meant to accept that.Secondly, this movie acts darker than it actually is. Attempts to tackle challenging and complex issues are wrapped in Disney's usual comedy wrapper, and the events of the movie essentially eradicate any real feeling of depth. Remember when Quantumania ended and you were left expecting something \"more\" to happen to match the threat that had been presented? That!Thirdly, this movie relies far too heavily on the talent of the cast to sell it. Time and time again, this movie sets up what could have been genuinely memorable moments...only to rip them away.Overall, this movie is a very low risk-low reward installment. If you enjoyed Quantumania, Iron Man 2, Black Widow, and Thor 4, you might rate this movie quite highly. If you were expecting something new, dark, and risky, you'll be disappointed.",

While the plot isn't exactly full of twists, like many comics, it's less about surprises and more about enjoying the ride-and it absolutely delivers on that front.If you enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok, this one's right up your alley: silly humor, stunning effects, and solid performances.

            "review": "So this is what maturity looks like in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. After years of leaning on forced quips and sitcom-style dialogue, Thunderbolts arrives promising something different. Something deeper. Something grittier. But beneath the darker color grade and the serious expressions, it's still the same Marvel formula. New paint, same blueprint.It's ironic, maybe even overdue, that Marvel finally tried copying DC after more than a decade of DC trying to be Marvel. But instead of carving out a new direction, Thunderbolts plays like a sterilized version of Suicide Squad. The rough edges are gone. What remains is a movie that wants to feel bold but is constrained by its PG-13 rating and its real mission, which is selling action figures to teenagers.The marketing pushes the idea of character development. That's generous. Most of these characters already had entire shows dedicated to their arcs. If they didn't connect with audiences in six to ten hours of streaming content, they're not going to do it in two. What we get instead are a few familiar poses, another sarcastic exchange, and some recycled trauma. It's not development. It's repackaging.The story structure is painfully familiar. A shady government mission. A team of broken toys. A world-ending threat. Cue the third-act group therapy session and a last-minute save. This is Marvel's 36th film, and it plays like it was assembled by an algorithm trained on Marvel's greatest hits. That might not be a cinematic crime, but it's getting harder to care.Sure, there are a few laughs. Some of the lines land. The cast has chemistry. There are brief moments of tension before everything melts into overprocessed CGI. But when you strip away the fan service and the built-in affection for these characters, the skeleton underneath is generic and forgettable. This story could have been outlined on a napkin in fifteen minutes.The film clumsily stitches together characters from earlier titles and calls it synergy. You get three super soldiers, a sidelined Black Widow, and a handful of underdeveloped powers that never quite make visual sense. To raise the stakes, the writers throw in a god-level threat and hope no one asks why. If one Winter Soldier was enough to carry a film, then three of them plus a demigod must be worth your time, right?But the real issue isn't just recycled plots or overused archetypes. Hollywood has always done that. The problem is scale. This movie cost nearly 200 million dollars. That budget could have supported twenty other films with original ideas, new voices, and something real to say. Instead, we get a lifeless monument to franchise maintenance.There was a moment when Marvel seemed to grasp that the audience wanted more. You could see it in Daredevil, in the early promise of Moon Knight, and in the strange ambition of WandaVision. But then came She-Hulk, Thor: Love and Thunder, and a wave of content that treated depth like a liability.Thunderbolts wants to be the pivot point. It wants to announce that Marvel is ready to evolve. But it still follows the same playbook. It markets itself as bold while playing it safe. It pretends to break the mold while filling in the same tired blanks. Maybe that's enough for those happy with recycled thrills and darker lighting. But if you're hoping for something new, all you'll find here is the same old noise in a lower key.",

He doesn't have to say much, but you feel everything. He's still carrying so much weight, trying to find his place in a world that keeps changing, and honestly, same. I could watch a whole movie of just him silently judging everyone while being the reluctant dad of the group.And Florence stole every damn scene. Yelena is chaotic, dry, hilarious, weirdly heartfelt, and painfully relatable. I'd follow her into any fight, even if she's roasting me the whole way.

The kind of film where the plot moves at the speed of drying paint, where characters talk endlessly about nothing, and where any promise of action or excitement is crushed under the weight of meaningless dialogue. This is that movie-a sluggish, monotonous experience that tests the audience's patience at every turn.From the very first scene, it's clear that nothing of importance is going to happen anytime soon. The camera lingers on empty hallways, slow pans across unremarkable landscapes, and close-ups of characters sighing dramatically before speaking in long, rambling monologues. The dialogue isn't sharp or insightful-it's just *words*, endless streams of them, filling the runtime without adding depth to the story or the characters. Conversations drag on for minutes, circling the same points without resolution, as if the screenwriter was paid by the word and refused to stop typing.The characters are just as lifeless as the pacing. They stand around in dimly lit rooms, delivering lines with all the energy of someone reading a grocery list. There's no urgency in their voices, no real conflict in their interactions-just a never-ending cycle of half-baked philosophical musings and trivial observations. Even when the plot *should* pick up-when there's finally a hint of danger or a moment that could lead to action-the movie slams on the brakes, cutting away to another tedious conversation or a prolonged silence that adds nothing but runtime.And then, just when you think something might *finally* happen-when a character picks up a weapon, when a mysterious figure appears in the distance-the movie cuts to another scene of people sitting at a table, talking. And talking. And *still talking*. There's no payoff, no release of tension, just more words piling up like a traffic jam of unnecessary exposition. Even the climax-if it can be called that-is a letdown, resolving in yet another conversation instead of the action the entire film has been teasing.By the time the credits roll, the only emotion left is relief-relief that it's over, that no more time will be wasted watching characters do nothing and say everything without ever getting to the point. It's the kind of movie that makes you question why you didn't just turn it off halfway through, except that even walking away feels like it would require more energy than the film itself ever expended.In the end, this isn't just a bad movie-it's an endurance test. A masterclass in how to drain all excitement, energy, and engagement from a story, leaving behind nothing but a hollow, tedious experience. It's the cinematic equivalent of watching grass grow, except grass doesn't talk. And in this case, silence would have been a mercy.",

It has something endearing about it and is fairly memorable, I think.First, I love this whole erratic chemistry, but strong chemistry nonetheless ; and the way they assembled this team of misfits is obviously not without reminding us of these oh so tasty ensemble action movies from the 90s !!...And yeah, we have already witnessed these various characters in different situations (at the exception of a particular one), so we know what they are capable of and how things could eventually go south in and off the field quite likely, but at the same time we also have never seen them put in such a chaotic situation as a newly formed (and seemingly dysfunctional) team...But this movie's biggest strength lies in its emotional core and the way each of the different protagonists face the events that happen on their path...So it truly feels good to experience each of all this -not so- little moments and how the characters distinctively react and grow from there ; it's really nice to see how they all evolve, step by step, whether it is as a team or on their individual journeys... Yes, you feel the growth in strength of the team as a whole, how they understand each other, but moreover they instinctively end up figuring out the part they have to play for the sake of all... And this comes from each of their inner struggles and subsequently from the self discoveries that arise from that ; which is a process that is truly enjoyable to see all along the movie... Especially because Marvel Studios know how to craft these entertaining human interactions, through hilarious banters and zany situations indeed (which of course make the various connections tangible and tasty), but also by progressively carving relatable characters with life trajectories that give them a greater depth once mysteries unveil and stakes progressively rise...To be noted that the political themes (control, manipulation, corruption) as well as the introduction of a particularly iconic new character, both are a slow burn that offer a great richness to the story, once its dynamics take a new turn and the threat that was hanging over it from the shadow becomes concrete ; with some very crisp and effectively impactful scenes and moments (whether it Is through the juicy dialogues or the cool action scenes, which all have a precise purpose as well as a language that viscerally demonstrates the extent of the impact of this series of choices and events)...That was for sure a very enjoyable ride all the way, and what must be emphasized is how the whole movie is filled with a fair amount of deeply humane emotions (the psychology behind each of the characters and how each of them try to carve their way in order to find a bigger purpose in their existence despite the burden of the dark pages of their life)...which gives this film an extra soul that is everything but insignificant and takes its story to a higher level. In the end, the movie offers a pretty organic trajectory to all the main characters ; and it gives a lot of sense and meaning to what we just saw as well as future of these characters and the Marvel Cinematic Universe moving forward (the two post-credit scenes give you some more of that taste while obviously inviting you to watch the new future stories to come)... Purely delightful and quite satisfying overall ! Definitely.",

No multiverse things, no magic or socery, no high tech was what I liked about this movie. I really enjoyed a lot of hand to hand fight scenes. I was starting to feel like Marvel keeps bringing bigger threats that are way beyond us human and Earth, and yes I love to see them but I think I kinda missed just Earth level threats and characters fight against them.Shame that they didn't show much of Sentry or the void but understandable.This whole plot giving Bob emotional supports to beat the situation could be a bit lame... tho I was touched by it genuinely. I never thought a Marvel movie could give me this kinda message.Love the void's design, glad they didn't put black paint all over him lol he really looked like a shadow.",

Every moment that she's onscreen (and luckily she's onscreen a lot), she shines up the place.And Thunderbolts really does need some sunshine. From the opening Marvel logo it's a dark affair, both in visual style (the ugly saturated look makes its entrance in the MCU) as in subject matter. Don't let the funny oneliners and random banter fool you, there's a lot of pain in this new rag tag team.Thunderbolts does have a lot of fun with its underdog position. It's easy to see that Feige and co hope this team will be a new GOTG phenomenon. Unfortunately the movie feels a bit too tired to be able to do that. Despite all the reviews and ads proclaiming this will be the renaissance of the MCU: It's really just the Marvel PG 13 version of Suicide Squad.The acting is very good, the visual effects look less rushed then they did in the previous films and I really had a good time.

            "review": "I'll keep it short, but there's a lot to say here. Despite all the hype, I found the film to be largely underwhelming, especially when it came to one of the most anticipated characters: Sentry. Fans had been speculating for months about his role, imagining how his arrival would shift the balance of power in the MCU and introduce a truly complex, unstable force to the narrative. Instead, what we got was a watered-down version of the character with little substance and even less impact. Sentry didn't bring anything new or compelling to the table. His screen time was limited, his backstory was glossed over, and his powers, while visually impressive at moments, ultimately felt hollow because there was no emotional or narrative weight behind them. It was a classic case of style over substance, and the result was disappointing.On the flip side, Florence Pugh was absolutely amazing. She continues to be a standout in everything she does, and this film was no exception. Her character brought much-needed energy and charisma to every scene she was in. There's a natural authenticity in her performance that makes her incredibly watchable. Whether she was delivering dry humor or engaging in intense action sequences, she was always believable and grounded. She managed to rise above the script and direction, giving the audience something to actually care about. If there was one redeeming aspect of the film, it was her.Unfortunately, even Florence's strong performance couldn't save the film from feeling like a very big anti-climax. The buildup promised so much-massive stakes, game-changing reveals, and emotional payoff. But what we got instead was a third act that fizzled out rather than exploded. It was all far too safe, far too predictable. It felt like the writers were more interested in setting up future projects than giving this story a satisfying conclusion. Key moments that should have been shocking or powerful just kind of... happened, and then moved on. There was no time to process or feel anything, and that left the entire experience feeling emotionally flat.The post-credit scene was the final nail in the coffin. Predictable and uninspired, it felt like something we've seen a dozen times already. Instead of giving us a tantalizing glimpse of what's to come or throwing in a twist to get people talking, it simply reinforced what we already knew. It was more of a checklist item than a genuine hook. At this point, Marvel's post-credit scenes are starting to feel obligatory rather than exciting, and this one was no exception.And perhaps the most disappointing part of all was the film's over-reliance on the tired \"power of friendship\" trope. That theme can be powerful when executed well, but here it felt forced and unearned. Characters who barely had chemistry or meaningful development were suddenly treating each other like lifelong allies. There was no gradual build-up, no significant shared experiences that would justify the level of trust and emotional weight the film tried to place on their relationships. It came across as a lazy shortcut to emotional payoff, rather than something the characters or the audience had actually earned.In the end, this film had potential. It had great actors, intriguing characters, and the chance to do something bold. But instead, it played it safe and leaned on formulaic writing and hollow spectacle. With a better script and stronger direction, it could have been a standout entry. But as it stands, it's just another forgettable installment that will be quickly overshadowed by what's coming next.",

The film tackled mental health in a way I wasn't expecting, reminding us that bottling everything up isn't the answer. Instead, it encouraged facing your struggles, surrounding yourself with people who truly care, and letting them lift you up when you need it most.Of course, it wasn't all serious. David Harbour brought the humor with his signature one liners, making sure things stayed fun. What I thought would be just another MCU letdown turned into something that actually stuck with me.

            "review": "It's no secret that the MCU hasn't had a good movie (excepting Guardians 3) since Endgame, and even Endgame was more of a resolution than a great movie unto itself. The new phase has varied from mediocre to bad to Quantumania (a movie so bad, that I believe it should be it's own adjective). The one exception (G3) is more a remnant of the old era than part of the new.This is why I think alot of people are overpraising Thunderbolts, which is a nice solid movie...but is hardly amazing. If this had come out during the MCU's glory days, it would have felt like a solidly average movie by MCU standards. It would stand alongside Thor 1 or Cap 1 or Black Panther as \"yup, that's another MCU movie\". But surround it with the recent Falcon movie, Dr. Strange 2, Eternals, and so on and Thunderbolts stands tall and proud by comparison.IMHO, the best things about this movie are the actors/characters. Especially Florence Pugh, David Harbour, and Julie Louis-Dreyfus. I'd like to give Sebastian Stan a shoutout, but did Bucky really do anything but flex and look like the adult in a group of bickering children?But that is what used to make the MCU great. The MCU movies were never elite scripts/plots. They were basic fun action/comedy/spectacle movies with fun, bright characters played by actors with charisma and charm. And despite Ghost and US Agent being pretty bland, the movie mostly delivers. JLD does well as the scenery chewing villainess, Pugh and Harbour are priceless in this, as they were in Black Widow. It's still an absolute crime that Disney sat on it's thumbs and wasted it's shot at a good Black Widow movie, only producing one far too late.I also want to give the movie credit for doing a very cliche thing with the respect to Sentry, but doing it in a way that felt earned and believable, when it very easily could have been eye-rollingly stupid. If you've seen the movie, I suspect you can guess what I mean, but I don't want to spoil anything.There definitely are some moments where characters know things they shouldn't know, or where power levels seem inconsistent. I'm not going to claim it's a 'clean' movie in that respect. Some things occurred that were a bit too 'just so'. But there weren't any that took me out of the movie...except one. I really didn't like how omnipotent Sentry was from a 'super soldier program'. Every other super soldier program produced low tier super-people. Sentry was Superman+. This seems orders of magnitude beyond others, and makes it hard to swallow that there won't be a billion such programs going forward.I think the humor was okay, but not excellent. The action setpieces were fine...but seldom as impressive as some of the MCU's past offerings.I think the only person in this that really inspires 'hero' is Yelena...the others kind of all feel like joke characters. Even Bucky, despite being portrayed consistently seriously and competent doesn't really feel like a part of a headliner group...which is part of the point of course. But I feel like that lack of a standout hurts going forward. Heck, Yelena's best showcase really comes in a weak movie alot of people skipped (Black Widow) and a streaming series that even more people skipped (Hawkeye).So basically, good movie, I enjoyed it, but let's keep the praise reasonable.",

            "review": "Marvel's new film debuted in theaters with low expectations and no box office rivals.When I say low expectations, I'm talking about the general public and all the people who have abandoned the MCU ship in recent years, and not without reason. After all, the vast majority of projects haven't been entirely convincing, especially on the television front.The box office failure and critical acclaim of the last Captain America film didn't help the hype either.However, we have a film that shines brightly. It's been a long time since we've had a Marvel film that didn't need others and their connections to be popular.There's a breath of fresh air, and the MCU has the opportunity to capitalize on it.The premise is a simple film; the execution stands out quite a bit above average.While it greatly develops the characters of Yelena and Bob, and not so much others like Ghost or Bucky, we have a strong plot and a transition during the first two acts that keep us on edge and entertained.A particular fear I had was the inclusion of Red Guardian and his humor, which had already failed me in previous projects. However, here he contributes, and that's appreciated.The third act is very risky. We were coming off the Captain America movie, where, thanks to the power of the script, he was able to face Red Hulk. Here, at first glance, it seems that the power of friendship is what resolves the plot, but this is more than that... for me, everyone's embrace of Bob is the catharsis of acceptance. That's why I loved the third act so much, and I didn't miss the blows or epic battles. Anyone who has suffered from deep depression knows that no matter how hard you fight and try day after day against that emptiness that drags you down, often only those around you know that you are more than the shadow you appear to be. Accepting your condition, accepting that trying to overcome it has never worked, but rather, on the contrary, eats away at you and separates you from society even more. When you're like this, you realize that embracing it and seeking help to reach that embrace is the only thing that can save you. That depression is a part of you, and instead of trying to beat it down, the best thing is to accept it and learn to live with it.Maybe I'm overanalyzing this last part, but it really seems much deeper to me than thinking that the script could have resolved everything.Even at the end, we have time for the writers to show us an effective way to limit a character's power, and not with the classic \"I was on another planet when all this happened,\" as they did perfectly with Sentry, \"If I unleash my power, I'll also unleash that monster.\" Simply brilliant.At the end, there are two post-credits scenes, one of which has a direct connection to \"Fantastic 4\" and which opens the debate to many questions about what we'll see in July.I sincerely appreciate what Marvel did with \"Thunderbolts*,\" now I wait for what's next.",

The storyline follows a California transplant living in New York who agrees to watch his neighbor's cat while the man is away caring for his sick father. Soon, a series of strangers begin showing up at his apartment, demanding to know his neighbor's whereabouts, and subjecting him to brutal beatings and torture in the process. What are they after-and can he find a way to help them before he, and everyone he knows, ends up dead?This picture is directed by Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream) and stars Austin Butler (Elvis), Zoë Kravitz (The Batman), Matt Smith (House of the Dragon), Liev Schreiber (Scream), and Regina King (The Harder They Fall).The story is clever and unpredictable, often feeling like a Guy Ritchie crime caper-but rooted deeply in a gritty, authentic New York setting. The cast delivers elite performances, and the plot is packed with sharp twists and turns. The cinematography and camera angles are equally impressive, enhancing the tension and style throughout.The action is top-tier: abrupt fight scenes, thrilling car chases, sudden bursts of gore, and intense shootouts that all land with impact. Even the subplots, particularly those tied to the chases and crashes, are smartly executed. The ending is immensely satisfying, and the soundtrack is brilliant.In conclusion, Caught Stealing isn't perfect, but it's an unpredictable and worthwhile rollercoaster of violence, intensity, and action. I'd score it a strong 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it.",

Just after the surgery, his girlfriend gravely informs him he'll have to give up alcohol, which he'd been drowning in after the death of a friend. But just a couple of scenes later, he's not only walking around like nothing happened and still lusting after his partner-he's also back at the bar getting wasted. From that point on, both the missing kidney and the alcoholism vanish from the script. Just one of the many delightful absurdities this movie serves up.The so-called 1990s New York setting is as sloppy as the rest, and the few interesting bits play like a tired mash-up of characters stolen from Guy Ritchie or Coen brothers films-minus any of their talent or wit.Poor Butler is stuck with a charisma-free role, shapeshifting from sexy man-child to half-baked hero without reason or logic.

Their collaborations often blend sharp surrealism with Stone's fearless performances, delivering moments of brilliance that linger. But let's be honest: their relentless streak of projects is starting to feel like a one-note symphony.The issue isn't talent-Lanthimos's offbeat vision and Stone's chameleon-like acting are still top-tier. It's the sheer frequency. Back-to-back films with the same director-actor duo can sap the freshness from even the most inventive premises. Their latest efforts, while polished, echo the same quirky, detached tone and stylized weirdness that defined their earlier work. It's like watching a brilliant chef cook the same dish repeatedly-eventually, you crave a new flavor.Stone's commitment to Lanthimos's eccentric worlds is admirable, but her constant presence risks turning their films into a predictable shtick. The audience deserves variety, and both artists are versatile enough to explore beyond this partnership. A break to work with other directors or actors could reinvigorate their craft and give us something new to savor. For now, this once-exciting collaboration feels like it's overstayed its welcome, leaving a stale aftertaste.",

This film is not just for current fans or fans from the start, it also speaks to everyone. This is the Superman film that we might not have asked but it is definitely what we needed. This does not just focus on the superhero genre. It's a roller-coaster action packed yet it has the emotion and heart of a superhero story. It does not just showed Superman that he is invincible. It also showed his weaknesses, yet he still shows that he is a man of hope.The film also did not waste other characters. Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, the Justice Gang played important parts. Hoult's performance was Lex Luthor was insane! The Fortress of Solitude was also not sidelined. And there's Krypto! Man Krypto definitely stole the show! Brosnahan's Lois Lane was really well executed and Corenswet as Clark Kent / Superman was really amazing!The film also had its surprises but overall, it is very well made. James Gunn, you outdid yourself again this time! Thank you for bringing this to life. Probably the best film this year so far! A definite worth the watch!",

            "review": "Let's get one thing out of the way: I'm not a Superman fan. Never have been. It's hard to root for a nigh-invincible alien with the moral compass of a saint. I've always been more of a Batman guy-brooding billionaires with trauma just feel more... grounded. If it weren't for James Gunn at the helm, my excitement for yet another Superman reboot would be close to zero. As a huge fan of his work-from the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy to The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker, and Creature Commandos-I found myself intrigued. But even then, a question lingered in the back of my mind: Gunn has always excelled with underdogs, outcasts, and oddballs-could he really make the world's most squeaky-clean superhero compelling? The answer? A thunderous, emphatic YES.With Superman , James Gunn delivers the most emotionally resonant and thematically mature version of this beloved hero to date. The result is a film that dares to reimagine the Last Son of Krypton not as a god among men, but as a man who just happens to be a god. And it works. Beautifully.Thanks to a nuanced script and David Corenswet's pitch-perfect performance, Superman is-dare I say-relatable. Charming, earnest, even a little naïve, Corenswet captures the essential contradiction at the heart of the character: an alien more human than most of us. He's the best portrayal of Clark Kent since Christopher Reeve. Don't get me wrong, Cavill was good and had the look of Superman, but Corenswet has the soul-the farm-raised, kind-hearted boy who just wants to do what is good.Gunn smartly skips the well-worn origin story and throws us into the thick of it-an Earth already grappling with the existence of Superman. It's a move that keeps the pacing lean and allows the story to dig deeper into the world around him. And this world feels real. In a classic Gunn fashion, he weaves in sharp, timely commentary on media weaponization, current foreign affairs, and public trust. Superman's challenges are not just physical-they're moral, political, philosophical. And yet, the film never feels like it's lecturing. It just feels-timely, relevant, necessary.The emotional core is surprisingly affecting. Clark's dynamic with Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan, nailing the fierce, no-nonsense reporter) crackles with genuine tension and warmth. They bicker, they banter, they love. It's messy. It's real. Add to that the tender scenes with Clark's parents, and you have a superhero movie that somehow manages to be...intimate. When Superman tears up at a simple word from his stepdad, it hits harder than any CGI explosion.Tonally, it's classic Gunn-light and fun, with moments that feel ripped straight out of a Saturday morning cartoon. But it's not all laughs. The humor is dialed back, used sparingly and smartly. There's surprising darkness here too-moments of genuine menace and even shocking to say the least.As for the supporting cast, Nicholas Hoult's Lex Luthor is the best version we've seen on screen-cold, calculating, and utterly despicable. He's not a hammy businessman or a twitchy tech bro. He's evil, and chillingly rational about it. You want to punch him in the face. Repeatedly. That's a win. Rachel Brosnahan's Lois Lane is the definitive version-a relentless truth-seeker with zero time for nonsense. Nathan Fillion's Green Lantern is exactly what you'd expect from a James Gunn regular: a lovable asshole with some truly laugh-out-loud moments (creative use of his ring). Isabela Merced's Hawkgirl brings welcome edge, and Edi Gathegi's Mr. Terrific nearly steals the show with one of the most memorable fight sequences in the film.It's not a perfect film, though. For all its triumphs, I found myself wanting more-particularly of the Clark and Lois interactions. The film's strongest moments are its quietest ones, and at times, those are sacrificed for screen time spent on less compelling side characters. The pacing is tight, but I would've gladly traded a few action beats for more of those humanizing character moments that made this version of Superman so special. That said, the inclusion of Krypto the Superdog is a delight. Watching a nearly all-powerful being struggle to handle a naughty superdog? Every pet owner can relate.Still, by the time the credits rolled, I knew one thing: Superman is everything I wanted it to be-and then some. If this film is any indication of the direction James Gunn's DCU is heading, then DC is in very good hands. For the first time, I can honestly say that I want more of DC.In a time where the world feels more divided, more cynical, and more exhausted than ever, this film reminds us why Superman matters. He's not just about flying fast, lifting buildings, or stopping Kaijus. He's about compassion. About kindness. About doing the right thing not for glory, but because it's the right thing to do. We need that now. We need him now. He made me believe once again that there is hope.",

I didn't honestly think Gunn would come out with such a bang on this as he did. The suicide squad was fun and showed his signature style but this is on a different level entirely . The bombastic visuals are usual and packed to the brim, but what this film does best is deliver an emotional aspect that hasn't been this prevalent in the genre for a long time . That's what I think will stick with people more than the action. I don't want to get into detail too much as we are very early in the reviews but this will have people blown away and fully ready to embrace the Gunnverse.

The tone is all over the place - cringey one-liners, awkward slapstick, and visuals that look like they belong in a Saturday morning cartoon. Instead of being a bold reimagining, it feels like a step back into campy territory no one really asked for.David Corenswet, while a decent lookalike, completely fails to capture the commanding presence and charisma that Henry Cavill brought to the role. Cavill had gravitas - a balance of strength, vulnerability, and quiet intensity. Corenswet feels... light. Like he's playing dress-up rather than embodying Earth's greatest protector.Worse, the theater itself reflected the film's flat tone. The room was dead quiet - barely a chuckle, almost no reaction. It was a sharp contrast to the electric energy I felt during Deadpool vs Wolverine, where the whole crowd was engaged, laughing, reacting. This Superman? It just didn't land.Compared to Man of Steel, which had emotional depth, stunning visuals, and a powerful score, this version feels hollow. It might please kids or hardcore nostalgia fans, but it's missing soul.Rating: 6/10 - Looks like Superman, but lacks the heart, presence, and impact. For something truly heroic, revisit Man of Steel.",

This wasn't some quirky or forgettable villain - he embodied the true essence of Lex: manipulative, dangerous, and terrifyingly intelligent. You could feel the hatred and obsession radiating from him. This Lex Luthor isn't a Lego piece in Superman's story - he's the monster in the mirror, and Hoult deserves every bit of praise.David Corenswet? He delivered. He gave us a Superman who felt - not just someone who flies and fights, but someone who struggles, loves, hurts, and hopes. And Rachel Brosnahan as Lois? She owns that role. Her chemistry with David was undeniable. I've never shipped Lois and Clark harder - they're everything.And James Gunn... chef's kiss. The tone. The visuals. The storytelling.

The biggest issue is the script. For some reason, the director chose to throw the audience straight into the middle of the action, with almost no background or introduction for the main character. Some might argue that Superman's origin story is no longer necessary, but in my view, it's absolutely essential for a full-fledged reboot. This is David Corenswet's first appearance as Clark Kent, and the film clearly lacks at least 30 minutes of emotional buildup to help us connect with him. Without that foundation, it's hard to truly care about his character.The same goes for the rest of the cast. Lex Luthor lacks a clear motivation: he wants to destroy Superman right from the start, but there's no deeper reasoning behind it. Clark's relationship with his adoptive parents is barely shown - they appear only in a few short scenes. His connection with Lois Lane also feels shallow. There's no real chemistry between them, and their relationship seems to develop entirely off-screen. As a result, it feels more like we're watching the second installment in a franchise rather than the first.Another serious flaw is the overload of secondary heroes. The audience is thrown into a new world packed with characters: Green Lantern, Mister Terrific, Hawkgirl, Metamorpho, The Engineer, Ultraman - all of whom show up, but almost none receive meaningful screen time (Mister Terrific is arguably the most developed). They're hard to remember, let alone care about. For the average viewer unfamiliar with the DC Universe, it's genuinely overwhelming. «BATMAN V SUPERMAN» was heavily criticized for a similarly chaotic structure, yet despite sharing the same flaws, Gunn's latest film is somehow receiving mostly positive reviews. I just don't get it.So, for the first film in the rebooted DC Universe (DCU), I expected a more coherent, emotionally rich, and self-contained story. For many viewers - especially newcomers - this movie might feel chaotic and overcrowded. And, in essence, that's exactly how it is. In just two hours of runtime, Gunn packed in so much that it could have easily been stretched out into an entire season of a TV series.6/10P. S. I'm not a Zack Snyder fan, even though I'm aware of his massive fanbase. Personally, I see him as a strong visionary but a weak writer and director. Still, I have to be honest: his «MAN OF STEEL» left a far deeper impression on me than James Gunn's new «SUPERMAN». As disappointing as that is - especially given how much I admire Gunn's previous work - I have to speak frankly about how I feel.",

I also love that Kim Boden from Killing Eve was in this he's great and Kerry Condon is one of the most lovely beings!",

The IMAX scenes were fantastic. No shortage of those. The story was a classic underdog story. Still pretty good in my opinion. There was some pretty good comedy mixed in. The amount of advertising from companies was INSANE. There really was a lot.The music was fantastic. I wish we heard more, but the main songs were barely in the movie. Just bits of it mainly the start of the songs. I was most hyped to hear \"Messy\" and \"Just Keep Watching\" but it was only like 15 seconds of each song played back to back. I was really looking forward to hearing the full song in theater but oh wellWorth a one time watch.",

From the very first scene, you can tell this was made to be watched in a theater - it's loud, fast, emotional, and immersive in all the right ways.The cinematography is stunning - easily the best I've seen in a racing film since Rush, maybe even since Top Gun: Maverick. The sound design and musical score elevate every race scene to something visceral and epic. I genuinely got chills more than once.Sure, there are a few moments that feel a bit cliché or unrealistic, especially if you're deeply familiar with the world of Formula 1. But the film's technical brilliance and emotional punch more than make up for that.In short: this movie is a love letter to F1 and to cinema itself. Whether you're a hardcore motorsport fan or just looking for an intense, high-octane story - you'll be in for a ride.",

            "review": "Jerry Bruckheimer is 81 years old, and somehow still cranking out the exact same movie - and selling it. Time and again, he brings in directors who fully bend to his vision, making his movie instead of their own.The case of F1 is a particularly clear echo. Back in 1986, Bruckheimer tapped then-little-known Tony Scott to direct Top Gun. Four years later, he brought Scott back for Days of Thunder, which was basically Top Gun with NASCAR. Fast forward to 2022, and it's Joseph Kosinski who remakes Top Gun, beat for beat, as Top Gun: Maverick. Now, in F1, Bruckheimer teams up with Kosinski again - and sure enough, it's Top Gun: Maverick, but with Formula 1 cars.At a certain point, it feels like an insult to the audience's intelligence. But in truth, Bruckheimer has long understood something most Hollywood producers only pretend to: audiences don't mind watching the same movie over and over, as long as it's shiny enough. And to his credit, the production values do keep getting better.The racing sequences in F1 are undeniably stunning. The opening stretch offers fresh, immersive angles that genuinely make you sit up. That sensation wears off, but the racing remains the movie's strongest element. Everything else - the character moments, the romance, the bromance - mostly feels like filler while you wait for the next lap.It gets repetitive. A little boring. Occasionally silly. But the technical craft keeps it from ever fully derailing. Brad Pitt and Javier Bardem both deliver solid performances, even if the script gives them very little to work with.",

            "review": "F1: The Movie is a new sports film directed, co-written, and produced by Joseph Kosinski, known for Tron: Legacy and Top Gun: Maverick.Promising Formula 1 driver Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) ended his career in the 1990s after a serious accident. Still, he continued to race as a hired driver.When team boss Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem) is in search of a new driver for his Formula 1 team, he turns to Sonny for help. Sonny agrees, but insists on racing in his own way.He is paired with Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), the young talent on the team, and their styles and experiences clash. Still, the two must find a way to work together to give their team a shot at victory.Following his success with Top Gun: Maverick, in which Joseph Kosinski made audiences feel as if they were right there in the cockpit with Tom Cruise, he tries to achieve the same with F1. And indeed: the racing scenes are impressively shot, at times making you feel like you're actually inside Brad Pitt's race car. Visually, the film certainly impresses.However, F1: The Movie is less innovative when it comes to its story. The plot of an older, headstrong driver having to inspire or challenge the younger generation has already been seen in films like Le Mans '66 (Ford v Ferrari) and Rush. F1 seems to combine elements from these predecessors, but as a result, doesn't create a truly original or distinctive narrative.Despite the high pace of the races, the film includes several slow moments. Or the opposite: the transitions between races can be so abrupt that it becomes hard to follow. The plot remains fairly predictable, often making it easy to sense where things are headed.As with Top Gun: Maverick, many cast members performed their own stunts. Brad Pitt and Damson Idris drove the actual race cars themselves, with stunt drivers only used for dangerous scenes-though this is hardly noticeable on screen.Still, F1 doesn't quite replicate the same realistic feeling as Top Gun: Maverick, where Tom Cruise did all his stunts himself. His familiar face and physical presence were always visible, which contributed to the immersion. That sense of presence is less consistently achieved in F1.",

            "review": "In 2022, Joseph Kosinski's 'Top Gun Maverick' took the world by storm. A sequel to Tony Scott's 1986 classic, the Tom Cruise starrer took in over $1.496 billion worldwide, the highest grossing Cruise vehicle to date. Praised by critics and audiences alike, it was widely seen as the film that reignited the global box office after the COVID-19 shutdowns, with Steven Spielberg calling it the saviour of \"the entire theatrical industry.\"Kosinski's directorial follow-up, 'Spiderhead,' flew under the radar, not offering much (other than a great Chris Hemsworth performance). His newest effort, 'F1' desperately wants to be 'Top Gun Maverick.' The narrative is essentially the same, but swaps the skies for the pits. It follows renegade racer Sonny Hayes, who is brought out of retirement to mentor a hot-headed young prodigy and help turn a struggling team into contenders. Amidst tension in the garage and friction on the track, can Hayes beat the odds?If it sounds familiar, that's because it is. For a film about one of the most exciting and fast-paced sports there is, 'F1' is shockingly dull and predictable. Clearly aimed at the same audience that loved the electrifying dog-fights of 'Top Gun: Maverick,' it is a non-starter in nearly every regard: a film about speed that never gets out of first gear. The narrative isn't just derivative of the Cruise blockbuster- it also echoes dozens of sports films where a grizzled veteran returns for one last shot at redemption.Full of cliches, stilted dialogue and cardboard cut-out characters, it lacks the excitement of John Frankenheimer's masterful 'Grand Prix,' the tension of Lee H. Katzin's 'Le Mans', the bravado of Tony Scott's 'Days of Thunder' and the fun of Gordon Chan's 'Thunderbolt,' as well as the emotion of Sydney Pollack's admittedly troublesome 'Bobby Deerfield.'Although Pollack's film was- and still is- by no means spectacular, it boasts far more interesting, multi-dimensional characters than Kosinski and co-writer Ehren Kruger came up with. Sonny is a walking cliché, who is about as compelling and well-rounded as a blank piece of paper. Neither he, nor any of his supporting characters, display any growth over the course of the film, and the emotional stakes are contrived.Further, the interactions between said characters lack spark or authenticity, as if torn from a 'Screenwriting Guidebook for Dummies'. Conversations trudge along, weighed down by stilted, on-the-nose lines, hammering home the obvious. Instead of feeling like real people with real conflicts, the characters merely recite plot points, leaving every exchange flat and lifeless. The film's attempts at emotional depth fall embarrassingly short, drowning under a tide of awkward exposition and contrived banter.Technically, the film has a lot more to offer. Fast-paced and frequently gripping, 'F1' boasts dynamic camerawork from Claudio Miranda, brilliantly capturing the adrenaline of a race. Furthermore, the crisp editing from Stephen Mirrione and Patrick J. Smith heightens the visceral nature of proceedings. Some of the races are pulse-poundingly intense and beautifully caught on camera; they'll have you on the edge of your seat.Additionally, the atmospheric sound design immerses one fully in the roar of engines and screech of tires. Hans Zimmer's score is evocative and thrilling, amplifying the tension and excitement throughout. The soundtrack also features a handful of great songs from the likes of Led Zeppelin and Queen (though they're never used to their full potential- often dropped in with little impact and quickly faded out). However, all these technical elements combine to create an undeniably exciting sensory experience- if only the story and characters were as finely tuned.Brad Pitt stars as Hayes, a role that asks little more of him than to look cool. No one can do that better than Pitt, but charisma alone can only carry a character so far. His talents are wasted on a part that offers no real nuance, development or dramatic challenge. His supporting cast- stacked with skilled performers like Kerry Condon, Damson Idris, Kim Bodnia and Javier Bardem (as well as Shea Whigham in a glorified cameo)- is similarly shortchanged, each saddled with one-note roles of little to no depth.Despite all the noise, 'F1' never finds its footing. It's a film that looks the part, sounds the part and moves like a blockbuster- but under the hood, it's running on empty. Director Joseph Kosinski clearly knows how to orchestrate spectacle, but spectacle without soul only gets you so far. With a flat script and hollow characters, not even a star as magnetic as Brad Pitt can steer it to victory. In trying so hard to replicate the triumph of 'Top Gun: Maverick,' 'F1' fails to blaze its own trail, ending up stalled at the starting line.",

A dark comedy with Benedict C and Olivia C sounded good, so off to the cinema we went (parents + 17 yo son).What an incredibly boring and painfully unfunny failure this turned out to be. Both partners in the couple were just unbearably annoying and selfish, how they could have ever fallen for each other remained a mystery. Their supposed ascerbic British wit, apparently hugely exotic for Americans, was neither clever nor funny - it just felt off (I generously add a point to my score for the scene at the marriage counsellor, which I found mildly amusing).They also had an exceedingly poor taste in friends - I would honestly rather slit my wrists than spend an evening with any of them and Amy in particular. Even their US marine corps type children where annoying. The premise of a comedy about a marriage gone bad because of the shifting fortunes of the partners and a bitterly fought divorce holds a lot of promise. But unfortubately none of the characters were remotely believable, likeable or interesting, and the same goes for the dialogue. Worst of all: while the film clearly aimed to be a comedy it was just simply not funny.When the lights went on again we all just laughed about how unbelievably stupid this film is and debated which of the characters we hated most.Razzie-worthy so Ivy better take her EpiPen with her.",

It is genuinely hilarious, sweet and tragic all at the same time.I won't give away the ending, but while it makes some changes to how the 1989 version ended, it also doesn't take away its cautionary tale aspect. It is also hugely critical of the material wealth that people accumulate when they become successful with their jobs.The two leads have great chemistry and work excellently together.

The husband, a suave architect turned stay-at-home dad, is weirdly weakened, his charisma undercut by odd choices. The wife, funny and talented, just doesn't match his polish, making their pairing feel off. Some dark humor hits, but clunky lines about cultural baggage or male confidence grate more than they amuse. This 2025 take strays far from Warren Adler's 1981 novel, a vicious, apolitical satire of marriage gone wrong. The 1989 film nailed that raw edge, but this version's modern spin-loaded with social commentary-would likely have Adler fuming. It feels like a classic story twisted to chase trends.

The scene in the rifle range meant to be funny was totally offensive in view of the ongoing violence.The script writers Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara's overuse of \"f\" and \"c\" bombs that were never necessary in the original movie that starred Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner really added to my dislike this ugly movie.It's so disappointing to see such talented actors star in what for me was a total waste of time and talent.An amendment- there was one likeable character - THE WHALE.",

I loved the original and was happy to see an update and prepared for the ride. Unfortunately, this version was a disappointment in spite of Benedict Cumberbatch's top notch performance after so many other incredible performances in an impressive resume of films. He made this charactor his own and he eats up the screen in every scene he is in. I would have rated the film a 9 if we could stop there. But we can't. I am shocked to say that Olivia Colman (who I have loved in everything I've seen her in...up till now, is so miscast and the charactor is so anoying, it ruins the movie. This story and the original movie, vollys happiness, love, disappointment, and hatred back and forth between the 2 main charactors and you get that with Cumberbatche's performance. I can't say the same for Coleman. Right from the very start, the attaction between the two charactors is not believeable. Coleman is a great actress, but the miscasting is so distracting It made her scenes difficult to watch. Andy Samberg's supporting role is unremarkable as well Kate McKinnon as his wife.

            "review": "Reimagining a classic film can be tricky business, especially when it involves one that's well-liked and well-known. But, with the right team behind such a project, the result can be positively delightful, and such is definitely the case with this reworking of the 1989 dark comedy, \"The War of the Roses.\" In fact, in this case, I'd even go so far as to say that this new production is actually an improvement over its often-overrated predecessor. Director Jay Roach's scathingly biting comedy follows the lives of Theo and Ivy Rose (Benedict Cumberbatch, Olivia Colman), a pair of successful British professionals who quickly fall madly in love, marry and resettle in northern California, eventually becoming the proud parents of two children. Theo is an accomplished architect, while Ivy is a gifted but underconfident chef who concocts spectacular culinary creations that only her family gets to sample. However, when Theo lands a plum contract to design a museum, he comes into a windfall whose proceeds he gifts to Ivy to launch her own eatery. As fate would have it, though, the partners' fortunes trade places, with Ivy becoming a huge hit that leads to the opening of a chain of restaurants and Theo's career taking an unexpected tumble, relegating him to the role of househusband as he struggles to revive his sagging reputation. This invariably leads to mounting petty jealousies and intensifying marital discord between two spouses who ostensibly once seemed to love one another deeply - and all with wickedly hilarious results. So what makes this version of the Roses' story better than its forerunner? Several factors play into this, but nearly all of them are tied to the vastly improved writing at work here compared to the original. The scope of the narrative has been significantly enlarged in this iteration, and all to the better, primarily due to the inclusion of an array of colorful supporting characters and a diverse palette of genuinely sidesplitting scenarios. In addition, the dialogue is crisper, snappier and faster paced, enabling the story to flow more like a screwball comedy than an embittered, often-dour and frequently nasty exercise. That's not to suggest the lack of an edge in this updated production; quite the contrary. But the pacing, delivery and contents of its inspired and devastatingly hard-hitting one-liners are virtually nonstop, giving the picture a rapid-fire immediacy that its predecessor frequently lacked. Those qualities are further enhanced by sharper character development and the award-worthy spot-on performances of the two leads, whose undeniable chemistry makes their portrayals even more compellingly on target. Add to that the incisive contributions of the film's fine ensemble (most notably Kate McKinnon, Andy Samberg and Allison Janney), and you've got a cinematic formula that truly fires on all cylinders. Admittedly, there are a few elements that could have been handled a little differently, and some aspects of the screenplay feel a little overwritten at times, but these shortcomings are so minor that they're hardly worth mentioning. Considering how well everything meshes in this production, I must confess that I'm somewhat surprised the picture was saddled with a late August release, typically one of the movie industry's distribution wastelands. I was also concerned in advance that this could have turned out to be another of those misguided remakes that have come to characterize many of filmdom's high-profile releases these days. But \"The Roses\" delivers the goods across the board and genuinely deserves an appreciative audience for its efforts as one of 2025's better offerings, especially in the comedy genre. Don't let preconceptions stand in your way of giving this one a look - you won't regret it.",

            "review": "LIKES:\nThe Dialogue\nThe Humor\nThe Tactics\nThe Messages\nThe Cinematography\nThe Acting\nSummary:\nA remake of a classic requires either precision to the material with a new artistic style, or a meaningful twist worthy of making the new movie. The Roses does a bit of both, but leans heavily into the second part to try and give something fresh to the classic tale of a lover's spat gone horribly wrong. Roach's vision is very articulate and comedy-heavy, focusing on integrating British dialogue delivery with two very distinct comedy styles. The dialogue is smart, blending British colloquialisms with American aggression into a sizzling sandwich of stylish humor. It offers varying degrees of mature comedy, doing their best to get a laugh as each member brings their own brand of laughs into the film. And to have deeper moments that feel authentic and not just a simple SNL sketch fest, which I was worried it could be. But the movie is very tactful with the humor and writing, always keeping this classic tale alive despite the new directions it chose. Those tactics further show up as the story progresses to the \"peak\" of tension, a new set of cunning tactics to evolve the disdain that injects more humor into this exaggerated argument turned very morose. I won't say much to avoid spoilers, but the modernization works well to poke fun at the new-age attitudes that you see fill up social media platforms, and I had fun with some of the new twists they chose to include. And yet, within all this chaotic comedy, the film holds onto the underlying message of marriage and what can tax a relationship with all the pressures of high success it brings. It might be buried under a lot of things, but this installment, I think, accomplishes a lot in demonstrating just what emotions, thoughts, attitudes, and reactions to such a relationship can bring, as well as the complicated concepts of hard work that love brings with it through the difficult times, especially with these key moments where everything comes together.Speaking of coming together, the actual craft of the movie gains points in regard to how the movie comes together for me. The Roses may not be fully state-of-the-art, nor design some of the most unique worlds capable of high-fantasy royalty. However, the movie is shot well, with beautiful camera work helping get all the right shots to give you the full majesty of the scene in terms of emotion and comedic prowess. I loved those moments where you get this facial profile that holds so much beneath the skin as they convey the feelings boiling within. Or when you get this exchange of characters around a table, where tensions start to mount, and the actions that come with it are just as ludicrous as the behavior in public. The Roses' camera teams get it all on film, with editing that helps pull it all together in a well-crafted film. But the acting is the biggest benefit for this reviewer, holding much of the heart of this film and conveying what the War of the Roses' plot is all about. Every actor does their part, a certain character qualm that is often a single-toned character that exists for a comedic opening and little more. McKinnon and Andy Samberg have a bit more layering to them, primarily comedic with their SNL style of aggressive one-liners, awkward banter, and over-the-top emphasis to make many chuckle if you like such stressed and zany lines. However, they do have those nuggets of emotional treasure I mentioned earlier, elements I wish I had gotten just a bit more of to give me a better balance and more meaningful drive to the end. It's the leads who have the most complexity for me, both having this complex mixture of dramatic flair, authentic anger, and wit, with an expert level of artistry that I absolutely feel into. They have such great chemistry, somehow managing to step into every facet of this complex comedy, always keeping in time with the scene, but still giving it their all. It's a wonderful display of balance, doing their best with the spectrum of comedic styles this movie required of them. This relationship is the key to enjoying this movie, and it is a blessing to have these leads do the impossible.DISLIKES:\nVery Somber Material\nVicious\nToo Dry For Some\nImbalance Of Characters\nCrosses Lines\nThe Language Is Very Aggressive\nNiche Comedy\nSummary\nWhere the movie is going to be a turn off for some is going to come in the very cynical nature of the material. The Roses movie deals with a lot of hard material, the relationship itself holding lots of triggering moments that may be hard for an audience member to watch. Such somber material may be hard to handle, and the negative emotions do sort of slow things down and might not be entertaining when you are getting subjected to how much is layered in this couple's love. It's vicious, with some actions and words perhaps being too much to bear with what is said. Sensitive viewers need to be warned that some awful things might be said without a sincere apology to make it better, and if that enrages you, this movie again is a trigger. And as things heat up, the viciousness crosses into levels that only dark humor appreciates or those who love a really good Soap Opera Diva. If that isn't enough to dissuade you, I also didn't enjoy the saturation of coarse language, the choices of insults, yelling, and other words that check a lot of boxes on my list that I don't like. Such aggressive language is often paired with actions that cross a lot of lines, and I warn sensitive viewers that sometimes they take it a tad too far with this rendition, which I found myself wondering if I would stay.Once you get past the darker material, the other thing to remember is that this is a very dry movie, with comedy that sometimes is aggressive, silly, and inappropriate, with a more direct approach, but a lot of it has that touch of British approach that may be too stiff. If you don't enjoy such antics, I won't say this movie isn't for you, but you might not want to have a film where you have to think a bit about the banter or wrap your head around how far they are willing to go. And if you are going for a particular star, this also felt like a limitation to me, primarily because of how imbalanced the character usage was. The leads are the stars for much of the movie, with Samberg and McKinnon having the next greatest time level. However, other stars are going to kind of get the shaft, again, primarily as comedic relief or an opening with only a few jokes to get the ball rolling. The story feels a bit chopped up as well, and perhaps a bit more character integration and focus on the tale could have helped mitigate some of these issues. Finally, the movie feels very niche; the combination of all these comedic styles with the very morose plot narrows the audience who might enjoy this down to a much smaller audience.The VERDICT:\nThe Roses is an interesting twist to the classic material, with a heavy comedy focus to help make the movie relevant in the modern world. A fantastic acting duo is the star of this movie, helping to deliver complex comedy, authentic relationships, animosity to no avail, and still drop the witty dialogue that is written in this movie. The solid writing, decent pacing, and multiple styles keep things moving, helping find those small moments of relief in this intense film, and all with a great cinematic atmosphere that movies do well. However, the wit of this film, the intelligent comedy, and direction may only cater to a limited audience. The Roses film is a dryer piece to enjoy, requiring strong fortitude for the material, handling the very unhealthy elements our \"heroes\" choose to pursue, and being desensitized to the aggressive language that this film was not afraid to run into. All of these aggressive elements are potential triggers, and I encourage everyone to be very cautious before choosing to handle this film. Is it worth a trip to the theater? While there is a lot of good, most are going to want to keep to home viewing for this film. Upon factoring that element in, I give The Roses:Tragedy/Comedy/Satire: 8.0\nMovie Overall: 7.0.",

Demons irl would be partying bc of that Movie because it's doing a pretty good job in luring them in man.The lead singer of the boyband is punished for being selfish and choosing lust and wealth over his family - which is a valid consequence, where exactly is the problem??. However, by the end of the film, his suffering is portrayed as tragic, and his final act of self-sacrifice is framed as redemption. This raises the issue of whether every wrongdoing can truly be undone with a single heroic act. In reality, actions have consequences, and some of them are irreversible.The main character didn't choose her fate, so her situation is more understandable. Still, it would be refreshing to see a story with a genuine villain and a new narrative direction that doesn't rely solely on the theme of \"accept who you are.\" Like these Stories are so overly done, every movie these day seems to be a \"accept who you are\". Like no? Pls don't, we should move forward and be willing to change in order to improve and grow beautifully.By comparison, the movie Ne Zha handles a similar concept - a cursed child destined to become a demon - but changes his fate and questions himself- with much more nuance and depth, handling a similar topic way better.That said, the show does have strong animation, a few funny moments, and well-executed choreography.

I mean, it is that, no mistake about that, but it's not just a cash-grab. The story, if you think about it, is kind of simplistic and predictable, but I do not think it was aiming for something complex. It's a fairy tale. You know, like Snow White? What makes it stand out is the delivery.The music is good. I am not a fan of KPop, aside maybe a couple of songs, and I can remember only one of them (I'm a Pop), but the songs sounded good to my ears with just a few moments sounding a bit off. Not as in \"off-tune\", but as in \"do not fit\" either overall song structure or what's happening on screen. Those are nitpicks, though. Totally not like Snow White.Animation is great, the style overall. I really like that it's not taking itself or the pop culture too seriously, and expresses it through the goofy animations. But they are not just for giggles: they paint human (and humane) characters. Female characters, Disney, take note! The girls can kick some ass, they like to goof about, when they can, but at the same time, they do have their troubles (especially Rumi), and they overcome them together and go pursue their passions in order to give to the world.Will this movie change the world as original Snow White did? Probably not. We live in a different world now, after all. But what it does is deliver a light-hearted and full-hearted story, which also delivers proper satisfaction when it ends, and may even inspire some kids. Because the movie shows good traits (and perseverance) and not just talks about them.

What stood out to me the most was the way it explored the theme of self-acceptance. The characters aren't perfect-they make mistakes, they have fears, and they face struggles-but that's what makes them so real and relatable. The film reminds us that it's okay to be flawed, and that we don't need to hide our insecurities from the people who care about us. Vulnerability isn't weakness-it's a kind of strength. And sometimes, showing our true selves, even the parts we think are \"too much,\" is exactly what helps us grow and connect more deeply with others.The music was another huge highlight for me. Every song was super catchy and I've already added several tracks to my Spotify playlist. I also loved the performance scenes-they were dynamic, visually stunning, and full of personality.Visually, the film is breathtaking. The character designs, costumes, and animation are all so detailed and vibrant. You can clearly see the love and effort that went into every frame. Each character has a distinct style that reflects their personality, and the fusion of K-pop aesthetics with demon-hunting action creates a world that feels both exciting and immersive.And I can't forget to mention the \"enemies to lovers\" subplot-it had me hooked from the start! That kind of dynamic is one of my favorites, and this one was done so well. The chemistry, the tension, the emotional payoff... it gave me all the feels.

It's clear the animators put time and care into the production, and they deserve credit for that. Unfortunately, that's about the only positive thing I can say. Beneath the glossy surface is a painfully shallow story filled with clichés, one-dimensional characters, and absolutely no surprises.The plot is as thin as it gets and offers nothing beyond what you'd guess from the title. It's yet another forbidden romance-this time between a demon and the hunter tasked with killing her. If that sounds familiar, it's because it is. The \"impossible love\" angle has been done a thousand times before, and this movie brings nothing new to the table. There's no twist, no subversion, no deeper commentary. It plays out exactly the way you'd expect from the very first scene.The romance between the hunter and the demon is the kind of forced, hollow connection that feels like it was pulled straight from a checklist. There's no genuine chemistry between the two leads-just a few longing glances, some shared trauma, and suddenly we're supposed to believe they're soulmates. The film never earns the emotional weight it tries to push onto the audience. It wants you to feel something profound, but never gives you a reason to. Instead of building a believable relationship, it leans on melodrama and overused tropes to try and tug at the heartstrings. It doesn't work.Character development is almost nonexistent. The hunter is your typical brooding, emotionally stunted male lead, carrying the burden of a tragic past that we're meant to find deep but really just feels lazy. The demon girl is the standard misunderstood beauty-gentle, kind, and of course, not like \"other demons.\" Their motivations are vague, their dialogue flat, and their arcs (if you can call them that) are rushed and unsatisfying. You never feel like these are real people facing real stakes. They're just archetypes acting out a pre-written drama.Worse still, the pacing is all over the place. The movie starts slow, dragging through setup scenes that tell rather than show. Then suddenly, major plot developments are crammed into rushed sequences with no time to breathe. Emotional turning points arrive out of nowhere, and by the end, everything feels simultaneously drawn-out and underdeveloped. It's as if the movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a slow-burn romance or a fast-paced fantasy epic-and it ends up failing at both.As for worldbuilding, there's barely any. The setting hints at an interesting backdrop-some kind of war between humans and demons-but it's never explored. You're given just enough to keep the plot moving, but not enough to feel immersed or invested. The film wastes an opportunity to flesh out its world, relying instead on familiar fantasy tropes and vague exposition.Ultimately, this movie feels like a missed opportunity. The visual quality deserved a much better story. Instead, we got a lazily written, emotionally empty film that thinks pretty animation is enough to carry everything else. It's not. Good animation can enhance a movie, but it can't replace thoughtful writing, meaningful character development, or originality.If you're just looking for something pretty to watch in the background, maybe this will do. But if you're hoping for a story that sticks with you, characters you care about, or a romance that actually feels real, you're going to be disappointed. I know I was.",

So I virtually didn't know what I was in for here, and thus had no expectations.Writers Danya Jimenez, Hannah McMechan, Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans put together a fair enough script and storyline. It made for a fair enough entertaining viewing experience, though it was a bit corny actually. It was definitely an original concept idea.There are some puzzling mistakes throughout the narrative. For example, while the trio is fighting the demons aboard the plane and singing, they someone carried on with the song once they landed at the arena where their show was to be held, which indicated that the fans have been listening along to the singing in the plane, otherwise it would have been a strange out of context and short song. And then there was the fact that the fans could sing along to the newly released single, even though the fans were listening to it for the first time.I was wondering why the dialogue was in English, if this was supposed to be KPop (Korean Pop). It should be noted that the voice acting in \"KPop Demon Hunters\" was good, despite of it being in English.The animation style and art style used in \"KPop Demon Hunters\" was vibrant, colorful and good. I liked that part about it, that I will definitely admit.The songs in the movie was, however, mostly bordering on being annoying. But of course that stems from it being so far from the genre of music that I listen to normally.Watchable, for sure, but I am sure that a younger audience will enjoy this animated movie a lot more than I did. Not that I didn't enjoy \"KPop Demon Hunters\".My rating of \"KPop Demon Hunters\" lands on a five out of ten stars.",

It has some of the best twists I've seen in a long time. It allows a great look into Korean pop culture and the songs not only help with the plot but also aren't a typical Disney song. The animation is stunning and beautiful. My only complaint is the lip sinc for some of the songs don't quite match up but to have a complete original movie that can be enjoyed by all audiences and never lags in plot, storytelling, or animation is what makes this movie so great. Also this movie took 9 years to make. People have put their blood, sweat, and tears into it. I just wish it was more available on other platforms.",

            "review": "\"K-Pop Demon Hunters\" is a title that, right from the get-go, signals its target audience. For someone who isn't particularly fond of K-Pop, like myself, the premise alone was a bit of a hurdle. While I approached it with an open mind, the core theme proved to be a significant barrier to my enjoyment, making it clear that this movie just isn't for me. If you're not already a fan of the genre, or at least open to its aesthetics and musical style, you might find yourself in a similar boat.However, it's important to acknowledge where the production truly shines. The animation in \"K-Pop Demon Hunters\" is genuinely impressive. It's fluid, dynamic, and visually engaging, especially during action sequences. The character movements are well-executed, and the overall visual quality is high, indicating a strong effort in the animation department. Similarly, the voice acting is top-notch. The cast delivers their lines with conviction, bringing personality and emotion to their characters, which certainly elevates the dialogue and overall narrative delivery.Where the movie stumbles, in my opinion, is with its character design. While the animation itself is good, the designs of the characters often felt weird and didn't seem to reflect normal Koreans. This made it harder to connect with them on a visual level, which is a shame given the quality of the voice performances. A more relatable or thoughtfully varied approach to character aesthetics could have significantly enhanced the viewing experience.In conclusion, \"K-Pop Demon Hunters\" is a well-animated and well-voiced production that, unfortunately, struggles with unusual character designs and a thematic core that won't appeal to everyone. If you're a K-Pop enthusiast looking for a new animated movie, this might be right up your alley. But for those of us who don't resonate with the K-Pop genre, it's likely to be a miss, despite its technical merits.",

K-Pop Demon Hunters is a highly unique movie that takes the music genre and turn it into what's truly epic. From every minute of my viewing, I was stunned on how Sony Animation would make something that's one of their best since Spider-Verse. The story is highly intense, the animation is spectacular, the characters are all beloved, the songs bring the best moments, and the action are at their greatest. If you love K-Pop or just action movies in general, this is absolutely a must watch. And I'm sure that even non fans of K-Pop will definitely get hooked into this movie with all the epic moments and all the intensity this will have to offer. I am aware that K-Pop has been going popular from the past years. Based on my experience with this movie, I think I can start to understand why.

And I will say this movie is visually STUNNING like I love this movies art I can sit and stare at this movies for hours and hours. But when it comes to the other aspects it becomes underwhelming. The story is trying to do so much and every character has so much to them and there's a whole lot of lore and lessons but the movie is only an hour and 30 minutes it's no where near enough time to have all this and let it breath its way to packed in and it's just too much. Another issue being that the story feels super kiddie which yes it's a kid movie but like it has that talk down feeling that a lot of kids movies have. Like this movie said the word \"fan\" so many times it was insane like I get it they're idols they have fans it's important. Then also there's the acting. Some actors were amazing like Zoey's Actress specifically did absolutely amazing i specifically remember thinking she did great and her lines felt natural. But there were other characters who's lines felt super unnatural. But don't get me wrong visually everything is amazing I just wish there was more time to expand on what's there and give this movie room to breathe and if not that you need cut down on this lore.

It is horror, not because of the scary monsters or hidden nightmares, but because of the natural human unease towards bodies being bent and broken in ways they shouldn't. As a horror genre fan, I have become desensitized to most of the tactics used to scare in movies, but body horror, done right, never fails.Together is almost that movie. It builds anxiety both through body horror and simple awkwardness, but just as it rises to the point of being unbearable, it breaks the tension, either with humor or romance. It does this well, but I was left feeling too comfortable, too comfortable for a movie purporting to be a genre based on the opposite. If they had leaned into the body horror more, unwilling to break, this could've been exceptional, but as it stands, I was left wanting.For someone who is easily scared or is new to body horror, this film could be great. The humor and romance make it more approachable, but it also detracts from the horror. Certainly not a waste of time, but it sucks to see a film come so close only to miss the mark.",

The ending contains much ambiguity, which might not work for some. But I liked it. I think the film leaves a lot of room for interpretation about what happens. Whether the ending is happy or tragic, for example, is debatable, and even I feel that I could frame an argument for both sides.I found both of the leads - Alison Brie and Dave Franco - to be great. Their acting is smooth, and their characters are likable enough as protagonists. They have great romantic chemistry (some might respond by saying, \"Well duh, they're a real-life couple.\" But I've actually seen movies where real-life couples don't have on-screen chemistry; real-life relationships don't always translate on-screen. Both of them deserve credit for their performances in this movie).The movie is billed as a horror/comedy. And I guess there are some dialogue and embarassing situations that could be taken as comedy. But as a whole, I really found the movie to be more of a straight horror. And there are some creepy and unsettling moments. The gore is also not as extreme as I had heard. I never grimaced or felt the need to look away; there's no reliance on shock in this movie. The movie's pacing is good, and the run-time is just right.In terms of flaws -- the film introduces a friendly teacher at Alison Brie's job. The movie basically telegraphs that he knows more than he's letting on. There's a certain VHS scene that feels a little bit contrived; the film seems to jam that scene to explain stuff in as little time as possible. Additionally, I didn't quite grasp the backstory about Dave Franco's motherStill - a very good movie. It's not a knock-off, but this movie reminded me quite a lot of The Substance because of the general vibe (as well as a certain monster) .

A grotesque, clever, and oddly funny little gem that had me cringing, laughing, and totally hooked the entire time.The concept is unhinged in the best way: a couple moves to the countryside... and starts getting TOO attached. What unfolds is what I can best describe as a rom-com body horror (yes, really) that somehow makes co-dependency literal... and it weirdly works. So well.Body horror isn't for everyone, but this is so well done. The practical effects are gnarly in the best way - just the right amount of gross to make your stomach turn while keeping you glued to the screen. It leans into the absurdity, but underneath the chaos is a surprisingly honest look at toxic love, compromise, and identity.Alison Brie and Dave Franco are absolutely fantastic. You totally buy into them as a couple who love each other but maybe shouldn't be together. Or maybe should? I don't even know. That's part of the fun.And I have to say - any film shot in Melbourne gets an automatic bonus point from me. There's something so satisfying about seeing our suburbs twisted into something this surreal.Cringey in all the right ways. Disgusting in the best possible sense.

When the horror, tension, or weirdness finally shows up, it's good. But it doesn't stay there. It never really sits in the moment. More time should have been spent in those moments once they happened, not necessarily more things to happen. It felt like the film was holding back when it should've leaned in. More should've happened emotionally and visually. It felt like it could've gone deeper or darker, and I was ready for it. That's one of my big issues with the film. The body horror and supernatural elements are there, but they could've gone harder with it.The trailer gave away a lot, so if you've seen it, you've probably already caught most of the big horror moments. That takes away some of the surprise, which is a shame, because the film does have its own story to tell. It's straightforward and easy to follow.What worked really well was the emotional side of it. The relationship felt real. You could see yourself in these two people, and what they're going through feels honest. Dave Franco and Alison Brie are great together. You can tell they're a real couple. There's a natural chemistry between them that makes everything feel more believable, especially as things start to fall apart.

This isn't really helped by the fact that the \"twist\" is straight up spoiled by every piece of marketing material, despite the movie trying it's best to throw whatever doubt it can during the first act. When it actually gets into actually exploring the body horror, it becomes somewhat interesting again, with a healthy mix of genuine squeamishness and black comedy, although it's far from being the most graphic or disturbing offering in this subgenre.The acting is generally fine, but does get underminded by the script shoehorning in some of the most obvious foreshadowing of all time. I did find Dave Franco's performance the most amusing since he ends up whipping out a discount Jesse Pinkman voice towards the end of the film, whether that was intentional or not.While I ultimately didn't hate my experience with Together, I do think that most people will probably end up coming out of this film disappointed, especially due to the intense hype of this supposedly being \"the scariest movie of the year\".

It's as if they showed up just to cover the bills, not because they're invested in bringing anything special to the table. The performances, while competent, lack the energy and passion you'd expect from the cast. These are actors capable of so much more, but here, they seem like they're simply clocking in for a job rather than embracing a role.The film's script is a mess of clichés and missed opportunities, failing to deliver anything fresh or engaging. The dialogue is predictable, and the plot feels like it's been recycled from a dozen other films that did it better. There's an attempt to create emotional depth and connection between the characters, but it falls flat because the writing doesn't give them enough substance to make those moments feel earned. The pacing drags, and you're left waiting for a spark that never quite ignites.What Together truly feels like is a film made for actors who needed to stay relevant-or just needed the cash. It's a forgettable experience, and unfortunately, it's a reminder that even good actors can struggle when they're working with material that doesn't give them room to shine.There's no heart or soul here.

Although their offscreen bond doesn't necessarily blur into their characters, it inevitably hovers in the background. Mike Nichols' 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' wasn't simply a searing portrait of marital warfare; it was also Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, cinema's most famous spouses, sparring with a ferocity that audiences couldn't help but connect to their tempestuous private lives.Likewise, Stanley Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' wasn't just a puzzle about desire and fidelity. Echoed against the backdrop of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's highly publicized marriage, the couple's casting lent an extra layer of voyeuristic intrigue to the film. That extra-textual dimension doesn't alter the story, but it makes the fiction feel charged in ways it otherwise wouldn't.This is also the case with Michael Shanks' 'Together,' starring the real-life couple Dave Franco and Alison Brie. A body-horror à la Coralie Fargeat's 'The Substance,' the film follows long-time partners Tim and Millie, who have been drifting apart. After relocating to the countryside, they encounter a mysterious force that starts to reshape their lives, forcing them closer than ever. Soon, their romance becomes a macabre affair, as the boundaries between co-dependence and monstrosity irrevocably blur.Atmospheric, visceral and laced with dark humour, Shanks' film grips from start to finish. Essentially a Cronenbergian romantic comedy, it's bloody good fun, with some thematic weight. Shanks' narrative cleverly uses the language of body-horror to externalize the often-unspoken dynamics undermining relationships. More than an external threat, the disgusting entity that binds Tim and Millie embodies their neediness for, and resentment towards, one another.Horror has always excelled at making the abstract tangible- whether it be desire as parasite, or intimacy as contagion- and Shanks leans into that tradition with gory relish. In 'Together', the spectacle of skin and sinew isn't there for shock alone, but as a metaphor for how love can devour, how co-dependence can trap partners in a suffocating cycle of intimacy. As proceedings intensify, the couple's bond is forced into a crucible, revealing both the strength and fragility of their connection.Shanks' strong characterisation emphasises this point, especially when it comes to Tim. He is far from a traditional macho protagonist, being a vulnerable, tentative man marked by trauma. He can't work a compass or start a fire, and relies heavily on Millie in everyday situations. His hesitancy and fragility ground the film, making the couple's descent into grotesquerie more affecting than it otherwise might be.Millie, too, is drawn with nuance; a smart young teacher who loves Tim and wants the best for him, but whose patience sometimes frays under the weight of his insecurities. Together, they feel less like genre archetypes and more a realistic couple. Their exchanges throughout are natural, laced with a dry wit that feels true to life. At its core, the film is a love story, which works because one believes in Tim and Millie's bond- the tenderness beneath the terror.Visually, the film is as striking as it is unsettling. Germain McMicking's cinematography cloaks the rural setting in a pall of damp greys and muted greens, evoking both isolation and decay. Further, Nicholas Dare's production design makes the world feel intimate yet suffocating, deeply alive- disquietingly breathing.In addition, the effects work is impressively tactile, leaning on practical gore and prosthetics rather than CGI, giving things a raw, clammy immediacy. Shanks doesn't flinch from grotesque detail, yet the imagery never tips into gratuity. Just as crucial are the sound design and score: the former wringing dread from creaks, squelches and silences, the latter pulsing uneasily beneath the action without overwhelming it. Further, Sean Lahiff's editing is sharp and economical, ensuring every shock lands with precision.As Tim and Millie, Dave Franco and Alison Brie's real-life marriage lends their on-screen intimacy a raw authenticity, making Shanks' vision of closeness-turning-hideous even more disturbing. Both deliver powerhouse performances- Franco in particular, showing a vulnerability and range rarely glimpsed in his comedic work. Brie, meanwhile, plays Millie with a sharp mix of exasperation and tenderness, anchoring the film's emotional core. Damon Herriman also does fine work in a supporting role as Millie's work colleague Jamie, whose personable demeanour belies a hidden darkness.In conclusion, Michael Shanks' 'Together' is bloody great: a grisly reflection of intimacy, co-dependence and the messy realities of love. Dave Franco and Alison Brie work wonderfully together, grounding Shanks' Cronenbergian vision in something startlingly human. With tactile effects, evocative cinematography and a keen ear for dread, the film shows how passion can curdle into possession, with devastating consequences. In short, in the realm of body-horror, 'Together' stands apart.",

Fearing their power, Zeus split them into two separate parts, condemning them to spend their lives in search of their other halves.\" Plato, The SymposiumAlthough the current horror film Together doesn't pretend to parse Plato's discourse on love, it relies heavily on the idea that true love is the comingling of minds and bodies that were once separated by Zeus out of envy. Tim (David Franco) and Millie (Alison Brie) spend time in a country house seeking to regain the passion they once had.After a stroll that ends up in a cave (how very Platonic!), they devolve into maddened humans, literally getting under each other's skin. The visuals, even without excessive CGI, are body horror at its best, and allegorically land us in discussion about what love means and how it affects the struggling relationship the drama began with.Thematically Together wishes to show how much the stressed couple loves each other, even willing to sacrifice their very flesh to reconcile their affections. No couple in the audience can ignore the commentary on the emotional demands of love, the millennial fear of commitment, and the strains that modern lonely life make on romance.After all, Millie has sacrificed a higher teaching order to take a rural job while he is still at 35 years old trying to play in an indie-rock band. His intermittent impotency, while understandable given his lack of professional success, still seems like a major impediment to\ntaking their love to the next level.While treating the aud to some icky body horror, writer-director Michael Shanks comments on the challenges of modern living that needs the therapy of communal sharing, of overcoming horrors together to emerge from that cave together toward the future.",

But this takes it to another level. Everything they do is the worst thing they can do. They stand and watch, waiting to be killed. And they could do more if the movie didn't make up excuses for characters repeatedly not having a cell phone.This movie is absolute garbage. I had to hold back my laughter several times.

I grew up in the height of these teen slashers and I enjoyed them (also thinking of Urban Legend here). I knew they weren't great quality, and not critically acclaimed but I enjoyed them. They're like murder mysteries where you actually get to see the murders and have a go at guessing whodunnit.This new revival of IKWYDLS is almost exactly like watching the original when I was only 10, as a 37 year old. It is just plain silly fun with some glaring plot holes and daft decisions all round. I did guess who the culprit was early on but that didn't take away from the fun of being teased with the alternative motives. And we got to see some legendary 90s icons again which hits the nostalgia bell that the film knowingly mocks when Julie states \"nostalgia is overrated\". It even felt like the 90s in how little CGI and cinematography is used. It's fairly straightforwardly shot with one scene being an exception.This film isn't falling down in its silliness, it is self aware - it knows it isn't contributing to a quality film legacy (the original only has 5.8 on here, guys) and everyone should accept that it's never going to be oscar worthy.

Its a legacy sequel so yeah expect some nostalgia, however the script seemed very rush and the film suffered because of it.The connection between the original cast and the new generation was half-baked at best.

It has zero connection to the title. I kept waiting for something clever or satisfying, but all I got was a confused shrug in cinematic form.The plot twists? Hilariously bad. One after another, they trip over themselves trying to be edgy. It's like someone dared the writers to come up with the most ridiculous turns possible and then forgot to check if they actually fit into the story.What's worse is that they play it all completely straight, as if they're making a dark, serious thriller. Newsflash: when your horror movie starts feeling like unintentional parody, it's time to change genres. Honestly, they should've just embraced the mess and gone full-on horror comedy. At least then we'd be laughing with them instead of at them.Final word? Watch it if you're in the mood for a train wreck with delusions of depth.

It's hard to recreate that.But, somehow I Know What You Did Last Summer 2025 succeeded in every way.The cast are all sensational at making all the characters likeable in their own unique ways, the kills are brutal, the chase sequences are intense, and the over all mystery is a fun and enticing story that has the essence of the original, whilst not being a direct copy and paste.The biggest stand out of the film is that it is unpredictable. With so many 'slashers' remakes and stand alone films made over the past 25 years, it is hard to make sequences unpredictable and unique. But the film does an incredible job of making you think you know what's going to happen, but then goes in a completely different direction.Obviously we have to talk about the return of Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr). After watching the trailers, most people would admit that going in to the film, they didn't expect much screen time for the legacy cast. Once again, it was unpredictable, as Julie and Ray become a part of the story and have a surprising amount of screen time, and relevance to the over all plot. Jennifer Love Hewitt is an outstanding performer, proven by her very successful career. However, one small critique would be that the script didn't quite capture the essence of Julie James. But, Jennifer Love Hewitt does her best at bringing back the loveable final girl and by the end of the film it feels like Julie is on the screen, not Jennifer.It is hard to find big faults in the film, and there are only minor flaws that could have elevated the films intensity to a higher level. A few major sequences and the films climax takes place during the day. If these scenes had taken place at night, the darkness, the mystery of not being able to see everything would have made a huge impact on those scenes and the climax. All fans remember the terrifying chase sequence of Helen Shivers (Sarah Michelle Gallar) where she is being hunted by Ben Willis (Muse Watson), in his slicker with his iconic hook, across the quiet streets of Southport. Fans also remember the horror of Julie and Ray being secluded in the dark on the killers boat surrounded by black water, with nothing insight to help. The scenes in this 2025 film could have elevated the ferocity by having the isolation in the dark atmosphere that was so successful in the two original films.The only other critique would be that the ending was unnecessarily extended. Without spoilers, there are three scenes after the climax, two of those scenes seemed out of place and completely pointless, leaving the ending of the film to be bizarre and unemotional. The credits roll and suddenly we're met with a mid-credit scene. It was a strange choice by the director to have a mid-credit scene that was undoubtedly one of the most exciting fan service scenes of the film that sets up a potential sequel. Instead of the underwhelming ending with the main cast, the mid-credit scene should have been the ending of the film. If they cut the useless additional scenes and had the mid-credit scene as the ending, the film wouldn't just have a satisfying ending, it would have gone out with a bang, leaving audiences excited about the possibility of a sequel.Overall it's hard to find big faults, so with those minor details that could have taken the film up a level, I rate it as 9/10. The film is fun, intense and captures the essence of the original I Know What You Did Last Summer.",

            "review": "I really wanted to like this movie, and it hurts to say that it is actually very mid. It tries to be extremely high-stakes but forgets what made the best mission films so great-not only the action but also the characters. It's hard not to see that the plot is there just to fill the time between the key stunts. But I'd like to go into more detail, starting with what I liked.1. Cinematography and action. As usual, the cinematography is strong with this one. Some of the shots were jaw-dropping, hands down. The submarine underwater sequence is a masterclass in tension. I forgot all the problems I had with the plot while watching it. Truly beautiful. No matter the issues that I will list further, I still have a crazy respect for Tom Cruise doing this for real and bringing the best action possible.2. Benji. I absolutely love everything they did with this character. From being a nameless computer guy, to Ethan's close friend and partner, to actually becoming a co-leader with Ethan. Definitely well built and deserved.3. Some connections with previous movies felt nice; one even had a great message behind it. Though I have to say, it felt like the creators didn't trust the audience enough to recognise them. For example, when one of the characters was brought back from another M:I, Benji immediately started explaining who this guy was, which killed some of the joy for me, as a fan.But, even if I wouldn't call TFR a bad movie, it is a very flawed one.1. The whole \"CHOICE\" situation is stupid. It's never once foreshadowed in any of the first six movies, so it feels like a retcon. Why was this even needed? It brings nothing to the story apart from Grace joining the team, which could've been done in a dozen other ways.2. This movie has some of the heaviest exposition I've ever seen. It felt dragged a lot of times. Not Andor-slow, rather just dragged and pointless. Characters explain things all the time, repeating and finishing each other's sentences. And even with so much info being said, it still sometimes gets unclear who the villain is or what motivation/goals they have.3. We learn NOTHING about the Gabriel-Ethan relationship, which was teased so much in Part 1. Honestly, in the end, if Entity chose any other guy and not the one who happens to be Ethan's old enemy, nothing would've changed. Like absolutely nothing. What was the point of those flashbacks in Part 1? We have no idea what the situation was, who that woman was, why Gabriel killed her, or why Ethan was framed for it. It brings nothing new to Ethan's character. Also, Gabriel himself is boring. We know nothing about him, and if in theory, this could've been intimidating, in practice, it just makes him a poorly written villain. Why establish a detailed background and motivation for a character if we can just throw in the same flashback here and there and make Ethan panic when he sees him the first time in DR :) (I am not saying this franchise always had nuanced villains. It's an action blockbuster of all things. But Gabriel is just rock bottom.)4. Final fight with Gabriel didn't feel earned or satisfying, because Gabriel is probably one of the most passive villains I've ever seen. He makes some bald statements and runs away the whole movie. And when he finally gets defeated, the scene itself is straight out of the comedy genre, in a film that otherwise tries to be obnoxiously serious.5. Villains in this movie generally take minimal conscious action, so they do not feel intimidating or engaging. This is especially true of AI. It is hard to be afraid of it. AI enemy sounds cool on paper, but it doesn't really fit in Mission's formula. My concerns from watching DR were proven true. In the end, all we got was a race for an ultra-tech macguffin, which has to connect to other macguffin, which can be found by using another macguffin, only then to use the final macguffin at the right timing to defeat the Entity. Sounds stupid and boring? It is. That is the price for having the enemy you can't see in the media, where everything is based on seeing.6. Yes, some villains from other iterations might not have been top-level, but at least the characters around Ethan made the movie engaging. This brings us to secondary characters in this movie. Paris... Pom Klementieff did a great job, but she did not have a lot to work with, unfortunately. We do not learn anything new about her. I really wanted to see her character developed in this movie, but it's just a sad mess, honestly.7. Same goes for Degas. He showed signs of conscience, joined Ethan to save the world, and then completely disappeared from the plot.8. There is just too many side characters, especially in the government and military. Most of them don't even have names. They are just plot vessels, not actual people.9. Lite spoiler: In the film's first minutes, you get a montage of key moments from previous entries. That looked peak in the trailer, but watching it again in the actual movie felt very cheesy. I felt like watching a fan edit on TikTok, not a Hollywood blockbuster.10. That ending... Probably the worst Mission ending ever. Extremely cliche and lacks emotion. I can't believe this is all they came up with, especially considering this is supposed to be the ending of a 30-year-long journey.11. Probably the weakest soundtrack we got since MI3. Not a musician, so I won't be commenting on this, but subjectively it is definitely not as consistent and emotional as previous ones.For me, this movie can be best described by my favourite quote from Arcane. In pursuit of the highest stakes possible, more characters than ever, and the longest, most extreme stunts, they failed to deliver the characters that make the audience care, stunts that feel natural inside the plot, and a villain who is actually intimidating.",

Sorry, but that's just not good writing - it's exposition dumping.The rest is basically run-of-the-mill action sequences and plot devices that lead to a pretty predictable and not-very-exciting plot.

When the credit rolled I had nothing but respect for the makers, for the entire team, not just of this movie but for every movie since MI 1996.Overall, it might not top Mission Impossible Fallout but it will stay equally memorable to me. It did its job well which is to conclude the franchise in a spectacular way, without going over the top with action (think of Fast and Furious franchise).I surely liked it better than Dead Reckoning because there were more of likeable characters rather than annoying characters. It was like a bunch of good people coming together to fight a noble cause, something that was missing in the previous movie. Some people might find some of the scenes being too lengthy but I didn't mind all of the hard work being played a little longer than required. Watching Tom Cruise giving it his all was once again as thrilling as it was 25 (or so) years ago.As the movie said: our lives are the sum of our choices. Watching this movie was one of the best choice I ever made. So, if you are an MI fan don't miss this in cinema. It's going to be memorable, it's going to be epic!",

In fact from the moment I sat in my seat I was at the cinema for over 3 hours. But it never felt like that.The climax with the bi-planes was superb and one of the best and most exciting action scenes I've ever seen.For me, this was one of the best Mission Impossible films. Loved it. Have no idea why some of the critics have panned it. Then again what do they know? It's all about having fun on the big screen and this is exactly what Tom Cruise does best. He's an absolute master in it. Highly recommend!",

            "review": "Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning serves as the grandest and boldest farewell to arguably the greatest action franchise of all time. Yet, it lacks a true sense of finality.The film shoulders a colossal burden, attempting to deliver a worthy goodbye to Ethan Hunt and the iconic franchise. It aims to provide satisfying conclusions to a bloated roster of side characters while also setting up inevitable cash-grab sequels. Additionally, it strives to outdo every previous installment by going bigger and bolder than ever. While it excels in some areas, it falters in others.One of the film's biggest challenges is managing its vast ensemble of characters. The script occasionally struggles to balance them all, resulting in scenes where some characters randomly appear and disappear, seemingly out of convenience rather than logic. This inconsistency can be jarring, pulling the audience out of the experience.In typical Mission Impossible fashion, the film promises the most spectacular set pieces yet-and it delivers. These grand, meticulously crafted action sequences are thrilling to watch. However, their constant back-to-back presence somewhat dampens their impact. Once the audience becomes accustomed to the relentless spectacle, the element of surprise and tension starts to wane.The stunts, while still impressive, carry a bittersweet note. Unlike previous installments where Tom Cruise's daring feats were fully captured on camera, this time around, roughly half of the action scenes rely on noticeable green screen effects. Though understandable, given Cruise's age and safety precautions, it slightly detracts from the visceral thrill of witnessing genuine stunts, making the danger feel less real.Performance-wise, this installment shines, particularly with Angela Bassett delivering one of the most emotionally charged portrayals in the franchise. The script's emphasis on deeper emotions allows for some of the finest acting moments in the series.However, the editing feels somewhat sloppy, giving the impression that substantial material was left on the cutting room floor. While the brisk pacing keeps the film engaging, it sometimes feels as if we're only witnessing the start and end of scenes without the journey in between, leaving a sense of incompleteness. The cutting is fast, but not in an exhilarating manner-instead, it's disorienting.If this truly is the final goodbye to the Mission Impossible series, it's been an unforgettable ride. Despite its flaws, the franchise remains the pinnacle of action cinema in my book, and its legacy will undoubtedly endure for generations. I've said this before, and I'll say it again: we are witnessing a master at craft. Cherish it while you can.This message will self-destruct in five seconds.",

            "review": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is a bit of a disappointment, coming off the particularly high highs of Fallout and Dead Reckoning. The stakes are heightened narratively, with the end of the world being imminent throughout, but you don't often feel the desperation; you're mostly just told about it. And that's one of the things that holds this film back. It's so weighed down in exposition and dialogue scenes that aren't necessarily that much worse than such scenes in the other films in the series, but they're inferior enough that they start to drag. And there's not enough action here, which feels weird to say. There needed to be one more set piece, preferably during the first hour, because this is a long movie and the first hour or more is honestly a bit dull. The funny banter was also much less funny, when they even attempted humor. It's kind of a dour movie, which makes sense with the stakes, but also, I didn't really feel those stakes. So I would've rather just had that usual breezy team chemistry and joke-making.Speaking of stakes and showing things, I would've loved a set piece in a populated area? Or an action scene that felt more alive/crowded/in a place that felt real. In The Final Reckoning, there's an extended one with Cruise alone, one near the end (and on some of the posters for the film) involving some small planes, and then a handful of small shootouts and fist fights. There's nothing that's as big or as exciting as the whole train sequence in Dead Reckoning, and that film had some city action (plus a great car chase) and the whole airport scene. It's fresher in my mind than The Final Reckoning, even though I saw one two years ago and the other two hours ago. There's more tension and a feeling of danger when you can see civilization and bystanders, I think. And with everyone in the world being in danger because of the plot, it was weird to feel like no one (other than the main heroes and villains) was in danger during the action scenes.The finale of this movie is smaller scale, but that sequence is a knockout. It's almost worth the price of admission, but you do have to slog through some dreary stuff beforehand. The end of the world is nigh, but mostly you just hear about it, or some high-ranking government officials discuss things in board/bored rooms (and some of those scenes feel like if they were pushed into territory that was any more over-dramatic, we'd have Dr. Strangelove-esque comedy).The more I think about it, the more I realize this was kind of disappointing, even if I really loved the one big action scene that will, eventually, be the only thing I remember about this. I'm torn between like a 3/5 or a 3.5/5, and think I have to go more toward the former, just because this is too long for something with so little action. It needed to show more of the world, and we needed at least one sequence with more people and things in it. I feel like Dead Reckoning had about two or three times more great action than this, and the same can be said about Fallout. Dead Reckoning was a few minutes shorter, and Fallout was like half an hour shorter. Neither cost as much, but both felt more expensive. More bang for your buck watching those, and fewer bucks spent by the filmmakers to make them. The Final Reckoning feels pretty expensive, but not $300-400 million expensive.They got a little lazy with The Final Reckoning. They didn't get lazy in the couple of particularly flashy scenes, but they needed more big scenes and they shouldn't have had the film feel so empty. Too much telling, not enough showing. The lack of a consistent villain throughout hurt - Gabriel was a compelling presence in Dead Reckoning, but he's not in this one as much, disappearing for long stretches at a time.The Final Reckoning comes alive in parts. The plane stuff is thrilling. 90% of the movie, or maybe even a little more, fluctuates between being a tiny bit disappointing and very disappointing. I guess overall, I'm quite disappointed they couldn't keep the momentum going; these films had just kept getting better, from the second onwards, but no more.This really will be the Final one, I Reckon. Can't see it turning a profit, either.",

            "review": "I'm going to sound negative because to be honest i expected a lot more from this movie.First of all the dialogue was unusually poor, i know that's not what the movie is for but it's noticeable and it broke the immersion for me. The beginning felt like an introduction, which might be necessary for first time mission impossible viewers, though quite repetitive for those who have seen Dead Reckoning. The flashbacks and flashforwards to explain the story was a lazy choice in my opinion and it was one the big negatives in this film. The whole story is constantly being explained leaving no room for mystery, some intrigue or some unpredictable moments. Actually it becomes almost annoying because the dialogue is just sloppy, leaving very little for the actors to work with. Fortunately some momentum is gained as the movie progresses, mainly from the stunts which are absolutely incredible and let's be honest, you probably won't find anything that comes close in any other type of media. Though this momentum doesn't last long because of all the explaining again and the bad guys seeming to be there only for show. What I'm trying to say is that Yes the action sequences are obviously the main selling point of MI but not the only one. An interesting story that keeps its viewers guessing is what separates an OK MI from a great MI. I don't know, maybe they messed up the editing? I think the writing was a problem, the whole thing seemed rushed.I think i will just rewatch Fallout to feel good.",

In comparison, Final Reckoning feels more like a test of the audience's patience-much like the first installment. The direction leans heavily on overused, unnecessarily zoomed-in angled shots that come off as anything but cinematic. The dialogue is average at best, and the excessive explanation of every plot point treats the audience as if they can't keep up.The editing also falls short, several shots feel disconnected, breaking the flow. The background score doesn't help either; it lacks impact and often feels mismatched. The sudden shift to \"you're humanity's last hope\" and the repetitive use of words like \"entity\" weaken the script. The writing lacks subtlety and starts to feel forced. The only standout sequence is the James Cameron-esque 20-minute underwater scene, which is genuinely breathtaking.It's a letdown that there's no signature BMW chase. As always, Tom Cruise and his commitment to fitness remain legendary.",

            "review": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is bombastic to put it mildly, given all the fast-paced exposition and visually resounding action setpieces.While after the Hitchcockian narrative of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, this concluding chapter somewhat may feel a bit inadequate - especially with all those lots of scenes in caves and lairs and prisons with no astoundingly risky turn - the highs are even higher than the lows seem lower. Let me tell you, everyone will be googling \"Mission Impossible 8 submarine scene\" a week for now.The underwater chapter is indeed breathtaking and quite original piece of filmmaking and a nice addition to M:I franchise which saves the movie big time. That 20-minute sequence with submarine is perhaps the most original piece of action written for action-oriented narratives since 1996's Mission: Impossible's own aqua cafe sequence between Ethan and Kittdridge, directed brilliantly by Brian De Palma. The suspense as Ethan so assiduously tackled all those aquatic, James Cameron-isque challanges was palpable. The realism and authenticity added the rest.Else, they have recycled tropes all over the place in order to pay homage - the gala which is rendered into a jail before the gathering itself is even exhibited - no fancy cars, garish costumes, stupendous decorum, dances, masks, bluetooth talk, etc. In here. I missed the trains as well.And narratively, there also exists this thing called predictability, and it's here to stay in the movie - the biggest weakness of The Final Reckoning. The movie is, perhaps, the least memorable for its twists - or the lack thereof - when compared to all the other M:I movies in the franchise, probably tied with Mission: Impossible 2. But that's not to say it is bad, or average or even above average - no! It's hella great!!In terms of action-based storytelling as well, this may seem like a step backwards from Mission: Impossible - Fallout. Most scenes, when considering the movie is nearly 3 hours long, is quite limited or superfluous otherwise. But all of that pays off in the final act, trust Mr. Cruise. Because that brings us to the biplane chase sequence.After 150 minutes of absolutely no motorcycles and cars chasing each other, though plenty of Cruise sprinting, the red and yellow old-school biplanes going after each other in South African skies is something that should adequately feed all the ravenous audiences. It's suspenseful, it's engaging, it's REALLY dangerous; though the villainous Gabriel character is still bland and bad, like the previous entry.The diversity, without throwing into our faces what their genders are, is probably the quintessential example of how these things should be done. Hannah Waddingham in charge of aircraft carrier was something that really paid off. I didn't like the \"lady boy\" person wearing that vest and donning horrible hairstyle in that submarine. Angela Bassett seemed a natural as a president and didn't feel forced to assume a masculine aura just because she's a female US President. Thanks to all the brilliant women in the movie to forsake that awful cliché line \"you don't think a woman can do it\" - you show them subtly rather than preaching non-stop about such superfluous substance like in some Marvel movie.Overall, a decent enough Mission: Impossible movie but a brilliant actioner, nonetheless, given how the series has always fared when compared by Hollywood's standards.

The Final Reckoning has its limitations and odd dramatic fixations, but it holds together as a massive cinematic experience filled with exhilarating, nail-biting, armrest-grabbing tension. Cementing its place as one of cinema's most consistent franchises, the film's breathtaking scale and death-defying stunts make for a blockbuster masterclass. Continuing Cruise and McQuarrie's intrepid crusade against the rising use of AI, it's hard not to enjoy the duo at home in their element, delivering yet more jaw-dropping stunts and globe-trotting adventure, overflowing with overly complex plot and escalating complication upon complication. In many ways, this is less an action film and more a disaster flick. Where worst-case scenarios were once implied, they are now visualised with apocalyptic projections. Gargantuan in action, runtime, and scope, The Final Recokoning completely embraces its grandiose nonsense. It acknowledges itself as huge, fun, silly, and emotionally rewarding, never attempting to restrain its exuberance, and we love it for that. A sentimental sendoff that accomplishes its mission with a characteristic flair for the impossible. Ethan can rest easy now. Mission accomplished Tom.",

            "review": "This is just a bad movie, and easily the worst of the franchise. I have no idea how it is being rated so highly on average.I kid you not, the first 60-90 minutes of this are mostly exposition dumps with minimal action. And the dialogue is so absurdly profound, I felt like any minute Leslie Nielsen would pop his head into the scene and say \"We're all counting on you\", like in Airplane. It baffles the mind how a movie this expensive to make, has so bad writing. That's when it's actually dialogue. More often than not it's a monologue about how the fate of the world hangs in the balance only Tom Cruise's character can save itAnd this is a theme throughout the whole movie. It is at great pains to remind us that only Tom Cruise's character can save the world. More than any previous Mission Impossible movie, this is unambiguously the Tom Cruise show. It feels like he is in every scene and they all revolve around how important he is. At one point, he actually gets told, and I quote verbatim: \"You Are The Chosen One\". Any other movie, that would have been the setup to a wisecrack, or the character being teased about it throughout the rest of the movie. In this one, it gets taken seriously! Mission Impossible used to be about the team coming together to enact a ludicrous plan to save the day. Not anymore. This movie elevates Ethan Hawke to godlike status with everybody else basically playing a glorified extra who should be thankful if they occasionally get shown on screen.But the biggest sin this movie commits, is that it's boring. These are meant to be fun action movies. But at a near three hour runtime, the action scenes are far and few in between. Most of the time the movie feels more interested in trying to get us to be sad that it's meant to be Tom Cruise's final Mission Impossible movie and forgets it's actually meant to be entertaining us.",

            "review": "This is easily one of the most anticipated films of the year-and for good reason. After nearly 30 years of explosive action, daring stunts, and intricate spy plots, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning may just be the final chapter in Ethan Hunt's legendary journey. And if it truly is the end, then what a powerful and heartfelt send-off it is.While it might not have the jaw-dropping, death-defying moment like the motorcycle jump off a cliff from Dead Reckoning Part 1-performed by Tom Cruise himself-The Final Reckoning delivers in other, equally meaningful ways. The story is packed with callbacks to previous Mission: Impossible films, cleverly weaving together a narrative that pays tribute to its roots. The return of William Donloe and flashes of Ethan from the early days (when Cruise was just 33) to now, at nearly 63, serve as a powerful reflection of time, dedication, and transformation.Amazingly, Tom Cruise still moves with the energy and intensity of someone half his age. His iconic sprint scenes are as thrilling as ever, and his commitment to physical performance continues to impress. Sure, the plot-like most spy thrillers-requires some suspension of disbelief. The odds are often impossibly small. But honestly? I didn't care. I was thoroughly entertained.Beyond the action, what stood out was the emotional depth. We see just how much Ethan cares for his team. The bond they share feels more like a family than a crew. The loss of Ilsa is heartbreaking, but it's handled with grace, and it adds real emotional weight. There are also moments of intelligent humor that bring lightness to the tension, making the 2-hour 49-minute runtime feel surprisingly brisk.The franchise began by staying close to its TV roots, where every member of the team had a special skill and no one outshined the others. At times, that format felt a little flat. But as the films evolved, so did the characters-and the emotional stakes. The introduction of Ethan's wife in Fallout added a new layer of humanity, and in this film, the emergence of new faces makes you wonder if a new team could one day carry on the legacy-even without Ethan.All in all, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is a phenomenal conclusion to one of the greatest action franchises of all time. It's thrilling, emotional, and packed with everything fans have come to love. If this really is the end, then they've ended it in the best possible way.",

And for me it does not work.Bringing back ground characters back from previous MI movies, who cares?! Tying the entity to what we saw in MI3. Why? We already had the setup in Dead Reckoning? Why make it any more complicated?!None of the epic / surprise set pieces such as the Kremlin bombing in Ghost Protocol are here. It very much needed something in the first 90 minutes, such as a nuke going off. Instead we are just told what the threat is and it goes on and on.No Masks, no Ethan completely surprisingly outsmarting the bad guy. It needed something epic, which I was expecting (Ethan had to outsmart the Entity and be a step ahead according to Luther!) For example Elsa could have surprisingly made it and just faked her death or so (in the party club scene in DR we saw Gabriel knives - I thought Ethan may have swapped them for dummy ones or so, the tools were there to do this).I'm not sure what they were thinking with this one.A real shame.

            "review": "There are some actors who do not just play a role. They live it. They breathe it. They are it. And Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt is exactly that. Watching The Final Reckoning feels like sitting in a dark room filled with decades of memories, missions, betrayals, and near-death experiences and quietly realizing it might be the last time we see this man sprint toward danger for our entertainment. If this really is the end, then what a journey it has been.This film is not just about espionage, global threats, or saving the world. At its very core, it is a cinematic love letter to Tom Cruise. From the very first shot, the camera practically worships him. And honestly, we do too. He is Mission: Impossible. It's almost as if the film pauses just long enough to let us appreciate the legacy he's built. The real bruises, the real fear in his eyes, the real wind slamming against his face thousands of feet in the air. When they say he does his own stunts, this movie is the ultimate proof of that.There's one sequence, a 20-minute spectacle involving planes, that had us gripping the edge of our seats. Not because it was over-the-top, but because it felt so damn real. The positioning of the cameras, the roaring sound of the engines, the barely visible tremble in Ethan's muscles. All of it screams authenticity. You could feel the gravity. You could feel the weight. And you could tell Cruise was putting every drop of himself into it. It is art through adrenaline.But The Final Reckoning is not perfect. And maybe it was never meant to be.This installment chooses not to waste time diving into backstories or emotional flashbacks. It is mission first, emotions later. And while that does keep the pace laser-focused for the most part, it also comes with a cost. Some fans may feel like the heart, the soul, the \"why should I care?\" moments, are few and far between. At times, it feels like the movie is sprinting only toward its mission goal that it forgets everything else.What we admire, though, is how The Final Reckoning ties itself beautifully to the past. It is not trying to create a brand new mission. It is not throwing a bunch of new characters into the mix. It is solving what Dead Reckoning left behind, and in doing so, it loops itself tightly around the other past six films. It closes loops. It answers questions. It brings emotional closure to threads that have been hanging for years. There's a certain bravery in doing that, of focusing on one mission and choosing not to open new doors just for the sake of future films.And then there's the villain. This antagonist is not just a bad guy, he is intangible. He is near God-like. The stakes are sky-high. It genuinely feels impossible. Like, actually impossible. It puts Ethan and his team in a corner where every second counts. Time is running out. Stake is at all-time high. It is everything we want in a Mission: Impossible film. It dares to make us believe the heroes may not win this time. That someone might not make it out alive.Here's where the main issue lies; this final installment felt very long-winded. It feels like it wants to tell you everything. It seems like it takes itself seriously... way too seriously even. It really does feel like it makes itself looks complex much more than what it is and what it's supposed to be.Some scenes also stretched out very long, like they wanted audience to listen to every word or watch at every action that took place. The pacing is very slow. One scene can go up to 7-8 minutes of what could have been cut to just about 3-4 minutes. It wants it to be very detailed but here's the thing. It's dour. It can be a bit dull. And because of that, some audience may lost interest in the movie. It gives you a lot of expositions that can feel too much for some especially if you're not that invested with the franchise or if you've forgotten a lot of details from the previous movies.There is also an underwater sequence teased in the trailers that promises something epic. And visually, it delivers. But emotionally and logically? It breaks the very rules this franchise has set up for years. This is the first time it felt like the story needed Cruise to have a bit of CGI help. A bit of plot armor. And that hurts. Because we know he is capable of doing the impossible. But here, it feels like the movie cheated its way to impress the audience. And that matters to us.And yes, the tone itself is gritty. It wants to be raw. It wants to be as realistic as it can. It wants the audience to immerse itself with Ethan Hunt to complete this final mission. Some may get into it. Some others may just feel tedious waiting for the next scene to happen. But here's one thing they forget; with all the grittiness that lies, it forgets to be entertaining for the mass market. The entertainment value in this is lacking for general audience. Everything that's entertaining with Fallout was almost devoid here. What made Fallout great was even with all the grittiness and the grainy tone, its entertainment value is top notch and high octane. It knows its target audience, it has the right balance of action, comedy, drama and romance. But The Final Reckoning forgets that part. Just serious faces doing serious things for almost 3 hours. The film forgets how to have fun. It forgets that people come to be thrilled and entertained. And that lack of balance makes the ride feel a little heavier than it should be.And finally, the ending. Is it satisfying? In some ways, yes. It gives us closure. It gives us enough to walk away with peace. But is it great? That's debatable. It could have used more 'heart'. It could have reached deeper. It ends with the feeling that maybe, just maybe, we're not actually done. That there might be more in the vault. And in today's Hollywood with reboots and sequels era, that's not hard to believe.Verdict: This one takes itself seriously. Way too seriously. It drowns in exposition, stretches scenes beyond their breaking point, and forgets that people came here to feel alive, not just overwhelmed. It forgets to breathe. It forgets to have fun. But maybe that's the point. The Final Reckoning is a heavy, brooding farewell that wants to honor Ethan Hunt and Tom Cruise with the gravitas of a cinematic eulogy. Because this feels like the last time we'll see him this raw, this real. His 20-minute plane sequence alone is worth the ticket. If this really is the end, The Final Reckoning isn't flawless but it is fearless. Thank you, Tom Cruise.",

            "review": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning attempts to blend high-octane action with modern anxieties about artificial intelligence, but the result is a hollow, bloated film that mistakes noise for substance and spectacle for storytelling.At its core, this is a movie that doesn't understand the subject it tries to tackle. The portrayal of AI is laughably vague and rooted in outdated clichés-clearly written by someone whose grasp of modern technology is, at best, superficial. It reduces complex systems to buzzwords and omnipotent digital forces that defy any kind of internal logic. The film treats AI as both all-powerful and conveniently fallible, depending entirely on what the script demands at any given moment.The action sequences-once the defining strength of the franchise-have become formulaic. Tom Cruise runs. Tom Cruise clings to moving vehicles. Tom Cruise survives the impossible. These moments, once exhilarating, now feel obligatory. Each set piece is dragged out far too long, escalating beyond reason until tension gives way to fatigue. The repetition dulls their impact, and without meaningful stakes, it's hard to care. The inevitability of the heroes' survival robs every confrontation of suspense.Worse, the film seems uninterested in narrative coherence or emotional depth. Character development is non-existent, and most interactions feel like placeholders between the next explosion or high-speed maneuver. The plot, thin and implausible, serves only as scaffolding for increasingly improbable action. There's no real arc-just a steady drumbeat of louder, faster, and more until the credits roll.Ultimately, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is a film trapped in its own delusions of grandeur. It clings to outdated storytelling methods, relying on spectacle to mask its lack of substance. It may satisfy those looking for three hours of escapism, but for anyone expecting a meaningful evolution of the franchise-or a competent exploration of contemporary themes-this movie offers little more than disappointment.",

There are a lot of characters from the past that being brought back naturally, which I feel is a nice touch. It serves their purpose and doesn't feel out of place or forced. However, not all are to my liking - the twist wasn't as impressive as previous movies and the plot felt a bit linear and thin. It's almost 3 hours so I feels like a road trip rather than a roller coaster. Despite this, I enjoyed the ride and it reminded me of what MI is really about: \"We live and die in the shadows, for those we hold close, and those we never meet.\"",

But the bigger problem is the so-called story - or rather, the absence of one. There is no real plot to hold the film together, and attempts at both drama and comedy fall flat.To make things worse, Param Sundari shamelessly borrows from better films - a dash of Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania, a slice of 2 States, shades of Chennai Express, and the eternal template of DDLJ. But instead of paying homage, it ends up as a poor patchwork that only reminds the audience of how much better those originals were.In short, Param Sundari is a tired rehash with no soul, no spark, and no originality - just another disaster in the making.",

From the trailers and promotions, the movie sets high expectations of glamour, energy, and drama. Unfortunately, when the actual film unfolds, it quickly becomes clear that this is more style than substance, and watching it feels like a wasted investment of time.The biggest problem with Param Sundari lies in its writing. The story never really takes off; it meanders endlessly without a proper direction or emotional core. Instead of giving audiences a gripping narrative or memorable characters, the screenplay jumps from one unnecessary scene to another. This makes the film drag unnecessarily, testing the patience of viewers. Even the dramatic moments fail to strike a chord because the execution is shallow and predictable.The performances don't do much to salvage the experience either. Despite a talented cast, the characters lack depth and originality. Most of the actors appear to be going through the motions rather than breathing life into their roles. As a result, the audience struggles to connect with them on any meaningful level.Music and dance numbers, which could have been the saving grace, also turn out to be disappointing. Instead of enhancing the mood of the film, they feel inserted just for glamour and filler, leaving no lasting impression.Visually, the movie tries hard with costumes, sets, and camera work, but even that can't hide the lack of substance underneath. When the audience is left admiring only the surface beauty without caring about the story, the purpose of cinema is lost.In the end, Param Sundari is not entertaining, inspiring, or engaging.

Nothing-absolutely nothing-is funny in this unoriginal film. Everything-absolutely everything-seems forced and contrived and isn't authentic or at all believable. The cast is poorly chosen, in my opinion, and since \"series Simmons\" couldn't bring out the best in the two main protagonists, both shine with a somewhat cringeworthy overacting that actually does some justice to the very annoying and unsympathetic characters.Judging by the trailer, I was at least hoping the car chases might be good, but oh man, that backfired massively. The car chase scenes consist of a weird, perspective-based editing mess that leaves you completely disoriented. The camerawork lacks the skill to make the production's low budget look good and exciting. I also have no idea what's so interesting about the many close-ups of \"Samara Weaving\" and her frozen face. She plays her role so poorly throughout anyway that I would have loved to see a fly fly into her constantly half-open mouth; that would have been really funny.I can't say much about \"Karl Glusman,\" who is unknown to me and blessed with the charisma of a road worker and plays the ex-boyfriend, because he's so charismatically bland. The only bright spot is Andy Garcia, who solidly gets his paycheck here.

She holds the movie together brilliantly with heart and logic while the madness unfolds around her, yet shows a genuine toughness missing from so many female characters written today - due to them simply being 'female versions' of the male characters that came before them (mainly aimed at superhero movies).This movie is well written, excellently directed and superbly acted by all involved. It's instantly rewatchable and will definitely go down as a cult classic if nothing else.There's no doubt we are in one of the worst periods of film history with the rubbish that's been churned out over the past five years, but i can honestly say i was entertained, amused, excited and impressed by everything and everyone involved in this film.

I wasn't preached at, signaled at what the correct world view I was supposed to have, or even tried to impress me with masterful writing or directing. If I was rating this movie in an earlier year, I would probably rate it lower. But with absolute unwatchable garage getting 7-8 ratings, this easily scores as a 7 in my book.This is like a low-effort version of 'Crank' - less action, more 'vibe'. If you aren't in the mood for that vibe, it might rub you the wrong way. Decent enough car scenes to be entertaining, decent enough acting to sell the casual 'what did I do?' vibe, and chaotic enough to entertain.",

I also enjoyed the supporting cast with Karl Glusman, Steve Zahn, Andy Garcia, Randall Park, Marshawn Lynch, Mike O'Malley, Kyanna Simone, Jermaine Fowler and Chris Bauer. The plot of the movie is very simple and easy to follow, so I was invested in what was going to happen. You get some solid enough chase and action sequences throughout the movie that are well shot. And finally, the movie has a quick pace to keep the audience invested in the story.Negatives for Eenie Meanie (2025):\nThe movie's premise is one that I've seen many times in other movies and done much better. Aside from Samara Weaving, the supporting characters are whatever and I only remember them because of the actors playing them. There is nothing new here and it feels like the director watched a couple of movies with similar premises and decided to make the same movie. And finally, this movie was very clearly made by a first-time filmmaker as this is a movie that could've been made by literally anyone.Overall, Eenie Meanie (2025) is an okay and fun heist thriller movie with a fun cast and I am curious to see what the writer-director of this movie does next because this movie was literally a copy and paste of other movies that I've seen. If you need some background noise for other things, then this movie is one I would recommend for that task.",

Everything is absurdly stupid - from the script to the characters' behavior.There's hardly any plot to speak of. Instead of a coherent story, we get a pathetic excuse for intrigue - something about \"collecting blood samples.\" The rest is just empty space, disconnected scenes, and aimless noise. It feels like the writers just gave up, hoping that big names and dinosaurs would carry the film.But even the dinosaurs are missing. What we get instead are grotesque mutant creatures that inspire neither fear nor awe - only disgust. Where's the grandeur of the ancient world? Where's the spirit of adventure? Everything is drowned in a CGI mess.And let's not forget the behavior of the main characters. It's not just stupid - it's insulting. It feels like they're competing to see who can make the dumbest decision every minute. Watching it is physically painful.And then there's the architecture and technology. Are you kidding me? You're on an island full of predators, and everything makes noise - doors bang, systems whir, everything clatters. It's as if the designers intentionally made it easier for dinosaurs to find and eat everyone. Total nonsense.In conclusion: this film is hollow, annoying, and completely disrespectful to the audience. No plot, no sensible characters, no proper dinosaurs. Just noise, stupidity, and monstrosities. A \"rebirth\"... into something much, much worse.",

I even liked his 2014 Godzilla movie more than most people, so I am far from a hater.I'll break this down into three pros and cons to keep this short.Pros:1) There are dinosaurs.2) Some great location photography, especially in Thailand.3) There are a couple of great moments of grandeur, although the best one for me (revealing a herd in a valley) relies on a lot of nostalgia farming. Still, it's effective. There's also a sequence with a raft that feels like Spielberg could have directed it, in a good way.Cons:1) The script is bad. Lots of exposition, despite the fact that the plot is very simplistic. Some of the characters are annoying. Everything is very predictable, to the point that there's really not a single surprise. There's little tension or sense of danger or even mystery.2) The cast. Most of them seem to be here to collect a paycheck. Scarlett Johansson seems a little miscast for the character she's playing, though I'd still primarily blame the writing rather than her performance. Jonathan Bailey is a non-entity. Mahershala Ali is wasted. None of these characters are memorable. The best character is probably a tiny dinosaur they meet along the way that gets a few easy \"aww\" moments. It's cheap, but it works.3) The special effects. As far as I could tell, the dinosaurs are 100% CGI (or close to it). Dominion was far from good but the mix of practical and CGI effects was nice to see, and a step in the right direction. I was hoping for more of that here, especially since there are several opportunities for practical effects once they get on the island. Everything looks artificial. It's also one of those movies where despite the great location photography, some of the environments still look really fake.Anyway... the last three movies in this franchise have all been pretty bad. I don't expect something on par with the first Jurassic Park, but I think we could do a little better than this!5/10.",

I'll eat my words. This is the absolutely the best Jurassic anything since 1993's Jurassic Park started it all. By a mudslide.YES, it has ALL the Jurassic/ancient tropes: clichés, Deus ex Machina saves, characters you absolutely know will be dino-dinners, predictability, nostalgia bait, kids in peril, the infamous \"what could possibly go wrong\" plans and out-of-this-world coincidences, all of which appear in the whole franchise. And DESPITE all that, this felt like thee most original one since number one. I truly had a grand time with this solid adventure.A group of specialized people are summoned by yet another greedy, \"well-meaning\" corp to obtain three live samples of dinos living near the equator on another, gulp!, InGen isle. And, yes, as mentioned...what could possibly go...oh you know. The usual.As stated in the beginning, this is all-but a retread of part III...only as if a young Spielberg directed it. Truly, this was a callback to fun, adventurous Steven's visions. And by \"callback to fun, adventurous Steven's visions,\" I mean before his first JP sequel, The Lost World. And by \"before his first JP sequel, The Lost World,\" I mean, in that same realm only more defined.I'm not kidding. This was a fun time and it blew me away. Granted, I had the lowest of expectations and wasn't even planning on watching it at all after those last two painful outings. I only went to see this as an \"AMC Screen Unseen\" not-so-mystery movie (no detective work was needed when they announced it was PG-13 and its 2 hours 14-minute length - no other soon-to-be release matched) and its most convenient showing/time/location.Even with low expectations and all the tropes, I felt these characters were far more real than 90% of the series. And regardless of the painful, albeit necessary character development we needed to care for them, I still did root for the ones I correctly predicted would live.Of course, these movies should've ended with Part 2's The Lost World. Okay, maybe with Part 4's Jurassic World. I'm just glad they rebounded, rebirthed?, extremely well with Part 7.YES, it's recommended! Definitely see it when it comes out and with the best screen/effects.***Final Thoughts: Here's my current ranking:1. Jurassic Park (1993)\n2. Jurassic World: Rebirth (2025)\n3.

For every positive in the film, there was a corresponding negative. Gareth Edwards is always on point with cinematography and shot composition. The fact that this was shot on film was noticeable in a positive way. The visuals looked bright during the day, avoiding that blue-tinted filter most blockbusters use these days.The Mosasaur and T-Rex sequences are actually thrilling, with the T-Rex being legitimately terrifying for the first time since \"The Lost World\". The effects for the dinosaurs were great, though I do miss the use of practical effects. What I don't miss is the inclusion of mutants and hybrids. I go to these movies to see dinosaurs, not monsters. There are plenty of other franchises for that. The Mutadons and D-Rex serve the same narrative purpose as the raptors (who got completely sidelined here) and the T-Rex. If they had simply swapped them out for those two in the third act, I'd have been much happier.Also not helping were the characters. The family subplot could-and should-have been removed entirely. They add nothing to the story and waste screentime. The expedition team are all stereotypes, but Mahershala Ali at least stands out. Honestly, I think he would've been fantastic as the lead here instead of Scarlett Johansson.All that said, I went in with no expectations and still found myself mildly entertained. I can't help but smile when the John Williams \"Jurassic Park\" score plays and it made a few welcome appearances here. This is definitely a 'paint-by-numbers' Jurassic movie, but I wouldn't be upset if Gareth Edwards got another chance to direct one. 7/10.",

Jurassic Park was actually the very first movie I ever saw in a theater, so it's always held a special place in my heart. And even though none of the sequels ever truly lived up to the original, I still made sure to watch every single one. But this last one? It's in a league of its own-just for all the wrong reasons.First off, how do you end up with worse graphics than a movie that came out 32 years ago? That completely blows my mind. The original's visuals were stunning and still hold up today, yet this one looked and felt like a bad video game from start to finish.And while I know it's not entirely fair to keep comparing everything to the first film, the difference in characters is hard to ignore. The original had a brilliant \"squad\": two paleontologists, a chaotician, a lawyer, and two kids-one of whom actually knew a lot about dinosaurs. This time? We got a group of people who seemed to know nothing about dinosaurs, security, or... well, anything really.The whole movie just felt like an overlong escape room full of shouting, screaming, and clumsy, almost cartoonish dinosaurs that didn't even seem to know how to hunt properly.

I wish I could say it was because of enthusiasm for the series, but that has largely been beaten out of me at this point. I wish I could say that Rebirth was a film that reignited my love of the franchise but, whilst it's fine, it's largely another retread.Dinosaurs have proven ill adjusted to the climate of most modern countries, with those that have survived clustering around the equator. Martin Krebs (Rupert Friend) representative of ParkerGenix believes that genetic material from three live dinosaurs will help with the research into heart disease that his company are planning. He hires Zora Bennett (Scarlett Johannson) and Henry Loomis (Jonathan Bailey) as lead and scientific expert of his expedition, and they head to the island of Ile Saint-Hubert. But the island was InGen's genetics experiment hub, abandoned following an incident years earlier.To stress, I didn't think that \"Rebirth\" was a bad film. I thought the central performances were good and I liked the chemistry between Johansson and Bailey and the endless charisma of Mahershala Ali. I thought the film looked really good Gareth Edwards is a great visual film maker and has plenty of experience with large scale creatures.The problem is that it's essentially 'another' Jurassic movie and feels like its plot is cribbed almost entirely from existing elements of the series. The stranded family from \"Jurassic World 3\", the experts from \"Lost World\", the really dangerous 'final boss' creature from \"World\" - with a nod towards the jails underneath Jabba's palace.Without any sort of new angle the word I kept coming back to when thinking about the film was 'inessential' and, once again whilst this was fine, I do feel like the whole franchise could benefit from a lengthy break.",

It still works as a decent popcorn flick if you're just in the mood for some dino-action without expecting much else.When Scarlett Johansson was announced as part of the cast, I had high hopes for a standout performance, especially given her strong track record and the charisma Chris Pratt brought to the previous Jurassic World films. Unfortunately, the film doesn't give her much to work with, and her potential feels underutilized.What really lets this movie down is its tone. The signature humor that helped balance the tension in earlier films is noticeably absent. Even worse, the horror and suspense hallmarks of any good dinosaur movie are dialed way down, leaving the action feeling flat.The story itself is a mess. It stumbles at the start, never quite finds its rhythm, and ends without impact. The plot feels disjointed, and the characters are poorly developed, you never feel emotionally invested in what's happening.And then there's the CGI. For a franchise known for groundbreaking visual effects, this entry is shockingly subpar. The effects are shabby and unconvincing, which really takes you out of the experience.Bottom line: it's a missed opportunity in almost every way.

The film strips away the glossy overkill of the last few installments & rebuilds with tension, wonder, & grounded horror.The new D-Rex is absolutely terrifying, finally bringing to life the scrapped hybrid concept teased from the original JP4 drafts. It's a menacing, intelligently-used threat that doesn't feel over the top, but deeply unsettling. The raptors are back to being cold-blooded predators, unpredictable & primal, just as they should be.Scarlett delivers a fantastic performance, grounding the human element with a blend of empathy & grit. The river sequence in particular is iconic, a suspenseful, beautifully shot set piece that captures the awe & danger Spielberg's original was known for.This isn't just fan service, it's payoff.

I really loved the dinosaurs in the film as well as they looked so fantastic as well on the big screen yet again although some CGI looks really choppy at times and there's a certain character in this film who I thought was horrible and useless as well I don't want to get into spoilers since this film doesn't come out for two weeks. My biggest complaint with the film is how most of these characters in this movie have so much plot armor I swear most of these characters should've died like multiple times but they didn't due to some insane plot armor in the movie. I also feel like like the D-Rex was hyped up to be this super evil dinosaur and villain of the film but I swear that dinosaur is in this movie for maybe like 5 minutes and that's about it so if you're going into this movie expecting this dinosaur to play a crucial role prepared to be disappointed. The cinematography in this movie though was absolutely stunning and fantastic it seriously might be the best in this entire franchise including Jurassic Park and I enjoyed some of the more horror elements thrown into the movie as well as it gives me some actual scares in the movie as well.

From its very first frames, the film announces a shift in tone: retro aesthetics lend a nostalgic yet distinct visual palette, while the story grounds itself not in multiversal noise, but in human decisions and scientific curiosity. This is a Marvel film that respects both the super and the human.Unlike most origin stories, the setup here is brisk and assured. The film's first act is structured to give audiences a quick, satisfying look at the team's backstory and past deeds, never lingering too long but still managing to earn every emotional beat. There's no hand-holding, and yet nothing feels rushed.Where this film truly surprises is in its character work. Johnny Storm isn't just the loud, reckless sibling - here, his intelligence is finally given equal weight, offering context to his presence among astronauts. Ben Grimm, too, is more than the \"muscle\"; there's a deep sincerity to his character, a balance of science and strength. The team chemistry feels lived-in - full of quiet bickering, mutual admiration, and a rhythm only shared by families who've been through things together. Their bond feels earned.Villain-wise, First Steps pulls off a rarity: a visually formidable Galactus rendered with restraint, not excess. Though Silver Surfer purists may still hold a soft spot for Doug Jones' performance in Rise of the Silver Surfer, this iteration serves the story's vision well. And in a surprise turn, even HERBIE - the team's robo companion - is no gimmick. The CGI character is narratively vital, not just another quip machine.Director Matt Shakman strikes an impressive balance between science-fiction and superheroism, giving each frame a purpose. The film doesn't lean heavily on humor (thankfully), instead relying on strong dramatic beats, coherent action, and a screenplay that embraces a comic-book sensibility - particularly during its stylized crescendo.Visually, the film is a treat. From cosmic scenes to grounded lab environments, everything feels tangible and lived-in. The action is clean, never bloated, with each power sequence well-thought-out and easy to follow. While the score doesn't stand out as a whole, it's used judiciously, heightening the right moments without becoming overwhelming.Despite being part of a sprawling cinematic universe, First Steps works remarkably well as a standalone. It carves space for the Fantastic Four without relying on MCU cameos or overstuffed references. That said, the post-credit scene is minimal yet seismic - enough to send a wave of gasps through the theatre.Sum up - The Fantastic Four: First Steps is both a film and a foundation. It's smart without being cold, epic without losing intimacy, and finally gives Marvel's First Family the treatment they deserve. More than a comeback - this is a course correction.",

            "review": "\"The Fantastic Four: First Steps\" is a story about family above all else, where each member of the team is equally important. The movie excels when fleshing out the various bonds between Pedro, Vanessa, Ebon, & Joseph.Pedro nails Reed's stoicism and dashing brilliance, while Joseph makes Johnny feel ever so valiant. But man, I can't remember the last time I adored two Marvel heroes like Ebon's Ben and Vanessa's Sue. They hold the family together and ground the others when no one else can. Silver Surfer is perfection with this metallic voice and looks really really good. Galactus is awesome in IMAX.The combination of practical effects and CGI is...you guessed it...Fantastic...say that again! VFX were immaculate. Cosmically and on Earth, Matt Shakman dropped a visual feast. It is stunning, stylish, self-contained, and easy to jump into. I had such a good time with this one. The retrofuturism is so pleasing. The retro '60s aesthetic works on all fronts.Marvel's first family shines with chemistry & charisma Stan Lee and Jack Kirby would be proud of. The \"FF\" dazzle from start to finish, Matt Shakman delivers one of Marvel's best. Michael Giacchino's score is triumphant and easily his best work in the MCU. Can't wait to watch it again tomorrow!There are 2 credit scenes, but you already know, that you'll stay for them. Fantastic!",

He is being done dirty for a long time.2. There was chemistry between the cast. The chemistry was better than 2015 version but it wasn't better than the 2005 one.3. Galactus was done right you could feel his presence in IMAX.4. I liked Joseph Quinn. He kept the legacy alive of good human torches.Now for cons1. Pedro was such a miscast. He played himself. He is not right for Reed.2. It has more wacky shots than the good ones. The CGI looks unfinished at some points.3. It was poorly edited. We know they cut 15 to 20 minutes and you could feel it. Something was missing.4. CGI baby. I think it's about time they stop using the CGI baby. It was giving uncanny vibes.5. Reed was really underwhelming. He barely used his powers.6. Although it was only 1 hour 55 minutes long yet it felt longer than other movies which are longer. The pacing was horrible.7. Most of it was spoiled in the trailers. If you saw all promotional videos and trailer you just saw 50 percent of the movie.8. The last act was horrible. It felt like that Yelena scene from Black Widow.9. This movie felt like it was missing a whole act. They should have given creative control to the director.10. They could have done the post credit better.This was a misfire by marvel and they should be worried beacuse it is directly related to Doomsday. It is really average. It places at 2nd last in the ranking of 2025 CBM.I am really disappointed. Fantastic four are one of my favourite characters and they missed another time. When we will get a good F4 film?

I was really not keen on seeing the film, but then my son asked, and we also got to see Galactus in the last trailer, so I thought we would go for it. Even if Galactus is cool and the rest sucks, that would be something.The film looks great; they nail the comic book look, and I cannot really fault it in that regard. Sadly, that's about it. The CGI ranges from passable to excellent, the script is very dumb in parts....but passable. The \"female\" Silver Surfer was fine; there was a plot point that made the Surfer's gender a necessary story element. The casting just felt off, not terrible, but something did not click.....And worst of all was the utter waste of Galactus.Going by trailers, it looked like we would finally get some full-on action, but (no real spoiler apart from what he does) what we get is chatty Galactus, \"ouch\" Galactus, and walking past buildings Galactus....... Oh, and one other Galactus that made it even worse.I have to say, right up to the Space trip and meeting (trying to keep details low), I was pleasantly surprised, and I did start to get my hopes up.

I've seen many talk about the heart of this movie but for the most part everything is generic and lacks soul for the most part, I won't say it has no soul at all but at least they try. Thunderbolts seem 10 times better to me in all aspects. The biggest fraud of the movie is Reed since he does not act like the leader he should be.It doesn't break any ground, as it's the same story as the 2007 film, but with better visuals and a bigger budget.

It is very apparent that F4 are not a match and not well established yet for such a universal threat and that leads to 2nd point.Pacing. As I mentioned before, this is the reboot so we are not acquainted with the characters yet. We do not know how capable are they, how well received are them among the people, the state of the world and the multiverse they live in. And we do not know anything about the villain and their capabilities as well. They have to cram all these and more in a two hour movie because they are overly ambitious. I did not feel that I belong in their world because they don't have enough show time to set the stage and at times, all I can feel is the poor CGI world, like I am in a game from 2000s. If you don't feel like you belong to that world, you have no attachment leading to no sense of real threat that the villain is supposed to pose. And also since they don't have enough show time to show premonitions and preparations for the villain, the plot had to make up for it with the director turning a blind eyes to glaring plot holes which is the third issue.Plot holes. The villain can squeeze all of them to death like Darth Vader. The villain can end the world in a blink of an eye. Even all F4 members combined cannot beat the villain's herald not to mention the main villain. Enough said. So they used all kinds of plot holes and \"talk no jitsu\" to make sense as to why they won. And the worst part? You won't see any real fight scenes. Villain is too powerful to fight head on anyway so they resort to using plot holes and warm holes. And the ill timed forced humour during serious life or death situations like the \"clobbering time\" joke is such a sad attempt.Overall, had very good potential to be a good intro movie and followed up by a good sequel but they got greedy and ended up with this.",

This new film reminded me much of original happenings from these magazines. A very good adaption.I will not give away much more, so I will reccommend you to go and see the film for yourself!Some changes could still be seen here as in the original Fantastic Four cartoon from the 1960s in the USA (1970s in Norway), the Silver Surfer was portrayed as male, consistent with his comic book identity as Norrin Radd, the herald of Galactus.However, in the 2025 reboot film \"The Fantastic Four: First Steps\", the Silver Surfer is portrayed as female, specifically the character Shalla-Bal, played by Julia Garner. This version is set in an alternate universe and represents a creative departure from the traditional depiction.Galactus was first introduced to Norwegian readers in the comic series \"Et Fantastiske Fire Eventyr\" in 1973, specifically in issue #2, titled \"Galactus kommer\" (\"Galactus is coming\").This issue featured the classic Galactus saga originally created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, which also introduced the Silver Surfer. It was part of the early wave of Marvel comics translated and published in Norway during the 1970s.Looking forward for future episodes of F4 (if they come ;-) )",

Despite the promise of a fresh take on Marvel's First Family, the film struggles with shallow character development, leaving Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn), and Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) feeling like archetypes rather than a cohesive, relatable family. The script fails to capitalize on the emotional depth of their bond, making their interactions feel flat and their stakes less personal than advertised. The retro-futuristic 1960s setting is visually striking but often feels like a gimmick that overshadows the story. Worse, the CGI is distractingly unpolished, with some scenes looking like they were rushed through post-production. While Ralph Ineson's Galactus is a menacing highlight, his cosmic threat feels underutilized, overshadowed by a plot that meanders between generic superhero action and underdeveloped subplots. Compared to the MCU's best, this feels like a missed opportunity, more \"meh\" than marvelous.\"Fantastic Four: First Steps was a major letdown. The film's attempts at modernizing the classic characters fell flat, with poorly executed CGI and lackluster performances from the cast. The story was predictable and formulaic, with too much repetition and not enough originality. The pacing was slow, and the dialogue often felt forced and cheesy.

            "review": "I love it when movies mix different genres and create a fresh spin on old themes. In this case however the different elements didn't mix well in my opinion: I would describe sinners as a mix between period gangster drama, musical and trashy B-movie horror. This sounds super exciting on paper, but in reality it threw me off completely. I feel like the movie tries to do everything at the same time but doesn't deliver on many of those aspects: It wants to hit the viewer on an emotional level but left me personally completely cold - I didn't care who died or who lived; The movie kinda wants to be scary but the \"enemies\" in the film feel like a complete joke from the first scene they are shown and it takes away all the tension; It wants to be action-packed and explosive, but the fight scenes are kinda boring and left me wanting to move on to more serious scenes again, even though those serious scenes are kind of a slow burn; The film wants to be funny and even though it made me chuckle a bit it never really took it far enough to justify sacrificing the big threat in the film for laughs.In conclusion: This movie is too boring and slow to be an entertaining action-comedy and doesn't take the humor and fight scenes far enough to really have an impact. At the same time this movie is far too ridiculous to be a serious scary and emotional movie that reaches you on any kind of emotional level.I would have liked it, if they would have sacrificed the humor for building a serious threat that feels genuinely scary and terrifying. The cinematography, costumes and music are fantastic but this is just not enough for me to make it a good film, when the story is not hitting. There are single parts of the movie that I absolutely loved and I would have really appreciated those scenes as standalone music videos, but it just doesn't mix well with the rest in my personal opinion.In addition to my previous criticisms I spotted some typical clichés in the dialogue writing that made me roll my eyes and there were some moments where I found it extremely hard to believe that certain characters survived. I could go in to detail here but I want to keep my review vague to avoid spoilers.To me watching this movie felt a bit like eating chocolate on a burger - Both elements are nice by themselves but together they don't make for a nice meal.",

Sinners is one of the best examples of this.Aside from the music, I could tell I was watching high-quality filmmaking within five minutes. The directing, camerawork, editing, and sound design are pristine. The entire cast does a great job, but Michael B. Jordan shines. He is a superstar.Sinners is also surprisingly funny, without taking away from the seriousness. And the horror elements are... satisfying. This movie goes hard.Advice: Certain scenes have an expanded aspect ratio that will only be shown in IMAX. If you can't go to an IMAX, any premium screen will do (Dolby Cinema, UltraScreen, EMX, etc). This movie benefits more than most from the larger screen and louder speakers.Also, I missed A LOT of the dialogue, you may want to ask for a closed caption device.(1 viewing, opening night IMAX 4/17/2025)",

            "review": "Director and writer Ryan Coogler shared that some of his most vivid cinematic memories come from watching horror films in theaters as a young man - experiences that sparked his deep love for cinema. According to him, \"Sinners\" is a kind of love letter to that feeling, crafted with the hope that viewers in theaters will experience the same thrill. And honestly? Mission accomplished.\"Sinners\" is one of those films best experienced with as little prior knowledge as possible - we strongly recommend not reading anything, not watching trailers, and avoiding all conversations about it beforehand if you can. The film's plot flows with organic ease, taking unexpected and refreshing turns that hit especially well if you go in spoiler-free. So we'll steer clear of plot details here, too.The initial inspiration behind the film came from Coogler's connection to his late uncle, James, who had a deep interest in music and history, particularly in the Mississippi blues tradition. James's stories and musical tastes left a lasting impression on Coogler and sparked the creative process that ultimately became this film. As you might guess, \"Sinners\"is at its core a musical film. Not in the sense of a musical or a movie with original songs woven in like \"Django Unchained\" - rather, music is part of \"Sinners\"' DNA. It's interwoven into the story, the characters, and the entire atmosphere, offering a unique lens on the culture, folklore, traditions, and struggles of the Black community in 1930s Mississippi.The man behind the original score is the multi-talented Ludwig Göransson (\"Oppenheimer\", \"Tenet\", \"Black Panther\"), who, beyond being a top-tier music producer, continually reinvents himself with every project he touches. \"Sinners\" is no exception. In his relatively short but rich career, Göransson has produced electronic scores, orchestral compositions, and even rap and R&B. Here, he pivots once again - blending the score with musical production in an inspired exploration of the Blues and Country genres, in line with the film's tone. Traditional sounds, ambient textures, and gritty audio design are all used to balance the experience.It's undoubtedly one of the finest soundtracks we've heard in recent years - one that elevates the film to another level. Göransson continues to prove himself as one of the most gifted musicians of our era, and it's no wonder that none other than Christopher Nolan chose him as his go-to composer, following Hans Zimmer. In \"Sinners\", the soundtrack also features live performances and original songs, and a separate album has even been released featuring both songs from the film and those inspired by it.Visually, Coogler made a bold artistic choice - one reminiscent of cinema's greatest auteurs, like Nolan and Denis Villeneuve - to shoot the film using wide-format film stock, opting for analog cinematography. Specifically, the most grand and pure formats available: IMAX 15-perf 70mm and Ultra Panavision 70mm. This wasn't just an aesthetic decision, but an effort to merge the raw texture of classic cinema with the sheer visual power of modern technology - a symbolic gesture aligning with the themes the film explores. Coogler even sought guidance from Nolan himself, along with Emma Thomas, to master the use of these formats - not for bragging rights, but to amplify the film's emotional weight.Another standout aspect of the film is the screenplay. It's written with a natural rhythm and flow, featuring smart, unexpected humor and effortlessly blending a range of genres. Coogler, who served as both writer and director, brings the script to life with mastery, drawing the best out of each genre he touches. Above all, his use of the IMAX format is impressively deliberate and effective.Michael B. Jordan plays two distinct characters in the film - and not in a gimmicky or disconnected way. These characters interact constantly - they're twins - which makes for a serious acting challenge. Jordan rises to the occasion, and the visual effects team behind the scenes pulls it off beautifully, with impressive execution on every technical level. Visually, the film is nothing short of stunning.Alongside Jordan, musician Miles Caton gives a remarkably strong performance in the second lead role. I was genuinely surprised to learn this was his first-ever acting role. Jack O'Connell is also outstanding, and the radiant Hailee Steinfeld dazzles on screen and delivers a compelling performance. While she doesn't sing in the film itself, she is featured on the movie's official soundtrack. Overall, the cast is excellent, and the chemistry is on point.Every few months, there comes along an event film that simply must be seen - and \"Sinners\" is unquestionably one of them. It's one of the best films we've seen in recent memory: energetic, gripping, occasionally funny, with a sharp script, top-tier directing, brilliant performances, and musical ingenuity that stuns scene after scene. It has all the makings of a strong contender for film of the year. We highly recommend watching it in theaters - in the best auditorium you can find. IMAX, if possible, is absolutely the way to go.Written by Dvir971 & Orr971.",

If I had to rate them separately: the first half is a solid 8, the second a disappointing 4.The film starts off brilliantly. Set in the Deep South during the 1930s, it plunges us into a world of chain gangs, overt racism, and raw human struggle-all wrapped in the soul of music. The characters are distinctive and memorable, the performances are top-notch, and the world-building is rich and atmospheric. It's a western, a drama, and a musical all at once, and somehow it works. For a while.Then comes the second half.This is where things fall apart. The pivot to horror-specifically vampires-feels abrupt and half-hearted. There's barely a story holding it together, and the horror/action sequences barely last 10-15 minutes. They lack any real suspense or memorable set pieces. The execution feels rushed and undercooked, especially after such a powerful setup.The final 5-7 minutes attempt a bold anti-Klan message, and it's likely this moment of violence and symbolism that won over many critics. But for me, it was too little, too late.What's most frustrating is the wasted potential. This could've been a truly unique vampire film-rooted in history, rich in theme, driven by character and song. Instead, it leaves you wondering what could've been if the second half had lived up to the promise of the first.",

After finally watching it, I can say with confidence that this is my favorite movie so far to come out in 2025. When twin brother Smoke and Stack return home from Chicago to rural Mississippi for a fresh start, they decide to take what earnings they got left to open a nightclub. Unfortunately, other than some of their old hometown friends, old lovers, and a cousin, a much evil and greater force awaits for them just in time for the debut night of their new club. For starters, Michael B. Jordan gives probably the best performance of his career so far as the twins Smoke and Stack, bringing a different persona and personality to each of the characters. Hailee Steinfeld as Mary is magnificent and for the most part has some of the best character development of the film. Wunmi Mosaku as Annie is also great in this film, while also being a huge part of the heart and soul of it. Miles Caton as Sammie Moore is also a great addition to this film and plays a very important role in it. Omar Miller as Cornbread was also a great addition. Delroy Lindo as Delta Slim also gives a great supporting performance, while also having some of the best lines and moments of the movie. Finally Jack O' Connell as Remmick and the main villain of the movie was absolutely fantastic, terrifying, while also charming in a way and is probably one the best horror movie villains I've seen in recent years. Every time his character is on screen, he steals the show and more than gets the audience's attention. If there's anything negative I have to say about the film which is little to none, I would say in the first act, it took awhile for the story to get going, but once it does finally start to take off, it makes everything more than worth while. For positives, I would like to point out that music playing a huge role and technically a character itself in the film was sensational. The horror elements were also well done, as well as a couple of action scenes that were very impressive. Overall, Sinners is so far my favorite movie of 2025, with great performances all the way around, great cinematography, and a really great story with the direction of Ryan Coogler giving Jordan Peele a run for his money in the horror genre.

The film sets a moody, atmospheric tone and builds tension with a deliberate, slow-burn approach that hints at something truly impactful. Unfortunately, that promise is never fulfilled. When the vampires finally appear, the film takes a sharp downturn. Their behavior is nonsensical, lacking any real menace or intelligence, and they end up feeling more like a parody than a threat. It's a baffling creative choice that undermines everything the first half works so hard to build. Despite its strong technical elements, the film stumbles badly at the finish line. A stylish misfire-watchable, but disappointing. 6 out of 10.",

S. black population, and others lorded over by oppressors.Subsequently, two brothers and a community must decide how they can exploit music for profit... Or, to make them less vulnerable to the evil it was thought to generate. The use of special effects is clever and not too distracting...though, this IS, afterall a monster movie.Delroy Lindo should get a nice tux and start preparing some comments because he is going to become the center of this film's gravitational pull for months....scene stealer extraordinaire; a classic supporting actor triumph. Michael B Jordan's multifaceted role also worthy of some extra attention.And then, there's the music.... 🎼 +++ which is enhanced by costumes, which is enhanced by sets.

From the first frame, it pulls you into its world, carried by the charisma of its characters and the crackling tension that steadily builds. The movie feels like it has the DNA of the era's music embedded into every scene that is soulful, gritty, and alive.That emotional heartbeat is darkly, almost violently, contrasted when the supernatural element enters, bringing a wave of gore and terror that feels both inevitable and shocking. The cast is masterful, owning the early, quieter character-driven moments with such authenticity that when hell finally breaks loose, you feel every second of it.By the time Sinners reaches its devastating, poignant ending, you're left not just shaken but thinking. It's the kind of film that lingers long after the credits roll.",

The story's structure is one of the documentary's strongest achievements, sustaining tension while steadily deepening the mystery.Yet the film stumbles in key areas. Most notably, it gives the perpetrator far too much space, allowing their voice to dominate without sufficient critical framing. This imbalance is compounded by the absence of a deeper psychological perspective, which could have provided crucial context for understanding the behavior and its broader implications. Instead, viewers are left with raw testimony that at times feels more like a platform than an examination.By downplaying analysis in favor of dramatic storytelling, Unknown Number risks prioritizing shock value over insight. While it succeeds in keeping audiences hooked, its reluctance to interrogate the subject matter leaves the narrative feeling incomplete.The result is a documentary that is compelling in rhythm and atmosphere, but ultimately weaker in responsibility and depth. Above all, it is difficult not to feel deep sympathy for all those affected by the events, people whose experiences deserved a more thoughtful and nuanced exploration than the film delivers.",

Skye Borgman has a knack for unravelling these twisted real-life stories in a way that keeps you glued to the screen, and this one is no exception. What starts out as your typical small-town teenage drama quickly spirals into something far darker, more disturbing, and honestly, pretty unbelievable.The most shocking part isn't just the relentless harassment, but the psychology behind it all. It's crazy what mental illness does to people, especially when it goes unchecked - and watching this unfold, you can't help but feel that she never truly grasped the gravity of what she did. Instead, what comes across is an almost chilling level of detachment, the behaviour of an absolute narcissist who couldn't (or wouldn't) comprehend the damage caused.As a documentary, it's tight, pacey, and completely bingeable - the kind of thing you finish and immediately want to discuss with someone. But it also left me thinking how many stories like this never see the light of day. Personally, I wish Netflix would give the same treatment to the Amanda Todd case - a tragedy that deserves a thorough, sensitive documentary.If you're into true crime that blends high school drama with the sinister realities of catfishing and cyberbullying, this one is absolutely worth your time.",

It's all anecdotal. The doc also never challenges the perp's belief that their trauma justifies their behavior, as though millions of other people haven't also suffered childhood trauma yet somehow manage to NOT harass and threaten others. I'm sure most viewers are smart enough to draw this conclusion, but the way the story is told leaves a lot to be desired in the way of rational discourse on what happened.The way the mystery was set up felt like a weird lead-on. The way the events are recounted is intentionally deceptive, which is insulting as a viewer. Great job Netflix, you got me to watch your mysterious documentary!

There are moments that try to capture the spirit of the original, some visual gags, a few quirky lines, and the familiar chaotic absurdity. But it just doesn't hit the mark.The original Naked Gun had something truly special: every single scene was packed with clever jokes, whether in the dialogue or hidden in the background. You could rewatch it multiple times and still catch new, subtle gags. That layered humor, the timing, the delivery, the straight-faced absurdity is what made it a classic.In this new version, it often feels like the filmmakers are trying too hard or relying too much on nostalgia, without fully understanding what made the original work. The pacing is slower, the humor is more forced, and at times it slips into just being silly rather than smartly absurd.It's not a bad film, but as someone who grew up laughing at every frame of the original, I can't help but feel this reboot lacks the sharpness, charm, and fearless stupidity that made Naked Gun legendary.Still I appreciate the effort.

There was probably about 7 times I got a chuckle, I enjoyed hearing the old music and such but, it just fell flat more me. The jokes were just not that funny, the plot was meh, and the acting just cannot compare to the original.Leslie Nielson and the original cast just nailed everything with ease and it was laugh out loud comedy.I left the theater unimpressed but, just my opinion on this.

Pamela Anderson is game and the scene with her singing is excellent, she looked great, too. Paul Walter Hauser has a scent role, but isn't really given much to do, whilst Danny Huston hams it up as the villain and it's always nice to see Kevin Durrand, even if he is under used. There is a surprise cameo which made me smile.I smiled a lot during this movie, it made me think of my Dad, who loved these movies. It is the most I have laughed in the cinema in a long time, but it's not up there with Tropic Thunder, Something About Mary, Four Weddings & A Funeral and The Birdcage, as my favourite comedies I've seen on the big screen!! Those had serious long belly laughs in the cinema, with everyone cracking up. There are not many better things than watching a hilarious movie, with a packed crowd.

So tense, so relentless, I genuinely forgot to breathe at points.The Philippou brothers have done it again.

This film gets under your skin early and doesn't let go.The performances are excellent across the board (Sally Hawkins is devastating), but what really struck me was the direction. The shots are fantastic - meticulously framed, textured, and always hinting at something sinister lurking just out of frame.And the gore. OMG, the gore. Not gratuitous, but felt - visceral, unnerving, and timed so well that even I, who usually handles horror like a champ, found myself getting properly squeamish.The payoff? 100% worth it.

It's bleak, extremely visceral, unrelenting and really emotionally devastating ... but in the best ways horror can be!As soon as the movie starts revealing its evil side, it takes hold of you and doesn't let go.All the actors portrayed their characters with emotional and realistic excellence, but Sally Hawkins was just unmatched. It's hard to really describe her performance without getting into spoiler territory, but she couldn't have done a better job at being so unnerving & emotionally powerful, both at the same time.The cinematography was incredible, with heaps of little foreshadowing details sprinkled throughout the film. So many of the shots were precisely made to convey & ooze that feeling of uneasiness/dread, which just adds that extra layer to the film's atmosphere.Speaking of the atmosphere, the Philippou brothers sure know how to pack a punch with their direction. While there is still a deeply emotional and brutal story at play here, the brothers don't mind having loose ends here and there & instead, they are more after that gut-wrenching, stomach-churning horror experience as a whole.That brings me to the practical effects...\nSomehow, this film got a classification of only MA15+ in Australia, and that just baffles me in the best way possible.After 'Talk To Me', I was expecting some pretty skin-crawling gore & practical effects, but boy oh boy, I wasn't expecting this.This film just ramps up the violence on every level and is done so in a way that will have even the hardcore horror fans wincing, incredible stuff!In all, this movie makes their debut film 'Talk To Me' come across as a fun horror movie to watch after 'Bring Her Back', just to wind down.It's a slow burn descent into hell & by the end of the film, actually ends up being one of the more depressingly sad/emotional horror films I've seen in some time.It will make you feel sick, sad & terrified, all at the same time.Well done RackaRacka !",

            "review": "BRING HER BACK was everything I hoped it would be. It will absolutely nauseate thousands of people. While many will recognize it's greatness, an equal amount will call it \"a terrible movie\" because it will so effectively fill them with intensely negative feelings throughout it's entire runtime, as it intends to do, and as most of the greatest horror movies of all time do. It is utterly brutal, and wholly unnerving, with the power to sicken and traumatize. There are plenty of movies that feature relentless amounts of brutal violence, but BRING HER BACK manages to disturb on a deeper level, likely by way of the great majority of it's brutality occurring amongst children (and, kids who are being manipulated by an adult, on top of everything else). It is painful to watch things unfold, and that's what makes it a truly effective horror film.I took a chance on the directors' first film TALK TO ME when it hit theaters a couple of years ago, and was blown away. Not only was it fiercely original with it's concepts and it's vibe, but it was more fun than the majority of horror films, and got WAY more cruel and intense than I was expecting in its second half. When I saw the trailer for this, I knew it was highly likely they would be taking the cruelty even further, and that is precisely what they have done.Casting lead Sally Hawkins in this role is the most brilliant casting utilization I have seen this year thus far. She is most commonly known as playing heartwarming characters (like Paddington's adoptive mother), but here, as the villain she is utterly terrifying - I think that knack for playing warm characters adds to the horror of her character immensely, and with these elements combined it leads to by far the best performance I've ever seen by her - fully gut-wrenching. All of the kids that fill out of the rest of the cast were phenomenal as well. I can't even imagine being Jonah Wren Phillips and playing the poster boy character Oliver - the role is so colossally intense, it makes me wonder if it's going to effect him in reality for the rest of his life - I feel like it will have to in some form.Beyond all else, it's clear that the Philippou brothers are intelligent people. They know how to dig into the audiences psyche with such precision, and one of the key ways they do that is by keeping their films rich with a level of psychological depth that a great majority of horror films are missing nowadays. The movie is brimming with dramatic themes that are the type of things that deeply traumatize children in reality - taking this and rounding it out with some truly hellish supernatural ideas and visual horror, and you have the recipe for an absolutely devastating horror film. I was also impressed with the level of emotive resonance that this brutal film managed to conjure during its finale - I was on the verge of tearing up, and that is very rare for horror. The only reason I don't give it a 10 out of 10 is because I know it will simply be too dark and brutal for a huge chunk of the population, it doesn't exactly cater to repeat viewings.",

She holds the entire film on her shoulders with such precision and emotion that it's honestly Oscar-worthy. I couldn't help but think of Hereditary (2018), where Toni Collette also gave a mind-blowing performance but was completely snubbed by the Academy. Let's hope history doesn't repeat itself.Atmosphere is tense from the very first scene. The film masterfully builds dread without relying on cheap jump scares. The cinematography is elegant and intimate, often using close shots and cold tones to create a feeling of claustrophobia and grief. Sound design and music are subtle but deeply effective - at times you don't even notice them, but they're working in the background, crawling under your skin.This is not just another horror flick.

After their recent hit Talk to Me really blew me away with expert filmmaking, storytelling, hidden details, and strong characterization, I was excited to see their new movie and whether they could repeat that success. In this film, we follow a brother and his stepsister who are sent to live with a foster mother after their father dies. However, something strange is going on, and with the brother's troubled past and the sister's limited vision, their investigation into what is happening in their new home becomes increasingly difficult.I can confidently say that the Philippou brothers did not create a one hit wonder with their debut film because Bring Her Back is an amazing cinematic experience filled with visceral bloody carnage and emotional depth. The movie has a tense atmosphere and some genuinely suspenseful moments that manage to scare without relying on cheap jump scares or tired genre tropes.Even for someone like me who has rated over 3,000 horror films on IMDb, this movie was able to surprise me in several ways. While it becomes clear fairly early where the story is heading, it never felt boring or too predictable. The film features excellent cinematography and strong performances from the entire cast. The characters are interesting and multi-dimensional, and although the themes of trauma and grief are common in the genre, the Philippou brothers introduce them in a fresh and compelling way. \"Enjoyable\" might not be the right word given the dark themes and brutal violence, but the film does not shy away from showing the horrifying things that can be done to the human body.One thing that could have enhanced the experience even further would have been more background information. The movie opens with found footage of a ritual, and I would have loved to learn more about the backstory behind how everything came to be.Even though supernatural horror is not my favorite subgenre because it is filled with lazy films and generic scripts, Bring Her Back managed to both entertain and scare. It is a memorable addition to the genre and has me genuinely excited to see what Danny and Michael do next. I am especially happy for them since I have followed them since their chaotic YouTube days as \"RackaRacka,\" and now they are creating well crafted and horrifying films for the big screen.

The lore, the tone, even the personality of Sonja herself-none of it survives. It's as if the filmmakers skimmed a one-sentence Wikipedia summary and decided to \"make it their own,\" stripping out all the grit, charm, and spirit in the process.Abysmal acting by no-name actors: I'm all for giving new talent a chance, but these performances are painful. Every line sounds rehearsed but never felt. Emotional scenes land with a thud, and action moments feel like the actors are just waiting for someone to yell \"Cut!\" It's wooden, awkward, and sometimes unintentionally funny-but not in a good way.Non-existent budget: I swear the budget for this thing could have been covered by a month's rent in Los Angeles. The sets look like they were assembled in a community hall, with walls that practically wobble if anyone leans too hard. There's no sense of scale, no atmosphere-just cheap backdrops and bad lighting.Inaccurate costume design: Whoever handled costumes either didn't care or had no clue. Instead of the fierce, practical-yet-stylish fantasy gear you'd expect, we get outfits that look like bad cosplay rejects from a discount bin. They don't match the tone, the era, or the character at all.Poor fight choreography: The sword fights are slow, awkward, and so badly timed that it feels like watching kids play-fight in the backyard. Blows clearly miss, reactions are late, and the camera work tries (and fails) to make it look exciting. There's zero weight or danger to anything.Pathetic direction: This is the final nail in the coffin.

She was attractive enough, but not the buxom beauty that made Red's enemies regularly underestimate her. Most importantly, she didn't have the athletic / muscular build that would be required for the part. The choreography was poor to start with, but her lack of power and stamina made it that much worse, as she either obviously pulled her punches or didn't have much punch to start with.Include in this repeated, repeated, repeated stabbing through plate armor and we have constant reminders of \"plastic\" Storm Trooper armor that wouldn't stop a stone shot from a slingshot. Pffft.Typical story, highly predictable. At least it had a semi-twist ending that redeemed it a little. (No spoilers.) Sadly, this is a typical sword-adventure film with an unfortunately unconvincing lightweight main character. Kudos to the actress. She just needed a bit more meat on her bones and (to be blunt) a bit more cleavage to convincingly play the part of Red Sonja. They might have looked at some of the Ladies of Wrestling to find the right build. It's not a \"guy review\" thing; it's a matter of accurate and believable character portrayal. I would describe this actress as more slim / petite than barbarian. She simply needed more \"body\".That said, I'll give kudos to the armor designer who eventually put her in something a little more stout than a barely-there chain mail bikini.

First, the obvious reason a beautiful sword-wielding woman would appeal to a teenage boy; second, for her unique back-story and impressive collection of personality disorders.I've long thought that Red Sonja deserved a film. She has, however, been short-changed in this area. To be sure, this effort is far superior to the abomination featuring Brigitte Neilsen and Arnold Schwarzenegger, but it still left much to be desired. Most importantly, they threw away almost all that is canon about Red Sonja - the traumatic experience in her youth, the intervention by her goddess, and her idiosyncratic oath/curse.Does this matter? Well, I think it does if you're going to call the film Red Sonja.Leaving that aside, this film is not without merit. Matilda Lutz has decent acting chops, and enough charisma to give the film a solid centre. Among the supporting cast, however, Wallis Day as Annistja (a character who does have personality disorders) steals every scene she's in, and would've made a better Sonja. So, possibly, would Danica Davis in the small role of Teresia.The film copes well with Sonja's famous outfit, there are a few laughs between the swordfights, and Robert Sheehan is just villainous enough as Draygen (who has a personality that would make Freud bite his pencil in two).

Matilda Lutz was awesome as Red Sonja and while that isn't a high bar, she is the best version oft his character that I've seen so far. I really enjoyed the supporting cast who join Red Sonja on her revenge mission and they got in the action as well. The villains are entertaining cartoons which should sound bad, but the actors playing them knew what they were doing and I loved it. M. J. Bassett did an excellent job with the action sequences and there was a lot of blood that made me very happy. There is a good mix of practical and digital effects that was done perfectly. And finally, I liked the pacing as everything had a nice flow to the story and it never overstayed its welcome.Negatives for Red Sonja (2025):\nMy only issue is that I wasn't a fan of how the villains were defeated and I do believe that M. J. Bassett could've done something better than what I watched.Overall, Red Sonja (2025) is an entertaining sword and sorcery movie that made me very happy and while I can see some fans of this character not be too happy with some of the things done with this movie, I certainly had a fun time watching this movie.",

The acting was mostly hitting pretty well considering the source material was lacking a certain amount of depth. I would say that each scene just happened too easily without leaving a sense of purpose, complexity or difficulty. There were a lot of gaps and the characters were mostly placeholders, which normally ends a movie for me but I still had a lot of fun with it. The cinematography and soundtrack held the scenes together even as they rushed through the surface-level story. That sounds pretty bad but it was actually quite enjoyable. I fully support this effort and will be watching it again because this movie didn't feel like studio pandering, it has a beating heart to it. Also, the sfx were well done without being overdone. The ending left an opening for a sequel. I hope to see more, but I'd really like to see different. Maybe a little darker. A little deeper. Did anyone else notice the bra strap though?

Yeah, right! Terrifier 2 & 3 did just fine with much more violence. I think most distributors passed on the film because it is pure garbage, easily one of the most moronic Troma films I have ever seen, and that's saying something.I gave it a shot because I found the original The Toxic Avenger to be fairly fun, was intrigued by the impressive cast (Peter Dinklage as Winston AKA Toxie, Kevin Bacon as the villain, Bob Garbinger, and Elijah Wood as Bob's brother Fritz), I thought that the trailer looked promising (hinting at plenty of over-the-top gore), and I thoroughly enjoyed director Macon Blair's I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore. Unfortunately, nothing about this film works. Blair attempts to replicate Lloyd Kaufman's trademark lunacy, with plenty of colourful characters and general craziness, but it all feels so desperate: the gags fall flat and the chaotic direction is loud and obnoxious. The splatter is okay, but nowhere near as excessive as the trailer suggests (and too reliant on CGI).I tried very hard to get into the swing of things - even forced myself to smirk a couple of times - but if truth be told, it wasn't long before I was praying for the film to end.

Now I'm not saying the originals weren't zany and mightily cheesy. It's just for the time that is why they worked. This time around it's like they took gen z humor and threw it at a Gen x property and it just doesn't work. It's cringeworthy in the worst way. At times the extremism of it even goes into territory that gets bordeline creepy.Another huge and glaring aspect is the casting of Peter Dinklage for Toxie . It just doesn't work flat out . I'm really not sure what they were thinking with that . It's also even more flabbergasting they don't even use him in the actual practical suit/mask . He's simply the voice over with a stunt double . Some of the other casting decisions were off as well with even some of the notables. I will say at times the visuals were kind of cool but that was about it .

Its also bloody HILARIOUS at times. There's more than one laugh out loud moment, and, one moment in particual is the funniest thing I've seen in the cinema this year (let me know in the comments which bit you think I'm talking aboutIts ultra violent (the word UNCUT was literally in the title card)There's location text on screen like 'yonder spooky woods' and things like that, wo yeah, very much tongue in cheek and fun in that senseI don't have the affinity to the original that many people do, I've seen the original but It wasn't a staple of my childhood or anything so I've not overwhelming connection to it,So I'm ok with the story changes, with the fact they've rebooted and remade it.Its not Dinklage in the Toxie suit, its Luisa Guerreiro. While she does a great job with the physicality of the role, the reality is all of Dinklage's lines were dubbed in after the fact, and it shows on more than one occasion, when that happens, it takes you out of the movie a little. It does feel like theres a disconnect between the physical role and the voice.I saw it at 9am at a press screening at the Edinburgh Film Festival, so not quite the time or the crowd to fully embrace it. Speaking of embracing it,,,, why don't you go ahead and ... ahem... EMBRACE that SUBSCRIBE button.....THANK YOUIt was then shown to the public at midnight as part of the 'Midnight Madness' line up, I image the atmosphere at that screening was a little more.... lively.--\nOn that not, my good friend Cinephile Mike was at both the 9am press screening AND the midnight madness screening, so I'm gonna pass you over to him for a brief moment as he tells what that was like, take it away Mike\n--6/10 for the Toxic Avenger, totally bonkers, ultra violent at times, very much tongue in cheek if a little unsure of itself tonally at times.There IS an end credits scene so be sure toi stick around for that, and If you wanna see my thoughts on other films from the Edinburgh film festival, you can click here.",

The storyline follows a widowed single dad raising his stepson who learns from his doctor that he has only six months to a year to live. Desperate for help, he turns to the owner of his company for treatment but is rejected, setting him on a path of revenge, transformation, and vengeance.This film is directed by Macon Blair (I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore) and stars Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones), Kevin Bacon (Friday the 13th), Elijah Wood (The Lord of the Rings), Taylour Paige (Zola), and Jacob Tremblay (Doctor Sleep).This movie gave me exactly what I wanted. It has the perfect blend of Hobo with a Shotgun and Class of Nuke 'Em High. I was glad it wasn't a straight remake but instead took the story in a fresh new direction. The characters, setting, and premise pull you right into its universe, delivering that gritty mix of grindhouse, horror, comedy, and sci-fi that you expect from a Toxic Avenger / Troma Entertainment production.The acting hits the right notes, the storyline has more depth than expected, and the villains are perfectly over the top. The special effects shine with a great mix of practical work and CGI-the opening \"arm\" sequence, the Miss Meat Dinner scene, every battle with \"Killer Nuts,\" and the climactic showdown gave me everything I was hoping for. I also loved the opening narration, the animation, and of course, the soundtrack.If I had any complaints, I would have liked more from the transformation scene, and while some of the CGI was excellent, other moments felt uneven. Still, overall this film delivered exactly what I was looking for...and stay for the after credits.In conclusion, The Toxic Avenger is far better than it has any right to be-a fun, modern reimagining of a cult classic.

Much like this summer's The Naked Gun revival, Macon Blair's reboot of the cult classic knows exactly what it is and leans into it unapologetically. The result? A crude, raunchy, blood-soaked horror-comedy that never once apologizes for its absurdity and delivers the splatterfest fans have been craving.This fifth installment in the franchise-and a reimagining of the 1984 Troma classic-is every bit as outrageous as its predecessors but with a modern twist that blends old-school grindhouse charm with slick, updated filmmaking. There are tits, dicks, off-color jokes, and buckets of gore flying across the screen exactly what you'd expect from a Toxic Avenger movie, and then some. If you grew up on Lloyd Kaufman's wild, politically incorrect originals, you'll feel right at home. If you're new to Tromaville and more accustomed to the squeaky-clean tone of modern superhero flicks, buckle up. This one will either shock you or convert you.Peter Dinklage absolutely owns the role of Toxie. He brings heart, grit, and just the right amount of tragic hero energy to a character that could have easily slipped into pure parody. His journey taking on the evil BTH corporation, led by Kevin Bacon's vile Bob Garbinger. Bacon, for his part, is clearly having a blast as the sleaziest CEO imaginable, chewing up every scene with cartoonish villainy.The balance of practical effects and CGI is one of the movie's strongest points. The gore here is gloriously over the top but still tactile enough to keep that Troma DNA alive. Limbs fly, heads explode, and the screen is painted red in set pieces that rival some of the best splatter moments of the past decade. But what makes it work is that, underneath the carnage, there's still a story with heart, a hero who, despite his grotesque transformation, just wants to do the right thing.The humor is as sharp and unapologetic as ever. Blair doesn't try to sanitize the material to make it \"palatable\" for modern audiences. Instead, he embraces the outrageousness of the original films and turns it up a notch, creating a film that is self-aware without ever becoming self parody.The Toxic Avenger is a filthy, funny, and fantastically bloody good time. It's rare for a reboot to honor its source material while carving out its own identity, but Macon Blair and Peter Dinklage pull it off. Whether you're a lifelong fan of Toxie or a newcomer looking for something bold, brash, and completely insane, this one is not to be missed.",

His charisma drives the film's wild energy, and he leans into the absurdity with sharp wit, proving his acting chops even for those new to his work.The humor hits hard at times-like the outrageous concert scene packed with props straight out of Troma's playbook-but too many gags flop, leaving the comedy uneven. When it works, it's gold; when it doesn't, it drags the film down.Unfortunately, the second half loses steam with corny pacing and heavy-handed messaging that comes off preachy. The satanic, horned villain and his wife push the grotesque imagery too far, pulling you out of the fun as if the filmmakers got lost in their own weirdness.Dinklage's performance and a few comedic gems keep it from total collapse, but the sluggish pacing, inconsistent humor, and preachy undertones sink what could have been a wild ride.",

            "review": "The Toxic Avenger is a suitably gory and surprisingly funny low budget throwback to B-movies that's greatest strength comes from how consistently those jokes land. It updates the titular character for modern times effectively and is always moving quickly enough to remain a fun watch. The bad taste sensibilities are more than accounted for and it also has the required heart to be emotionally investing as well.Peter Dinklage gets things off to a strong start thanks to his heartfelt performance as a downbeat guy who just wants to be a good dad. Once he hands over the physical work to Luisa Guerreiro, they work well together so it still feels like one character. Kevin Bacon is the fun kind of pathetic villain and Elijah Wood similarly gets some laughs out of his eccentric character. Taylour Paige does the narrative heavy lifting as well as delivering solid jokes.Macon Blair's direction has a clear affection for this genre and when the smaller budget becomes visible it only adds to the charm. All the gore is fittingly bloody and gleefully over the top but it would've benefited from looking more practical overall. The occasionally snappy editing by Brett W. Bachman and James Thomas prevents the film from getting bogged down by the most common narrative tropes when they appear.",

Lili practically raised Valeria since their parents died when she was 18 and her sister was 10. To her surprise Valeria is engaged to marry a Frenchman named Manu and the two have not only spent Valeria's inheritance, but they want Lili to agree to sell their mother's property on the island and they just conveniently have a real estate agent who already has a buyer lined up.Meanwhile Lili meets Tom, a fellow German and bar manager. The two have instant chemistry...but the next day we discover there may be a more sinister story as the real estate agent approaches Tom about doing a job.I feel like the film is more of a story about an elaborate con than an actual thriller...but maybe I have been spoiled by some really good Nordic noirs that have set my bar pretty high for thriller (which just happens to be my favorite genre).I loved the setting, which was gorgeous. I thought the two leads were not only gorgeous but had smoking chemistry. I was a little creeped out about by Girasol and her bevy of young male seducers. Not really a crime where I am from, I think because most men on my island would be ashamed to take advantage of a woman in such a way.It's the height of summer and I could feel the heat in this film making it a summer recommendation from me. It's light and breezy like a cool mock tail and would be a fun (adults only as there is sex and nudity) summer film.My review is based on watching the film in it's original German language with English subtitles.",

            "review": "It's a familiar feeling for anyone who has braved the back catalog of German-produced Netflix thrillers: a sinking sensation that begins somewhere around the 5-minute mark, when you realize the only thing being strangled is the narrative, and the only suspense is whether the next line of dialogue will make less sense than the last.The core problem, and there are many, lies with a screenplay that seems to have been translated from a language not yet invented by humans. Characters exchange dialogue that feels less like a conversation and more like a series of non-sequiturs, each line a solitary island in an ocean of awkward silence. Talented actors, particularly the excellent Svenja Jung, do their best to inject some semblance of emotion into this narrative abyss, but it's like asking a concert pianist to perform a masterpiece on a broken kazoo. You can see the effort, but the result is a dissonant, painful mess. The titular \"thrills\" are non-existent, unless you count the heart-pounding tension of watching two people look at each other with vaguely troubled expressions for extended periods.This cinematic shipwreck is a stunning feast for the eyes. The film's DOP deserves a medal, or at least a better script. Every frame of Mallorca is a joy to watch. The golden-hour light bathing ancient stone villas, the impossibly blue waters of the Mediterranean, the serpentine roads carving through lush green hills-it's all a breathtaking advertisement for Spanish tourism.In the end, Fall for Me is a rare and peculiar beast. It is a film that is profoundly bad in almost every technical and creative way. It's the cinematic equivalent of a luxury car with no engine: it looks magnificent on the outside, but it won't take you anywhere you want to go. Watch it for the scenery, but be warned: the only thing you'll fall for is the island of Mallorca, and even that won't be enough to save your evening.",

You can also occasionally see where the green screen / digital backgrounds meet the physical set - particularly in the last act.

Movie relies too heavily on nostalgia and has constant cutaways to the original movie, which just made me wish I was watching the original instead.I know plot is not as important for a comedy, but man did I not like where the story went that much at all. I didn't like it went for Extreme golf, rather just stick to normal golf. But overall, the plot is still just mostly a cheap rehash of the original, but would be fine if the movie was actually funny, but it isn't. And the main driving force of the movie is super weak. He has to get huge money to send his daughter to a ballet school in Paris, problem is the daughter is boring and has no real personality so I don't really care if Happy accomplishes his goal or not. Unlike the OG, where the Goal was to make big money to get his Grandma's house back, and I cared WAY MORE about Happy's goal cuz they show a ton of times how much a sweetheart his Grandma is and how much she grounds Happy's character. So it makes you really want Happy to win! At one point his Grandma even says, \"it's okay, it's just a house, I just want you to be happy.\"I struggled so hard to finish this movie, it's 2 hours, which is extremely long from a comedy, and you really feel that length since it's not funny at all. It really made me just want to rewatch the OG again for the millionth time and pretend this sequel never happened.I think Adam Sandler just lost his comedy charm and energy. I don't blame him, he's just really old now. Click IMO was his last great comedy. Ever since, his schtick just grown more tired. This is probably Adam Sandler at his worst in a comedy movie. Even Jack and Jill while god awful, was kinda so bad it's good with some genuinely funny moments still, and Al Pacino wasn't half bad in it. I know it sounds crazy, but I would actually rather rewatch Jack and Jill than Happy Gilmore 2. Happy Gilmore 2 is just boring. It doesn't have the classic goofy vibe of his classic that you want to rewatch over and over and show your friends, ie Happy Gilmore OG of course, Billy Madison, Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates, Longest Yard, which IMO are the top 5 Comedy Adam Sandler movies.I know this may seem harsh, but he should just retire from comedy.

Some would even say the conjuring is one of the top horror films of all time. WAN found his niche within his created conjuring universe with the likes of these films, insidious, and all of the other spin offs. With this has come quite a few more filler movies from other directors that are much less experienced aside from (Whannell) at the helm. Michael Chaves is not a bad director by any means, but this simply does not hold a candle to the first two films or even the last one which was actually decently solid. This one just feels like the most uninteresting of the four and while it has a few decent demonic scares and visuals, it simply does not serve that much of a purpose other than a supposed ending. I actually do not think this will be truly the last of the conjuring films either, though I think it should've ended after the last one. I can think of at least three other films within the universe that aren't even great by any means, but are still more interesting than this. Annabelle Creation, The Nun, and even insidious 4 are all more effective . That's not to say this doesn't have a few redeeming qualities if you're a fan, but if it really was the end, Wan should've ended the Warren's story ...",

Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson shine brilliantly as Ed and Lorraine Warren, infusing their characters with an emotional depth and a palpable chemistry that has become iconic throughout the series.From the very first scene, the film immerses you in an eerie atmosphere, expertly crafted through stunning cinematography that captures the haunting essence of each haunting locale. The chilling sound design further elevates the experience, making every minor creak and whisper feel significant, creating an unshakeable sense of dread that will linger long after the credits roll.This installment is not just about jump scares; it weaves a rich narrative that blends horror with heartfelt moments, exploring the complexities of love, loss, and the courage to confront one's fears. As it wraps up the main saga, the film delivers a powerful and satisfying conclusion that ties together long-standing storylines and character arcs, leaving audiences both fulfilled and eager for what may lie ahead.For horror enthusiasts, this film is a must-watch-a cinematic experience best enjoyed in IMAX where the grandeur and intensity of the visuals and sound can truly be appreciated.

The setup had promise, but the movie just dragged until the halfway point. By then, I'd already checked my watch 2 times.The screenplay? Paper thin. Characters exist just to be spooked, and the scares are predictable jump-outs you can see a mile away. There's no tension, no atmosphere, just loud bangs and cheap tricks. At this point, you can practically set a stopwatch to when the next door will slam.And then there's Michael Chaves. Let's be real-this isn't his first stumble. La Llorona was weak. The Devil Made Me Do It barely felt like a horror movie. The Nun II was a snooze. And now here we are again, same bag of empty tricks. He confuses loud noises for scares and speed bumps for suspense. If James Wan built this house of horror with care, Chaves has turned it into a carnival ride running out of batteries.Who in their right mind thought that hey let's give the guy who delivered 3 trashes in a row another story to butcher? Perfect for a franchise closer.Sure, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga do their best, as always. Their chemistry still works, but they can't carry a whole movie on their backs.

Well that's very much the case with Ed and Lorraine Warren in this latest addition to The Conjuring franchise.What I initially assumed would be a fresh investigation sadly turns out to be more of the same formula we've seen over the past 10 years. There's little here that feels original; most of it either borrows heavily from previous entries or is clearly influenced by familiar tropes. A door left slightly open for the audience to notice... SLAM. A recording or photo reveals a ghostly figure. A quick camera cut - and boom, you're face-to-face with a demon.My biggest issue with the film is that it simply cannot stand on its own. It leans too heavily on paranormal figures the Warrens have battled before. Yes, there are creepy moments, the buildup often leads to little more than cheap jump scares.For a film with a runtime of 2 hours and 15 minutes - and a cast of 13 people and one dog - it plays things very safe. Sure there is suspense but, where is the danger? Who is the actual target? These are questions I found myself asking throughout the film.

It does stand apart, though, by leaning more heavily into story & character development than pure horror. I know many viewers will actually appreciate that approach, but for me, it came with a trade-off: because so much time was dedicated to the narrative, the multiple entities involved in the haunting didn't get as much screen time or presence as they could have. A tighter balance (slightly less story, more entity-driven horror) would've made it even stronger.That said, what's here is still excellent. The storytelling, while heavier, is well done & the film delivers some truly unique scare moments from the demons. It's a different flavour from earlier Conjuring entries, but it still holds that trademark mix of tension, atmosphere & supernatural dread.Overall, it's another very good addition to the franchise.

When you look at a film like The Exorcist from 1973, it roughly cuts fast, it is very slow paced for today's standards, the camera holds itself long, not many effects or anything, the whole horror is made by build-up and performances... it's the simple things. Lightning and Sound-Design are top tier and makes you feel unease. Here, we have so much of it, and it still feels flat. Why? Because they don't know how to CREATE and USE tension. It is a tool to boost emotional development of the characters. It is also a tool to increase our feeling of unease for example. And to anyone who says, The Exorcist was the first film and is hella old, they can't just redo that all the time, you don't get the point.Veronica, a Spanish horror film, made in I believe 2013, falls into this category of great reality-inspired horror. It is terrifying because it doesn't hold or loses its tension, it does neither of that. It just FLYS by, and what we care for, is her psychological well-being and the survival of his brother. We gotta care, and know that THESE characters aren't safe, these films don't play anymore with psychological fears of the human mind that are deeply rooted in our nature. Recently I watched and film from France, Spoorlos, or The Vanishing. Without context, there's a scene where a character lies in an tomb alive. That was scary and made me feel uneasy, it made me sick for minutes. Same with claustrophobic environments, they just want to scare us with LOUDNESS and unexpected things. And that is the main problem.There are a few scenes where that feeling gets transported, for example when someone looks around and see's a demon in silent darkness, or when someone suddenly starts to throw up glass and blood, these scenes are great, especially the second one catched me, but that is made by the performances of her and everyone standing beside her.Conjuring's Final isn't bad by any means, but It is so exaggerated in its simplicity of that makes sense. It's not bigger, it's not more intense, it's just overly-more exaggerated in the way it pays-off its scenario. The actual characters, especially the Main Cast, they deliver well and the chemistry of Lorraine and Ed is again what makes this film halfway good. I just think they're chemistry and love is perfect and felt through every scene of these films, especially in this one.I enjoy it for what It is, but looking back, the first Conjuring was something that still gave you shivers weeks after watching only by thinking about it...",

And, regrettably, that's the problem that plagues the second solo narrative feature outing from writer-director Ethan Coen. This pulpy comedy-drama-crime thriller, which follows the exploits of flamboyant, perpetually \"thirsty\" small town private detective Honey O'Donahue (Margaret Qualley) in her investigation of a series of unsolved murders apparently tied to mysterious church, successfully incorporates an array of truly captivating qualities - colorful character development, fine performances (particularly by Qualley and in the supporting portrayals of Aubrey Plaza, Chris Evans and Charlie Day), a well-crafted production design and a collection of knock-it-out-of-the-park one-liners. In fact, about the only thing that's missing here is a solid, comprehensible story. The picture's disjointed jumble of plot threads - many of them underdeveloped and/or extraneous - meanders along for roughly 90 minutes without ever really going anywhere or saying anything relevant or meaningful. To be sure, \"Honey Don't!\" has its share of genuinely enjoyable moments, but a handful of modestly memorable instances does not a movie make. And that's unfortunate, given that it seems the picture has many of the ingredients for what could have potentially been an outlandishly funny, wickedly engaging tale. Instead, viewers are left with a plot that aimlessly roams from tangent to tangent and never seems to coalesce into something substantial or integrated, no matter how visually appealing it might be or how effective it is in tickling one's funny bone. And, when the film comes up lacking in this regard, it often falls back on titillating sequences driven by graphic sexuality or edgy violence to shore up its obvious deficiencies, a rather cheap and cheesy way to try and revive sagging audience interest. In that sense, then, this production reminds me very much of the films of such directors as Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson, whose releases, in my view, are often long on style and woefully short on substance. I find all of this rather disappointing, especially in light of Coen's filmography over the years, particularly his many successful productions with his brother Joel. But perhaps that's the key ingredient that's missing here - the collaboration of the two siblings working together to produce truly outstanding works of cinema (and, thankfully, a reunion of the two is said to be in development). Whatever the case, though, it appears the filmmaker's sophomore attempt at working on his own has not yet yielded cinema of the caliber that he's capable of.

The usual dark humour is sorely lacking, the dialogue isn't as sharp, the script is a mess and the final pay-off is a major letdown.Indeed, only Qualley and Aubrey Plaza come out of the overly woke sexually charged Coen-carnage with any performance credibility, while a miscast Chris Evans and the rest of the supporting cast are as hollow and throwaway as the lacklustre screenplay.In truth, it's been far too long since either of the brothers have hit a 'HoF' homerun (No Country for Old Men in 2007!), and this is yet another strikeout for the undenable Hollywood legends who hardly put a foot wrong between 1984-2001!

This was a movie I was excited for since I'm a massive fan of the Coen Brothers, but it is sad for me to say this movie was just okay.Positives for Honey Don't (2025):\nThe movie does have an interesting premise of this young private investigator searching for the killer while also having to deal with a detective who refuses to believe that she is a lesbian. Margaret Qualley does a great job as Honey O'Donahue and she is one of the reason to watch this movie. I did enjoy the the supporting cast with Aubrey Plaza, Chris Evans, Charlie Day, Kristen Connolly, Billy Eichner, Gabby Beans and Talia Ryder. The main murder mystery is interesting at first with its ties to this church headed by Chris Evans. You still get that Coen western vibe that Ethan and his brother Joel have done very well together. And finally, there are some good action sequences that are decently bloody and I liked it.Negatives for Honey Don't (2025):\nThis movie barely has a story to tell to its audience. The movie feels like a series of events happening in order, but none of it lands right. The movie is too short to tell a story and it felt like Ethan Coen just wanted to make a lesbian movie without the story. And finally, Charlie Day got on my nerves as he refuses to accept that Margaret Qualley is a lesbian and I wanted to knock him out.Overall, Honey Don't is a serviceable enough detective movie with a great cast, but it falls short of what Ethan Coen is known for doing when he is at his best.",

            "review": "It's a send-up of a 1940s detective noir movie set in 2024 in and around Bakersfield, California. It follows Honey O'Donahue (Margaret Qualley), a lesbian private eye who comes upon a suspicious auto accident, which turns out to be the surface of a complex drug operation and a surprising serial killer. Honey's world includes her sister, Heidi (Kristen Connolly), her niece, Corrine (Talia Ryder), police detective Metakawich (Charlie Day), police officer MG Falcone (Aubrey Plaza), and Rev. Drew (Chris Evans), leader of the Four-Way Temple.\"Honey Don't\" includes many Ethan Coen earmarks--all the characters are eccentric, the setting is deliberately confusing with 1940s imagery mixed with 2024 imagery, and the plot jerks the viewer around multiple times. Thus, it's a fun watch for Coen fans, but it feels like the film wasn't fully baked. There are way too many loose ends, and it doesn't feel like a coherent whole at the end. Margaret Qualley is fine for her role; I wish it could have been more complete. Chris Evans provides the other memorable character.",

I found the movie to be very enjoyable.I have not seen Ethan Coen's previous film \"Drive away Dolls\". While not as brilliant as the Coen brother's best work like \"Barton Fink\" and \"No Country for Old Men\", I thought the film was very good, mostly because of the great performances by Margaret Qualley and the entire cast, including Chris Evans, Charlie Day, and Billy Eichner.

They completely delivered - it was the storyline, not the characters, that didn't add up. And look, while the coen brothers' breakup has blessed us with some spectacular sapphic scenes (hi, aubrey and margaret being absurdly hot together), it's also proof that his wife's touch might bring the spice but the boys really do their best work as a band of brothers.

From the creative opening credits that pay homage to both the story and the setting perfectly (and are so different to what is out there)...to the ending which left me craving more.When all was said and done I was bummed for the people that maybe didn't get it. And you wouldn't, if you haven't seen older films and didn't have a comprehensive understanding of older film genres.I don't want to give too much away, but I am SO happy I was able to see it in the theater. Margaret Qualley and Aubrey Plaza were fantastic (as were ALL the supporting characters). If one were to watch without knowledge of how film noir works, they may have thought that their characters were stoic and straightforward...but that's the point! They perfected an ART that has been lost. And if you don't believe me, just watch any Humphrey Bogart film, or something in a similar time period and prove me otherwise. And maybe people aren't used to a female playing a morally ambiguous character like that of a cold, matter-of-fact detective. That role was SUPPOSED to have a poker face and a tone with rare inflection. AND THEY DID! Perfectly. It was pure cinematic genius. It's called \"hardboiled detective fiction\" and they nailed it. I mean, if you've ever seen either of them in various roles you would know that this was out of the norm for their roles and likely not easy.The cheesy stereotypes, like the cheesy one-liner piano player and the creepy old dad were set off to highlight the main characters and perhaps why they are cold. That's intentional, and incredible.I don't want to give too much away, but this film is brilliant. The set decoration and secondary characters SCREAM Antelope Valley and Bakersfield area. It was beyond perfect.I really hope that people see the artistic license in this and there is a sequel. I rarely go to the theater these days and this one was beyond worth it.

Has as its main feature the quality of seeming to be tossed off by the director and writers/producers Ethan Coen and Tricia Cooke, as I am sure the latter and certainly the former has inhaled enough detective novels and movies and other forms of seedy pulp fiction to over-fill a small but sturdy bookstore and know the types and tropes in their bones.If it feels so loose even under 90 minutes that it even could feel like Coen and Cooke wrote this in a few heated days in a trailer in Bakersfield (or at least with some postcards from the city over their walls), that is a feature and not a bug; there is a sneaky confidence to the filmmaking as Coen is at the point after making films for so long that the \"plot\" doesn't matter so much as giving the actors some strange dialog to make as real as they can (and thus funnier). This and Drive-Away Dolls and, if it happens, the third movie in this unofficial Shaggy Lesbian-and-Liquor-and-Cigarette Soaked Neo-Noir trilogy are \"B\" level in what is on the page, and if it feels minor it is mostly because of the insanely high quality of work that Coen has in his Hard-Left-Turn Crime movies (and Cooke as well as co-editor on several films by the brothers).Thankfully, the filmmakers know how sharp Qualley looks in those heels and suits and understand what power she has as a beauty on screen but more importantly how adept she is at the Coen style of snappy patter that often moves into more serious connotations in the next scene or within the scene (the moment when her father comes a knocking straddles the line between funny and sad and is a perfect example of the amusing melancholy that laces many parts of the second half of this at least).There are also plum parts for a crude Chris Evans, nearly half of his performance half naked - he seems the most to me, for better or worse, like a character that could easily be in a Coen homage or even rip off (tell me he is not a spot on recurring character for the Fargo TV show) - and Aubrey Plaza, who gets to have such a wild monologue late in the film that it makes the turn into this moment justified (though barely, I'm still not sure how I feel about that without giving too much except that it does give a beat for a kind of critique of internalized misogyny maybe the film needed more time to unpack).Meanwhile, there is some terrific sensuality as well as absurd moments with that (easy pickings for comedy, sure, but still funny), and some horrific violence that shows that this late-era filmmaker can find new ways to make an audience curdle a bit from common household items in panic mode. I also liked the ways that just by flipping gender a bit we see certain tropes in a familiar but skewed light like with Billy Eighner's few scenes (the kind of actor who makes a full meal out of a school lunch worth of characterization). Again, I can't go to bat for this as something greater than what it is, and yet I think it is only trying to be as clever as it is and not much more. Honey Don't is a highly entertaining lark, no more or less.",

Instead of the raw, unpredictable energy of the original, we get a stitched-together plot straight out of an overused studio playbook: the reluctant hero juggling family troubles, a conveniently overpowered villain with no real depth, and a parade of \"unexpected\" allies who exist mostly to tick diversity boxes rather than drive the story.The marriage subplot is a slog - it stalls the pacing without adding emotional weight - and the mob fight arc is so generic you can almost predict each scene before it happens. Action sequences, once brutal and inventive, are now over-choreographed and sanitized, stripping away the dangerous, claustrophobic feel that made the first film memorable.By the time the credits roll, Nobody 2 feels less like a sequel and more like a bland studio imitation of its own original.

Part 1 could build up the moment where the audience and supporting characters find out who he is, but the franchise can't replicate that plot device in sequels. By Part 2, he's a Somebody.Still, though, the movie surpasses the original in 2 areas. Firstly, I think that the comedy in Part 2 surpasses the comedy in Part 1. There were numerous instances in Part 2 that legitimately had me laughing, and I'm not easy to please on comedy (e.g. I found the 2025 Naked Gun movie to be unfunny). To say what parts had me laughing might ruin those parts, so I won't say. Secondly, I think that Sharon Stone makes a better, more memorable antagonist than the Russian guy in Part 1.The movie's other positives are basically the same positives that apply to Part 1. Bob Odenkirk is a likable and charming protagonist. Though his role as Saul Goodman is iconic, you don't actually see Saul Goodman when you watch him in this movie; he occupies this role entirely. The movie blends the slick, intense action scenes with hilarious comedy in a way that neither clashes with the other or creates awkwardness. The compact 90-minute runtime is perfect. And I like Christopher Lloyd. We don't know how many more big-screen movies he'll appear in, so we should cherish themIn terms of flaws - the movie has a predictable plot; nothing here is really original or creative. And I don't imagine that many people, after watching, will remember this movie in the long-run. The movie builds up Sharon Stone's character, yet the protagonists take her out relatively easily.

Let me get my positives out the way I think Bob Odenkirk is fantastic as always and does another great performance playing Hutch and I love the direction this character is taking with a possible franchise happening ever. I also really enjoyed the family dynamic of the movie and how the family elements also play a big role in this movie like the first film as well and I really enjoy these moments. The action was also fantastic and there's some awesome action moments throughout the movie and this movie has some awesome choreography with some of the action scenes here in this film. I also think most of this movie has some great moments throughout its runtime and there's some good emotional moments as well. I think what makes this film lackluster a little is how many characters the movie tries to balance and we don't really get to see most of these characters do much and the movie just throws them to the side for majority of the film which isn't fun unfortunately as I wanted to see more character storylines in this. I also think the story is all over the place as well and there's some moments which make the movie feel a little dumb at times which I know this movie isn't doing anything too serious but there's some dumb plot lines in the movie. I also feel like this movie should've been longer as well as this movie literally flies by and just glances over some things which I wish they would've touched on more throughout the story and the writing is a little funky sometimes as well.

This sequel is directed by Timo Tjahjanto, known for The Night Comes for Us.Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) is still working as a hitman, a job that seems to have only gotten busier since his confrontation with the Russian mafia. When Hutch notices that the rest of his family could also use some relaxation, he decides to take them on a holiday to a vacation park he used to visit as a child.When Hutch and his family run into trouble there, he discovers that the park is run by corrupt criminals led by mafia boss Lendina (Sharon Stone). She sends her best people after Hutch and his family, unaware that Hutch himself has connections in the criminal underworld and even works for them.The first Nobody film was an entertaining action flick, essentially a standard action movie in the style of the John Wick films, but with Bob Odenkirk's own action style, which gave the film something unique. With this sequel, they attempt to mimic more of the atmosphere and action style of 1980s action movies. They succeed fairly well, which makes the film extra fun for fans of that kind of older action cinema.The action scenes, however, are often filmed with too much movement or zoomed in too closely, so you can't always clearly see what's happening. Sometimes you're asked to more or less fill in yourself how Hutch takes out his enemies, though you are given enough beforehand to guide you in a certain direction. This makes it seem like they played it a bit safer with the action this time around. The explosions also don't always come across as convincing. Despite these less clear and safer moments, it remains an enjoyable action movie.The story also stays on the safe side, meaning you can often predict what will happen and where the plot and action will ultimately lead. While Bob Odenkirk's character received help from his family in the first film, in part two this family assistance seems to have been expanded. As a result, the film can sometimes lose some of its focus. In addition to following Hutch, his wife and children also get extended screen time, but they don't always do anything important, which sometimes slows the pace.Bob Odenkirk still convincingly plays a hitman who takes out his enemies with his own style. This time, however, he sometimes has to unnecessarily share his screen time with the actors playing his family. It's still fun to see Christopher Lloyd in an action movie, although he unfortunately gets less screen time than in the first film. Still, he manages to deliver some comedic moments.The villains, unfortunately, come across as weaker this time. There is frequent switching between who is actually the real boss of the criminal organization. As a result, you spend more time with Lendina's subordinates than with her herself, making her less impactful as the final boss. She comes across more as someone who manages everything from behind the scenes, without you having spent enough time with her to really find her interesting.",

The pace is somewhat the same as the first, focusing a bit more on the fun than the first film. It's a comedy-centric film, the darker humor once more well-timed, presented, and crammed into every facet as Hutch faces yet another conspiracy hiding under his nose. I laughed a lot with the one-liners and the temper jokes, enjoying the slightly demented slice of life into an action scene that somehow feels a perfect poke against the one-man army genre. Nobody 2 maintains the charisma of the film, somehow keeping the wacky action, laughs, and depth decently present as we just go on a family vacation. It's a nice blend, still holding that entertainment factor, with performances that still feel just as raw and well-executed as I expected in the film. Character development isn't too bad, a nice little mini-dive into a new facet of our traumatized hero, this time bringing a new weakness into the mix to try and overcome to give Nobody's saga a little more dimension. Fortunately, it doesn't get in the way of the action, still blowing a gaping hole into the franchise with that stylish choreography that brings a video game's variety and edge to the big screen. Plenty of hand-to-hand combat and gunplay will light up the screen, and though there is some carnage and gore, Tiahianto's crew still manages to garnish it up to be manageable for all but the most squeamish stomach. Finally, the visual and audio elements come together to help add some theater-worthy elements to the film. The sound is very loud in this film, but it pulls you into all the chaos and does not apologize for all the explosive sound effects that they have in their arsenal. Nobody 2 also brings wicked visuals (as mentioned before) with a comical sheen to the action, and plenty of exciting sequences that bring our collector's assassin skills to new levels of chaos that seem to parody Wick's darker and more intense moves. Add in a killer soundtrack to mix things up, once again adding some flair to the moments, and Nobody 2 has once again proven to be a unique entry into this genre. If I had to summarize the likes in one sentence, it's that the film is just fun, another escape from reality that some movies fail to accomplish.DISLIKES:\nNeeds More Story\nMore RZA\nA Little More Comedy Balance\nBetter Villain\nNot Quite As Balanced\nMore Christopher Lloyd\nSummary:\nBeing the picky reviewer, the second movie still needed some more build-up to match what I loved in the first film so well. For one thing, I wanted a story again. I'll admit that the first movie's tale wasn't the biggest, mind-blowing piece to grace the theaters, but it had a little more logic, build, and development. Hutch's second journey focuses much more on the spectacle, leaving some of the storylines dangling with limited investment, exploration, or even purpose when they were cut so short. This is true for two of my other favorite characters, RZA and Lloyd's characters, who had a lot more punch in the first movie when Hutch gets pulled back into his career. We get a few snippets and some cool moments that push them into their inclusion, but I saw so much more potential with the characters than just shoving them into the background. Character utilization is quite less impressive for me, and I had hoped we could have had just that same integration in the past to help uncover this mystery. Sadly, the comedy antics and over-the-top action become the obsession, and that's where the film needs to tone it back to strike that balance I liked so much more in the first installment. In addition, a better villain could have saved the day as well. Our newest villain feels in line with the new direction, but outside of an aggressively foul mouth, some wicked style, and exaggerated dancing worthy of a new TikTok dance craze...she kind of is a laughable villain who did little but bring some great lines to the movie, I found to be the most clever. There is plenty of enjoyment in the film, don't get me wrong on that, but again, there is some balance, time expansion, and a little more planning needed to help rein in the ridiculous meter in a bit.The VERDICT:\nI had a lot of fun with the second movie and found this film to be exactly what the trailers promised it would be: a movie theater blast. It's all about the pizazz of the series, bringing over-the-top fights and comedy that will appeal to those with a sense of humor geared to darker themes. It moves fast, keeps the laughs up, and keeps the temper-driven antics in full throttle, yet keeps the violence and tone light enough with the satire to help buffer things. With great visuals and audio support and plenty of moments to laugh at, the sequel accomplishes much for being that fun night out to kill some time and break free from the stresses of the world. However, the movie is a step down from the first film, still shying away from the balance with characters, story, action, and comedy out of sync that I think needed a little more planning. While I never expected this to be the Oscar-worthy story or movie, I had hoped for the same level of development the first held, and that's not quite there. Thus, go there knowing you are going to be exposed to just an overly silly cinematic piece that is just fun and stupid to watch. Worth the theater visit? I think so, mainly for the fun and visual/audio aid. My scores are:\nAction/Comedy/Crime/Thriller: 7.5\nMovie Overall: 6.5-7.0.",

Feels like one of those routine sequels where they think \"Bigger! Louder! More explosions!\" will do the trick. Sure, there's more baddies with meaner faces, beefed-up action set pieces, and enough pyrotechnics to light up Blackpool, but the plot's only so-so.The stakes? Barely tickled me nerves-never quite got that \"edge of your seat\" buzz. The comedy's alright in dribs and drabs, but it's hardly side-splitting. On the bright side, it's got a decent bit of family warmth woven through, but you can see every twist coming a mile off. Predictable as a cuppa at four o'clock.Still, if you've got nothing better to do, it's a passable ride for an evening-just don't expect the freshness or spark of the first one.",

This time, Bob Odenkirk's Hutch Mansell is on vacation, which of course becomes a backdrop for an insane series of creatively staged, over-the-top fight sequences. Tjahjanto, known for his work on action films like The Night Comes for Us, brings a distinct, stylized flair to the violence, turning the tranquil setting of a small town and an amusement park into a series of deadly playgrounds. The plot is thin and largely exists to string together these incredible set pieces, but that's not a criticism-the movie knows exactly what it is. It's a joyful, unpretentious action romp. The action is more outlandish and even more graphic than the original, with a dark, cartoonish sense of humor that differentiates it from the more grounded, noirish tone of the first film.Some critics have noted that the sequel loses some of the original's gritty charm in favor of a more comedic, outlandish style, but praise the film for being an entertaining and satisfying follow-up.Is it worth watching? If you're a fan of the first film and are looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, then absolutely.",

What you get instead is a sharp, quietly melancholic study on modern love, dating, and loneliness in the big city. It's not so much about romance as it is about emotional bankruptcy - the way ambition, money, and appearances slowly chip away at real connection.The story follows Lucy, a matchmaker who views relationships like transactions, caught between two opposites: Harry, rich and polished, and John, her sweet but struggling ex. But the real tension isn't between them - it's in her. What does she actually want? Love, comfort, validation? Or just a life that looks good on paper?Celine Song's style is unmistakable - lingering shots, dialogue that feels like internal monologue, and a quiet ache humming underneath it all. At times, it almost felt like watching a late-era Woody Allen film - not in tone, but in that subtle, creeping sense of urban melancholy. By the end, I didn't feel uplifted. I felt... thoughtful. A bit heavy, even.This is a film about the emotional numbness that sneaks in when we live our lives through filters - digital and otherwise. About the loneliness hiding behind perfect apartments and curated dating profiles. And how love (or at least the idea of it) gets commodified without us even noticing.Not a rom-com. Not really even a romance. More of a character study. A mood piece. A quiet critique. And once I let go of what I thought it was meant to be, I found I really liked it, and I hope you do too.",

She lived the life of walking around asking people \"hey are you single?\" So naturally, she and I were excited to see this movie. While there were a few nods to the common (and hilariously ridiculous) issues that matchmakers deal with and some all-too-relatable moments for my wife, we were ultimately very disappointed.1) I'll avoid spoilers, but essentially the messages sent by this movie to all the single people out there are depressing and incredibly shallow.2) For a movie called \"Materialists\" that makes references to money consistently throughout, there was a shocking lack of eye candy in the film. Dinner scenes showed no food. Fancy homes were decorated by a beige monster. Not even travel porn.3) I'm a fan of Dakota in general, but wow this is a stale performance. She's monotone and lacks any chemistry with the main characters. They interact as if she has a restraining order against them in real life but already signed up to do the movie together.4) Everything. Is. So. Slow. The character's speak at a snail's pace. They also don't have conversations. Instead, they take turns reciting long monologues to each other. Scenes are drawn out in order to create drama and the soundtrack must just be a Pandora station called \"Melodramatic Elevator Music.\" For a movie that centers around human connection, the main characters interacted like they were written by AI.The marketing/pr for the film made it seem like this was going to be light, airy, and more of a rom-com.

These actors, even Johnson, were done a disservice being pulled into such a poor performance.None of the three main characters are strongly likable, and so I was left wandering through this mess of a movie not caring what even happened to them in the end.

I'm happy to say that this film was incredible and also depressing in a way as well which left me in a state of sadness as I actually almost cried at this movie and I won't lie to you I was super close to doing so. I found myself to really love and relate to the direction this film took in exploring modern dating and how as a society we've set such high standards for dating and that we need our partners to check off certain lists so we can be \"happy\" instead of finding true love and caring for someone due to who they truly are and not based off some stuff on a checklist making real love near impossible to find for most people now. The film makes a really strong point on how we should love our partner for who they are. There's some really emotional and gut wrenching moments in this film as well especially with our main leads with Dakota Johnson who delivered a phenomenal performance and Chris Evans who was also fantastic in this film as well. I really loved these emotional moments throughout the movie and there's one scene with Pedro Pascal's character which really stood out to me and was really emotional. I enjoy the visuals in this movie as well and there's some really great cinematic shots throughout this movie as well which elevated this movie even further up for me. I wish they could've explored Dakota Johnson and Chris Evan's previous relationship in this film some more and I would've enjoyed to see some more backstory for Chris Evans character in this movie.

Or maybe she has, but the strict conditions she places on relationships may have kept her from realizing it. When she meets a man who seems to check every box, she's forced to ask herself: is she about to make a mistake, and is true love more important than her carefully curated criteria?The film is written and directed by Celine Song (Past Lives) and stars Dakota Johnson (Fifty Shades of Grey), Chris Evans (Captain America), Pedro Pascal (Game of Thrones), Zoe Winters (Succession), and Marin Ireland (Homeland).From the opening scene, it's clear the film is pushing a familiar message and the storyline is highly predictable-you'll likely see every plot turn coming. That said, it does offer some thoughtful reflections on successful men's outlook on dating, the difficulties older women encounter in dating, and the universal longing for companionship. It also explores how rigid expectations in relationships can sometimes become barriers to genuine happiness.In conclusion, The Materialist presents some fun situations and sincere themes, but ultimately feels a bit contrived.

            "review": "It can be hard for a playwright to transition into filmmaking. Plays are famously staid, physical affairs, relying more on dialogue than visual storytelling to convey emotion and plot. Yet Celine Song has made the leap from playwright to filmmaker with a visual fluency and ease that's nothing short of remarkable. Her feature debut Past Lives (2023) became an indie darling, earning an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay. While its dialogue was crisp and lyrical, it was Song's command of silences and glances that gave the film its emotional resonance. She now follows that impressive debut with Materialists (2025), a quasi-rom-com that strikes while the iron is hot.Materialists follows Lucy (Dakota Johnson), a New York City matchmaker who views dating through the lens of a financial market-assigning value to men and women based on traits, assets, and compatibility metrics. She doesn't pretend love is purely romantic; she's practical, even transactional. But her worldview is tested when she begins dating Harry (Pedro Pascal), a charming and wealthy suitor, just as John (Chris Evans), a struggling actor and former flame, reappears and rekindles an effortless chemistry.Song appears especially drawn to love triangles-Past Lives also revolved around a woman caught between two worthy men. But she never reduces her characters to reality-TV archetypes or rom-com clichés. If anything, Materialists functions as an elevated romantic comedy: it still follows familiar narrative beats, but with a more grounded and honest exploration of love than the dreamy worlds of Meg Ryan or Richard Curtis films.Materialists dives into the realities of modern dating, where apps and algorithms have turned people into commodities in a vast \"dating market.\" Lucy's profession as a matchmaker becomes a narrative device for discussing these themes-her conversations with co-workers mirror the cold calculus behind dating app algorithms, where potential partners are treated like stocks or securities. Boxes are ticked, and wealth is a major factor-no romanticism required. Yet the film avoids becoming a cynical screed about the death of love. Instead, it confronts the tensions head-on: true love can feel \"easy,\" but that doesn't eliminate the realities of trade-offs, or the fact that marriage remains a financial partnership as much as a romantic one.This sociological bent makes Materialists fascinating to watch-it often feels more like a relationship essay than traditional entertainment. Still, it delivers the genre's essential pleasures: there are satisfying beats and feel-good moments, but with sharper dialogue and more originality than usual. Some lines recall early Richard Curtis in their memorability. Song's playwriting background serves her well here.Returning to the love triangle structure, Song treats each character with empathy, resisting the urge to vilify one in favor of a tidy moral. All three are endearing but imperfect, and their emotional depth makes you want to spend more time with them. This is especially true of the two men. Pascal finally lands the romantic lead that the internet has long wanted for him-his charm and sly smile are irresistible, and he carries a late, vulnerable scene with deft dramatic control. Evans, a rom-com veteran, leans into a quieter, more melancholic role. His longing and quiet devotion to Lucy-despite her questionable treatment of him-are convincingly portrayed.The weak link is Lucy herself. As the titular \"materialist,\" she's meant to evolve from pragmatic matchmaker to romantic lead, but she remains frustratingly underwritten. Johnson, whose signature style often leans toward aloof detachment, doesn't help. There's little insight into Lucy's inner world or motivations. She's burdened with being both the audience's point of entry and the character undergoing the biggest arc-yet the script and performance don't give her enough complexity to support that dual role. As a result, the film's emotional center feels muted.Ultimately, Materialists is a worthy, if slightly uneven, follow-up to Past Lives. It doesn't linger in the soul the way Song's debut did, but it plays with the rom-com form in thoughtful, compelling ways. With sharp dialogue, a probing thesis, and two richly drawn male leads, it elevates the genre's average. Still, when your central character-the fulcrum of both the romance and the film's thematic weight-feels undercooked, one of the film's key pillars noticeably wobbles.",

Finally, after a bunch of okay, mediocre and awful adaptations tackling Mary Shelley's gothic science fiction horror epic, Guillermo del Toro gets to have his vision fully realized in what's easily one of the most faithful adaptations ever made while still being his own film.The visuals are phenomenal, the acting is outstanding all around (although Isaac and Elordi are the standouts), Guillermo's writing and direction are steadfast and intimately visceral, the music is haunting, and the cinematography is some of the best of the year. I will be seeing this again in theaters, but I hope Netflix sits down and let's this epic go to IMAX. That would be one hell of an experience.",

The man doesn't make movies-he engineers experiences. This one? A contemporary western that hums with unease, like a desert wind carrying whispers of something off.Aster's got a reputation for unsettling audiences, but here he trades pagan rituals and family trauma for the sun-bleached nihilism of New Mexico. The tension isn't in the jump scares-it's in the silence between glances, the way a sheriff's badge catches the light just a little too sharply. His camera lingers like a vulture circling, and the editing? Tight. No wasted movement. You'll feel every minute of its 148 runtime, but not because it drags. Because it grinds.Joaquin Phoenix as the sheriff? He's all coiled ambition and swallowed rage, a man who's mastered the art of smiling without it touching his eyes. Emma Stone? She's in her element here, shifting from warmth to withering skepticism like a switchblade flicking open. And Pedro Pascal-quiet, calculating, a performance that says more in a raised eyebrow than most do in monologues.If you're expecting another Midsommar, adjust your sights. This is a different breed-a dark comedy dressed in cowboy boots, where the jokes land like gut punches. The humor's bone-dry, the violence matter-of-fact, and the existential dread? Oh, it's there. Lurking in the background like a bad habit you can't quit.Is it perfect? No. The third act's ambition occasionally outpaces its grip, and not every metaphor sticks the landing. But perfection's overrated. Eddington's a ride-a nasty, hypnotic, memorable ride. Aster's not asking you to like it. He's daring you to look away.My advice? Don't.",

In the early 1900s, a newspaper reportedly asked a group of notable writers and thinkers to respond to the question, \"What is wrong with the world today?\" To which the famous theologian and thinker G. K. Chesterton is said to have replied with a characteristically witty and humble response \"Dear Sirs, I am. Yours sincerely, G. K. Chesterton.\"Ari Aster has made another horror film. This one is disguised as a modern day Western, Dark Comedy, but this is deep diving stuff that inserts us into a small New Mexico town in 2020 that is at the beginning stages of the COVID pandemic. Joaquin Phoenix is the tour guide - and the ride - who shows us something of what is wrong with the world.Eddington took me back to feelings of despair that play on in our world. This is a most excellent tragic tale and definitely not a comedy, although the audience will probably laugh in the discomfort of seeing the true reflection of ourselves somewhere in this mirror of blame, conspiracy, narcissism, and social rage.Somehow Aster keeps this from being preachy while giving us a scare at our own reflections.

It's a macrocosom of events that impacted the US but obviously ramps them up to 11.I appreciate the craft and the film was at its best when it was reminiscent of the Coen's No Country For Old Men. The 2nd act elevated the implemented satire to a contemporary western crime thriller.The film is hit or miss in its summary.

The trailer promises a stylish neo-Western satire set against the surreal and emotionally charged backdrop of 2020's pandemic-era America. You've got a stacked cast, a topical setup, and the unique flavor of Ari Aster's direction. On paper, this thing had all the ingredients to be one of the year's best. But what we actually get is a film so self-indulgent, bloated, and exhausting, that by the time the movie gets to anything resembling what you saw in the trailer, two hours have passed-and it feels like you've aged an entire year.The story is solid, buried somewhere under the relentless mountain of symbolism, surrealist detours, and exhausting monologues. Joaquin Phoenix, as always, acts his ass off. Pedro Pascal and Emma Stone deliver committed performances, and there are moments...\nbrief moments... of biting satire and darkly funny commentary. But they're drowned under an avalanche of who gives a damn, just get to the damn point.The pacing is brutal. Every time the film seems like it's found a natural stopping point-every time you brace yourself for the sweet release of credits-it starts again. And again. And again.Eddington wants to be everything: a Western, a dark comedy, a political satire, a COVID-era meditation, a psychological thriller. The result is a disjointed, genre-hopping mess. By the end, the film doesn't leave you stunned or speechless-it leaves you drained, begging for it to just end already.Eddington might work for die-hard Aster fans and film school debaters, but for the rest of us, it's a test of endurance-not entertainment, and after this, I'll be cutting my grass with scissors before I sit through another Ari Aster film.",

            "review": "Eddington (2025) - Ari AsterWow! Where do I even begin?When scrolling on Instagram a while ago, I saw a short reel of Ari Aster talking after this film premiered at the Cannes film festival. Once the applause died now, I believe his first words were \"sorry, I guess?\" I do not know the quote verbatim, but he jokingly apologized for the film. It is easy to see the need for an apology just an hour into the film. Eddington is riddled with politics, controversy, violence, and surprisingly, some of the best dark humor I have ever seen in cinema. We finally have a fictional movie that truly addresses tensions in America during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is one hell of a movie.Meet Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix), the sheriff of Eddington. He may not want to wear a mask everywhere he goes (and claims it is due to asthma), but that does not make him a bad person. Not yet, at least.And meet the current mayor of Eddington, Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal). He reminds Joe that there is a mandate in place to wear a mask in public, but at least he is polite about it while reminding Joe that it is just a safety precaution.The first hour of the movie pokes fun at such behavior from both sides of the issue, which is a very bold thing to do only five years after the timeline in which this story takes place. But this is just a precursor to how tensions will quickly escalate from more serious issues, both political and personal, once the first act ends with Cross announcing his run for mayor of Eddington.Now, while I would likely not agree with Cross' behavior towards COVID if I was back in 2020 when the movie takes place, Cross has noble, and understandable, qualities such as wanting to treat everybody more like human beings than like toddlers during uncertain times. Is he a conservative since he dismisses COVID? Well... who cares? It does not matter what side of the political spectrum he falls on, but the important thing is while some see him as selfish, to others he is a kind and caring human being.At first.One thing that the movie does very well is that while it brings up political divide and tensions which were happening in 2020, it attempts to remain unbiased, showing both the good stuff and the bad stuff coming from each \"side.\" There is a lot of first amendment auditing in the movie, but before videos get posted to Instagram, it is shown in the movie that a lot of what actually makes it to the social media platform is taken completely out of context. Even minor subplots are filled with notions that certain biases definitely exist through manipulation of technology and the use of social media.This review may not feel complete, but I think I have to stop myself here before I begin to spoil anything about the second half of the movie. But I will leave you all with this... I think Phoenix's performance is incredible in this film because there is a \"point of no return\" moment in which I decided that Joe Cross becomes one of the worst fictional human beings I have ever seen portrayed on film.I am not going to say this movie will not offend you, because there is a great chance that it will, but I think this film needs to be seen. It is controversial and hilarious, and I also think it challenges me to think about the world and try to remain less biased and more understanding of opposing points of view.10/10.",

            "review": "Describing Eddington as a neo-western might be the most fitting way to summarise Ari Aster's 2025 dark comedy-drama-though even that hardly scratches the surface.That said, I felt I needed a full ten minutes of silence after the credits rolled, just to process what I'd witnessed.It's an Ari Aster film, after all, so if you're familiar with his work, you'll know to expect a whirlwind of emotional and thematic disarray. But Eddington isn't just messy-it's exquisite, unfiltered chaos.If you've seen the trailer, don't be misled. It barely teases the disorienting spiral that unfolds. The story kicks off in May 2020, amidst the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.What begins as a snapshot of public hysteria-conspiracy theories, anti-vaxxers, and the fear-soaked atmosphere-rapidly morphs into something darker and more disturbingly real.We've spent the past five years collectively unmoored-adrift in chaos, where appearances deceive and identities dissolve. It sometimes feels like a failed social mutation-one born from freedom pushed to its breaking point-an evolutionary misstep we fought to achieve, only to have it turn against us.Let's be clear: freedom is a vital human right. But when it becomes indistinguishable from anarchic self-destruction, something has clearly gone awry.At its core, Eddington follows a standoff between small-town sheriff Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix) and Mayor Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal), set in the fictional town of Eddington, New Mexico.Their clash is both personal and political-complicated by Garcia's fraught history with Cross's wife, Louise (Emma Stone), and mother-in-law, Dawn (Deirdre O'Connell).Aster revisits his obsession with overbearing maternal figures, folding that tension seamlessly into the wider conflict as the two men find themselves on opposing sides of the mask debate.The film is deliberately provocative, often hollow by design, and it's a difficult piece to review. You'll laugh, you'll wince, you'll question what you're watching-and you certainly won't find it comforting.Aster touches on themes like racial division, though arguably without much new to say. The Black Lives Matter movement is clearly present in the film's DNA, but its representation feels muddled-more gestured at than fully explored.Before it can fully engage with those ideas, the film veers off into another subplot filled with irrationality, violence, and distraction-perhaps intentionally mirroring how public attention shifted in real time.What he does capture is the paranoia, anxiety, and social fragmentation that exploded when lockdowns began and the world collectively panicked. He blends it into a fever dream of confusion and satire, offering no answers-just raw sensation.Much of the chaos is filtered through the lens of social media, which becomes the film's true stage. It's where the news is curated, where lies take root, and where misinformation thrives.To emphasize this aspect, the film extensively employs the screenlife technique, blending traditional storytelling with found-footage and mockumentary styles. And let me tell you, it works remarkably well, enhancing the overall sense of realism.Paranoia spreads like wildfire, jokes mutate into threats, and morality dissolves into a game of psychological warfare, disinformation, and mass manipulation.Unsurprisingly, Eddington has sharply divided critics-and will likely do the same with audiences. Expect fiery debates. Some will praise its fearless ambition; others will dismiss it as bloated, incoherent, or pretentious. And honestly, that may be exactly what Aster intended.As always, his visual storytelling is exceptional. Darius Khondji's cinematography (Uncut Gems, The Immigrant) balances the film's absurdity and dread with a sharp, immersive eye. Lucian Johnston's editing keeps the pacing surprisingly taut, especially for a film that thrives on disorientation.Aster's visual language for violence remains as potent as ever. When revenge time comes, it hits with darkly funny moments-especially during 'The Antifa Massacre,' which delivers shocking laughs and gory satisfaction in true Ari Aster fashion.But after all that-did I like it?There's brilliance in Eddington-but perhaps brilliance trapped in a maze of its own ambition, leaving something essential just out of reach.The ride remains undeniably compelling. Ari Aster remains one of the most fascinating directors working today.But, as with Beau Is Afraid, he tests the limits of narrative and patience. There's brilliance in Eddington, but there's also a sense of something missing-maybe too much of everything, all at once.This isn't a comfort film to watch. It won't leave you with a clear head. In fact, you'll probably leave the cinema clutching your skull, trying to piece together the fragments.My advice? Watch it with a good friend-or a few-who appreciate psychologically demanding cinema.Because once the screen fades to black, the real film begins-in your head, and in the conversations that follow.",

            "review": "Ari Aster's Eddington is a feverish, kaleidoscopic descent into the American psyche during the COVID-19 pandemic-a film that aspires to be a modern Dr. Strangelove but often resembles a fever dream in a funhouse mirror. Set in a fictional New Mexico town, it follows Sheriff Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix) as he spirals into political and personal chaos, clashing with Mayor Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal) amid a backdrop of mask mandates, conspiracy theories, and societal unraveling.Aster's ambition is palpable, weaving a tapestry of political satire, dark comedy, and surreal horror. The film's visual style, marked by stark contrasts and unsettling imagery, mirrors the disorienting nature of the pandemic era. Phoenix delivers a performance that oscillates between manic energy and tragic vulnerability, capturing the essence of a man undone by his own delusions.However, Eddington often falters under the weight of its own ambition. The narrative, overstuffed with themes ranging from political polarization to performative activism, lacks the coherence necessary to deliver its message effectively. While Aster critiques both the far-right and the performative left, the film's satire occasionally veers into cynicism, offering little in the way of nuanced commentary.The film's pacing suffers as well; its 145-minute runtime feels bloated, with sequences that drag and moments that seem indulgent rather than essential. The tonal shifts-from dark comedy to horror to political allegory-can be jarring, leaving the audience disoriented rather than enlightened.In the end, Eddington is a film that strives for profundity but often settles for spectacle. It is a cinematic reflection of internet outrage, a mirror held up to a society in turmoil, but one that sometimes obscures more than it reveals. While it offers moments of insight and flashes of brilliance, it ultimately falls short of its lofty aspirations.5/10. Expected a lot more.",

In 2025, Ari Aster has departed from that stereotype and is now seen (at least in my opinion) as a director who makes very polarizing and ambitious films that he wants to make. I gotta respect the guy for going out and doing that. Eddington, much like his 2023 film \"Beau is Afraid\" is that kind of film. It's ridiculously ambitious, busy, and absolutely bonkers. It's something that I feel only Aster could make. I'll agree with the critics when they say Aster covers a lot of subjects but doesn't really commit to most of them. He seems to kind of get lost in the moment of trying to satirize and summarize too many subjects of the COVID pandemic to the point of exhaustion.

The ever busy Pedro Pascal and always adventurous Joaquin Phoenix are great as Mayor and Sheriff at political odds in the tiny town of Eddington, New Mexico (really Truth or Consequences) with mask restrictions that drove many a citizen crazy in 2020-1 (the plot only seems a bit of an overreach by conflating AI into the mix, an issue that really didn't enter the national conversation until late 2022 at the earliest). Emma Stone is very funny as Joaquin's doll-obsessed, frigid wife, and the film has a charming, homespun quality that recalls other New Mexico-set films like \"Welcome To Mooseport\" and \"White Sands\" (I tried to be an extra when it filmed a year ago this past April but missed the window, finding only \"Welcome Eddington!\" marquees at various drive-ins). With NM's usually vibrant film scene slowed to a snail's pace due to tariffs and such (Superman was essentially fighting a fitter, younger Don), it's great we still have challenging, well-written films like this emerging in 2025 among all the usual play-it-safe remakes and reboots.

            "review": "So, what does dark comedy mean, exactly ... ?\"Eddington,\" which falls under that genre on the Internet Movie Database, isn't the first movie that's left me asking the question. It's just the most recent.The film is also labeled a Contemporary Western, a concept easier to grasp.Eddington is the name of a tiny, out-of-the-way New Mexico town, grappling - as the rest of the country was when the story opens in 2020 - with the outbreak of the Covid pandemic.You can't get much more contemporary than that.Written and directed by Ari Aster, who has developed a cult following for leading audiences into scary sometimes gross places, its cast is heavy with Oscar winners and nominees. Joaquin Phoenix, Emma Stone, Pablo Pascal, Dierdre O'Connell, Michael Ward and Austen Butler, for openers.Phoenix plays Eddington's Sheriff Joe Cross, a sad-sack lawman who's got about as much as he can handle with his wife Louise (Stone) who doesn't love him ; her mother Dawn (O'Connell) whose favorite pastime is Googling conspiracy theories; and that Covid mask mandate that he's supposed to be enforcing.Joe's got asthma, you see, which makes it hard for him to breathe whenever he tries to put the danged mask on.Joe's not a political person, per se. The circumstances that lead him to run against incumbent Ted Garcia (Pascal) to become Eddington's mayor are more a matter of being pushed past his breaking point by one too many matters beyond his control.There's the new AI data center that's been proposed for development that has local conservationists up in arms. There's the George Floyd killing in Minneapolis that's all over the news and has the town's teenage population rioting on Main Street. There's the loco crazy homeless guy, who always shows up to make matters worse. There are the rumors that the current mayor slept with Sheriff Joe's wife, before unceremoniously dumping her ...\nAha, so maybe dark comedy is about trying to find the yuks in what Henry David Thoreau called \"lives of quiet desperation.\" That was the way Thoreau described \"the mass of men\" in his 1854 masterpiece \"Walden.\" No one has summed things up better in the almost two centuries since.Or maybe dark comedy is more a matter of dystopian satire, trying to whistle our way past the graveyard of civilization.Whatever it's called, writer-director Aster clearly has a lot on his mind before he lets the action onscreen devolve into a hail of unholy gunfire, explosions and chaos in the third act.Considering that they're both running for mayor, it's noteworthy what horrible communicators Sheriff Joe and incumbent Ted Garcia are. Joe has a habit of speaking his mind before his mind's made up. Ted is way better in TV commercials than in actuality. Both guys reveal the absence of anything like actual confidence every time they open their mouths.The real powers in their world are behind the scenes, creating that water-sucking, resource-depleting high-tech data center, or infiltrating high-minded political demonstrations with false flag mercenaries\nLike an old-fashioned - as opposed to contemporary - Western, \"Eddington's\" setting is as much a character as the characters are. The saloon, church and wooden sidewalks may now be replaced with convenience marts, an historic Indian museum and a very convenient gun and ammo store, but there's still the sense of flimsy storefronts standing lonesome vigils a long way from the hills on the horizon on those windswept plains.Likewise, Sheriff Joe's iPhone isn't in the credits, but it play a role as important as any character in the story. \"Eddington\" may be the first work of art made of misinformation. Social media is where that misinformation comes to life, festers and spreads like fungus. There's nothing like smart technology for making people stupid. Once you create artificial intelligence, actual intelligence is a flimsy defense indeed.When it comes to polarized idiocy, filmmaker Aster doesn't take sides. The self-styled high-minded liberals are as gullible to online fictions as your standard garden-variety bigot. Some of the film's funniest scenes come when the teen demonstrators protesting the George Floyd killings tie themselves in moral knots trying to deny their own class and privilege. Aster's script suggests that actual pedophiles may far outnumber figments of conspiracy theory imagination - and may not be limited to one political party or another.\"Eddington\" may be a work of genius. That's a saving grace, considering that none of its characters are particularly likable, it's disquieting to sit through, and its so-called humor hardly lightens the mood as you exit the theater into the actual dystopia waiting outside.",

In the end, I did not like this filmAs usual, I'll begin first with what I actually liked. I feel that the film, particularly in the opening portions, offers some evocative commentary about 2020 society, with Covid and race-riots. For example, the movie has one scene where a supermarket rigidly enforces COVID protocols, and the people indoors look so silly when they follow certain rules, such as walking through aisles only in the direction of the arrows on the ground . The movie pokes fun at both sides, yet it still captures how foolish and even insane the world became at the time.I also like the opening back-and-forth exchanges between Pedro Pascal and Joaquim Phoenix, which occur early in the movie. Phoenix, in particular, shows some good acting. I give the movie some credit for it's portrayal of this nondescript small-town in New Mexico; the town of Eddington seems like a character itselfBut as I said -- I did not like this movie overall. The movie is slow, dry, and plodding; it's not fun to watch. A lot of the scenes contain fluff. None of the characters are likable and fun to watch. The overall vibe gets a bit too downcast at times. By the 1 hour and 15-minute mark, I was ready for this movie's story to wrap up. Instead, there was an hour to go.The scenes with Emma Stone's character are a drag. Honestly, I have no clue what the deal is with her character. Likewise, Austin Butler appears in one scene that is so vague, boring, and tedious. When his scene ended, I found myself wondering what in the world I just watched. It was as if the film just wanted to cram an Austin Butler cameo for whatever reason. Perhaps they just wanted to boast that an Oscar-nominee is in the film, or they wanted to use his name/image for marketingLastly - the film goes a bit off-the-rails at the end, almost changing genres entirely. I found it to be awkward, uneven, and too drawn-out. It felt more like like they tacked on some other's movie's ending to this one.4.5 /10.",

Even with the aftereffects and hypocrisy being shown by both sides, the root of fundamental belief makes a difference, which, as fit for an American movie, this avoids addressing.

            "review": "This time around, he has chosen a different genre to terrify us with, a contemporary western. Eddington is an unsuspecting thrill ride with plenty of laughs, classic western callbacks, fresh new characters, and gut punching scenes.The action is ramped up compared to Aster's previous films. It's a step out to show the violent, defensive side of America bubbling up through our cast of characters. In typical Aster fashion, though, the brute force is reserved for about the second half of the movie exclusively. It's very hard to call this an action movie in that case, but Aster's films are impossible to define by their genre any way.The laughs and comedic moments are better than ever in Eddington. All the visual gags and reoccurring jokes aid the uncanny feeling of reality. Many real Americans talk and act the way characters do in Eddington. The most effective way to cope is to observe and laugh. It never feels like Aster is trying to push a political agenda with the comedy in Eddington. It comes from a place of trying to highlight the ridiculous absurdity that is America in 2020.The western callbacks and references are backed in the films DNA. None of the western moments feel like after thoughts. The stand offs, walking in places the character shouldn't, and bad guys rolling in on the horizon all feel whole-heartedly Eddington. These western callbacks aren't just tacked on to call it a western. The references are deliberately placed and feel well planned to suit the story.Overall, I will be seeing Eddington in theaters again. The theater I saw it in on Thursday, opening night, had maybe 10 people in it. Everybody laughed, squirmed, and moaned, but it wasn't enough for a single viewing. I'm willing to bet I'll pick up on even more details next time around. Side note: There are many small, written, sometimes hidden details in many frames. You should watch it in a theater.",

Howard explained that he had the project in mind for a time, worked on it some during the recent COVID pandemic and lockdowns. He knew it would not be a project that a typical studio would go for so he went at it his way.The movie is a fictional drama based on real people and their attempt to find their own Eden in the Galápagos Islands (filmed in Australia). It doesn't work out as hoped because, in the end, people are people and they can cooperate together for only so long.This is analogous to the theme that played out in the year 2000 movie, \"The Beach\" with Leo Dicaprio. As I wrote in my comments for that one, \"Even though these 20 or 30 men and women all went to the island for \"pleasure seeking\", ultimately roles need to be taken, duties accepted, not everyone agrees, jealousy starts to erode relationships, certain people seek power, and when some get seriously injured, \"out of sight, out of mind\" is the remedy so as not to upset \"paradise.\" In other words, they end up creating on a smaller scale the same world that they sought to escape from. Eventually this \"house of cards\" starts to fall down, and ultimately everyone realizes paradise is internal, not some idyllic place.\"Good for Howard to bring this story to the screen.",

At one of the remotest areas on earth there is a clash of personalities; philosophical, libertine, and practical. While one couple seeks solitude, another wants to build a luxury hotel, and the third desires a nourishing place for family. As bugs and boars bite hard, and food and water become as scarce as doctors, police, and dentists, each couple is in for a shock. Darwin would be pleased, for on the island that gave him his fame it is survival of fittest all over again.In this true story it is intriguing to see the starkly different personalities battle it out like in a miniature world. Ron Howard who was present at this screening at the Toronto International Film Festival, was captivated by the zany stories of the characters, and the good and bad of each of them. If anything, he said, he had to dial the antics back. It is hard to choose a side. Jude Law and the other actors are capable and convincing. Hans Zimmer orchestrated the playlist. How many soundtracks can one person do? I wish there was a little more depth to the dialogue, but Eden is a pleasure to watch and contemplate.",

It was a sluggishly paced narrative, and it was just generally not interesting. As for it being a thriller? Well, don't get your hopes up. The narrative in the movie was so disinteresting that I couldn't finish the movie. I tossed the towel in the ring 40 minutes into the 130 minute runtime. It was just painfully and brutally dull and boring.Aside from Jude Law, the only performers on the cast list that I was familiar with was Richard Roxburgh, Sydney Sweeney and Ana de Armas.

The cinematography is outstanding, complete with some stunning views of some gorgeous landscapes that are pretty obviously not the Galapagos. The dialogue is also usually good.What fails miserably is every other aspect of the writing. The characters are all either over-the-top cliches or one-dimensional drones, none of which have any depth whatsoever. Most of them are written to be unlikable, and the writers are a little too successful in that regard. (The only slightly sympathetic character is the insufferable nihilist, who just wants to be left alone when a bunch of twats show up at his door) There's really no good reason for these people to go to an island just to get at each others throats, and the writers REALLY stretch to justify that progression. A lot of people doing irrationally bad things to each other for no particular reason, just to contrive tension. There is more than one point where the movie starts feeling (weirdly) like an episode of Survivor. You'll catch what I mean if you're reading this before watching.I have a feeling the writers have never actually set foot in nature, but have taken everything they know from other movies. There's a lot about the island, animals, and plants that just doesn't make sense. From what I've read about the real-life events, I think the writers tried to include key points but didn't understand them enough to do so realistically. I'm pretty sure one of the characters was planting manure at one point. Not fertilizing with manure, digging a hole and putting a chunk of manure in it. Is that how people in Hollywood think farming is done? They don't seem to know how dogs (wild or otherwise) behave either, which is kind of baffling. There's a scene in which the dogs could have shot laser beams from their eyes, and it wouldn't have been much more absurd than what was actually on the screen.This is supposed to be based on the true story but as with a lot of movies the key points are there, but the details are completely made up. And in this case, poorly. It's pretty bad when so little is known of the real story, and it still feels more realized than the dramatized version.",

It's all so dark, dour and boring.In summation, this widely missed opportunity has to rate as one of Ron Howards weakest efforts - the only saving grace is De Armas, who wonderfully hams it up in her pivotal antagonistic role.

In terms of feeling, 'Eden' was not represented in the media at all, apparently these days there is a lack of the muse to be caught up in realistic darkness and human abysses. The only partially resolved 'Galapagos Affair' sheds light on the hopes and utopias of conquering a new land or escaping the old world in order to build an alternative civilisation there, and how human nature buries all dreams again. The supposed heaven turns into a hell of envy, jealousy, selfishness and vanity. Not forgetting the harsh reality of the supposed island paradise. All the supposed and proven events are almost unbelievable, which makes this survival trip all the more fascinating. A real true-crime story.

There is a narration throughout the movie, yet right from 'Act Three,' everything seen and experienced unfolds perfectly in 'Act One.' Ejiofor & Gillan are fantastic in Act Three but if The Life of Chuck is to be nominated for anything, it has to be the sound. From the cosmic elements in 'Act Three' to the dancing scenes in 'Acts Two & One,' Flanagan did an exceptional job incorporating the sound throughout.Of course, everyone was focusing on Hiddleston and his character, but Tom even mentioned\nit was really a team effort in Act Two and Annalise Basso, Hiddleston's dance partner in Act Two, and Taylor Gordon (who is in the credits as The Pocket Queen), the busker, all three combined with their choreographers Mandy Moore & Stephanie Powell really make the dance scene sing. Taylor Gordon is a talent in herself in her brief, but excellent role.What surprised me was how Act One was with young Chuck and no one talks about how excellent the kids were. Their performances were just as brilliant as the adults, if not more so when young Chuck receives a very haunting monologue from his grandfather (an unbelievable Mark Hamill) about certain choices in life. Act One really helps put the puzzle together that was Act Three, where the cosmic elements can be off-putting, but it all serves a purpose. Stephen King is right when he says The Life of Chuck is one of the good ones. The spirit and energy is felt from beginning to end, and with all on board performances giving their best, Flanagan is further establishing himself as one of contemporary's greater directors.One thing I will say is The Life of Chuck is dedicated In Memory to Scott Wampler. And there are a few cameos in The Life of Chuck but Scott's inclusion just tugged me right at the heart. Great film.",

Directed by Mike Flanagan and adapted from Stephen King's novella, this film is a deeply moving exploration of life's fleeting moments and the quiet, powerful ways one person can leave a mark on the world.Tom Hiddleston gives a captivating performance as Charles \"Chuck\" Krantz, portraying his life in reverse, from death back to childhood. Jacob Tremblay and Benjamin Pajak, who portray Chuck at younger ages, deliver equally sincere and affecting performances, each capturing the spirit and complexity of the character at various stages of his life. The film's unconventional structure may initially challenge viewers, but by the end, it offers a resonant, emotionally rich experience that lingers long after the credits roll.The supporting cast brings warmth, depth, and surprise. Mia Sara, in a heartfelt return to the screen, shines as Chuck's mother. Matthew Lillard's brief appearance is both deeply touching and meomorable (my one complaint is that he did not return later in the movie), and Mark Hamill lends weight and tenderness in his role as Chuck's grandfather. Nick Offerman serves as the narrator, and his voice, calm, grounded, and thoughtful, beautifully anchors the film's reflective tone.As a teacher, I was especially moved by the portrayal of educators. Characters like Miss Richards (Kate Siegel), Miss Rohrbacher (Samantha Sloyan), and the beautifully portrayed role by Chiwetel Ejiofor, all embody the kind of teachers we aspire to be, compassionate, inspiring, and transformative. Their presence in Chuck's life is a testament to the quiet heroism of educators.And I have to say it, Rahul Kohli is a joy to watch in everything he does. His presence is always a highlight.The Life of Chuck is more than just a film, it's a love letter to life, memory, connection, and the meaning we create in our short time here. Flanagan's masterful direction, paired with a stellar cast and emotionally intelligent storytelling, makes this one of the most beautiful and thought-provoking films of the year.I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone ready to be moved, and reminded of what truly matters.",

The rest of the cast is worth more than an honorable mention alone, as many familiar faces grace the screen (especially toward the beginning of the film). Lastly, I tend to love this 'type' of movie. I can't give too much away without using a spoiler tag, but if you watch the interview(s) with the cast featured here on IMDB, you'll know what \"type\" I am referring to. I wonder if I can get away with 'apocalyptic', since that is a word straight from one of these interviews.That said ... it was a bit of a letdown for me.The beginning was slow, but it was good. It built an expectancy toward so much more and a feeling that it was going to get so much better. Sadly, that was never fully realized or delivered.Beginning in the second act, the film definitely starts to bog down and suffers from side or follow-up scenes that are just way too long and a bit far-fetched. The narration, too, is used far too often to the point of it just about verging on annoying.By the third act, when they begin to introduce what is supposed to be the point of the entire thing, it has already been too bogged down by too much of not enough - if that makes sense. While the child actor is adorable and does so well, here too the movie just drags.Moreover, everything is so overly-EXPLAINED. It's kind of like Flanagan did not trust the audience to understand what was happening, so either the narrator or characters went to great lengths to explain every detail. Well, while some may disagree, I believe audiences are more intelligent than this film gives them (us) credit for.Sorry Mike Flanagan fans, but this is the third time I have been let down by one of his offerings. :(",

There's so many small details from clocks, to people in the background. There are some mystical elements about it, but at the end of the day it's pretty simple, Chucks life wasn't extreme or grand, but the universe he goes on to create, the one that lives inside of him is immense, and powerful. The message of how astounding one life can be, just go out and live, because your time will eventually come, and you'll have wished you followed your true passions. 10/10, I definitely recommend. Especially to real film watchers.",

It was two weeks after its \"wide\" release before it finally showed up to our local art house/second run movie theater. The chain multiplexes gave it a complete miss.Mike Flanagan is a very talented screenwriter and director and this was possibly Stephen King's most sentimental work. And there's two INCREDIBLE dance scenes. The result is completely human, uplifting film.There is some anxiety inducing story in the start of the film, but it is not a horror film by any measure. King is also very good with general fiction too, after all.This movie will stick with you for awhile. Hours after my viewing, I was still thinking about it (and tearing up.)",

            "review": "I feel like this movie had all the parts to make it a beautiful experience, but it failed to put them together properly. The initial mystery in act 1 is quite intriguing and makes you wonder, what this kind-looking man Chuck, that keeps popping up in advertisements all over the world has to do with the planets looming demise. But acts 2 and 3 (or 2 and 1, as the movie decides to engage in \"reverse\" storytelling) fail to convey a coherent story or motive. It is all losely held together by the premise of \"being your true self\" and \"you are all the things that you experience and all the memories that you make\" but the way these themes are shown are on the one hand to vague to truly get you invested, but on the other hand also riddled in clichees. The grandpa giving a discouraging speech to the kid about how it is more important to stick to tangible things like math, than to creative aspirations. The teacher giving a 5 minute talk to his ex-wife about \"how we are only a blip second in the eternity that is the universe\". The kid finally overcoming his fears of expressing himself at the most clichee high-school graduation dance scene of all time. It has the topics that are supposed to make you cry and feel hopeful at the same time, but they feel like you have seen them before a million times in better stories. And the most intriguing part of the plot, the most profound experience that the main character must have had had throughout his entire life is only revealed to us in the final scene. It would have been great to see, how this would have shaped his actions going forward, but in the timeline of the movie, we only get one scene of him afterwards. And while it includes an impressive dance choreography, it is not enough to fully capture the character´s whole underlying motivation. And the overall explanation of the initial mystery also kind of falls flat.I left the cinema feeling nothing.",

I had also watched the trailer beforehand, which offered little insight, so I went in blind, hoping for a powerful story or a meaningful message.From the start, I assumed the film would offer some sort of profound life lesson. If there was one, I'm still not sure what it was supposed to be. Perhaps the idea was that once you know your future, especially your death, you live differently or maybe you just wait for the inevitable. Either way, the message was muddled and unconvincing.The movie frequently broke from its own sense of reality, pulling me into moments that felt more surreal than purposeful. This made it hard to stay emotionally invested or grounded in the story. While the ending was certainly unexpected, it left me feeling empty rather than reflective.What disappointed me most was how slowly the film unfolded, dragging the audience along with very little payoff. By the time the final scene arrived, it felt flat and unsatisfying. I expected much more from a movie with such high praise.In short, this film didn't live up to the hype-and for me, it was a letdown.",

            "review": "It's incredibly frustrating to watch a film that has so much potential but ultimately fails to capitalize on it. Such is the case with one of the most heavily anticipated offerings of the summer movie season, \"The Life of Chuck, from writer-director Mike Flanagan, based on the short story of the same name from author Steven King. Told in three acts in reverse chronological order, the picture follows the life of Charles \"Chuck\" Krantz (Tom Hiddleston) and how his adult self emerged from a childhood of mixed experiences under the care of his paternal grandparents (Mark Hamill, Mia Sara). It focuses on how an inquisitive preteen (Jacob Tremblay) with a love of and gift for dance ultimately (and largely inexplicably) settled for a mediocre life as an accountant instead, one whose existence was sadly cut short in his prime and subsequently provided the basis for soul-searching and introspective reflection among characters and audience members alike. In telling this story, the film seeks to address a variety of grand philosophical and cosmological questions, many of which are tied to regrets about the compromises we make during our lifetimes. While the film certainly has its share of genuine flashes of brilliance in this regard, there aren't nearly enough of them, and those that manage to surface are frequently underdeveloped, soft peddled, applied inconsistently (even in contradictory fashion) or significantly watered down. It's almost as if the filmmaker lacked sufficient confidence in his own message, yielding a superficial, uneven, sometimes treacly treatment of its foundational principles. The fault here primarily lies with a script that should have gone through one or more additional rounds of revisions to refine what it was attempting to achieve - its quest to make the truly profound statement it was striving for instead of settling for something far less sublime and eminently unsatisfying. Moreover, the screenplay's shortcomings carry over into other aspects of the production, particularly the unnecessary inclusion of extraneous material while simultaneously undercooking other more relevant elements. And this, in turn, affects such other aspects as the film's underwhelming editing and sometimes-unimpressive performances (most notably Hiddleston, who ends up primarily playing a glorified walk-on). To its credit, there are some noteworthy attributes, such as the positively mesmerizing opening sequence (as presented here, \"Act Three\"), the picture's delightful sense of whimsy, clever (if occasionally overdone) homages to other pictures (especially \"Back to the Future\" (1985) and \"The Truman Show\" (1998)), an excellent original score and commendable complementary soundtrack (despite its mind-boggling exclusion of what would have been a perfectly suited addition, one that Tom Petty fans will readily recognize), and a fine supporting performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor. But, these assets aside, they're not enough to make up for the picture's shortfalls. To that end, then, moviegoers looking for better screening choices that address material like what was intended here would be wise to view Tim Burton's far superior \"Big Fish\" (2003) instead. Indeed, had it been handled more adeptly, \"The Life of Chuck\" could have been one of the best-ever adaptations of one of King's works and one of the best overall releases of recent years, a picture with much to offer audiences on so many fronts. Unfortunately, we'll never get to see that film and the valuable wisdom it could have imparted for how we live our lives and how we can get the most out of them while we have the chance.",

You have a great ensemble cast that includes Tom Hiddleston, Jacob Tremblay, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Karen Gillan, Mark Hamill, Annalise Basso, Mia Sara, Matthew Lillard, Carl Lumbly, Samantha Sloyan, Harvey Guillen, Kate Siegel, Nick Offerman, Q'orianka Kilcher, David Dastmalchian, Rahul Kohli, Heather Langenkamp, Michael Trucco, Molly C.

It also helps that every character in this movie is likable and even the ones who have flaws that are still likable people. The movie has a fantastic pace to the story that had me engaged and I wanted to know what was going to happen in the different timelines of Chuck Krantz's life. The movie is basically everyone having a conversation with other people and while that could be boring, Mike Flanagan does an excellent job at making them engaging for the audience. There are moments in the movie that had me smiling and I was on the verge of tears. And finally, the movie has a fantastic job at delivering its messages in a way that feel sincere to its audience.Overall, The Life of Chucky (2025) was a wonderful experience from start to finish and it is one of my favorite movies of 2025.",

            "review": "When you think of the pairing of Stephen King and filmmaker Mike Flanagan, your immediate thought is likely horror. The American author is famous for novels like It, The Shining, and Misery, while the American filmmaker has delivered some of the most acclaimed horror in the last decade with Oculus (2013), The Haunting of Hill House (2018), and Doctor Sleep (2019). Yet their latest collaboration ventures far from the horror genre, instead embracing a more philosophical and contemplative tone.The Life of Chuck (2024) is adapted from a short story in King's collection If It Bleeds. Told in three acts and in reverse chronological order, the story begins at the end: we follow a high school teacher (Chiwetel Ejiofor) in a dystopian near-future that feels uncomfortably present-rolling blackouts, raging wildfires, and mounting conflict between Pakistan and India. When the face of a seeming nobody, Charles Krantz (Tom Hiddleston), begins appearing on billboards and ads with a cryptic message-\"Thank you, Chuck, for 39 great years\"-no one can explain why, especially amid an apparent apocalypse. We then move backward in time to meet Chuck as an adult: an unassuming accountant. Eventually, we arrive at his childhood, where he is raised by his math-loving, alcoholic grandfather (Mark Hamill) and his dance-loving grandmother (Mia Sara).The Life of Chuck is difficult to summarize-or even introduce. That ambiguity likely contributed to its initial struggle to secure distribution, despite winning the top prize at the prestigious Toronto International Film Festival. The film begins as a gripping dystopian drama but gradually transforms into a slice-of-life meditation on an ordinary man's existence. It ultimately feels more akin to a Noah Baumbach or Richard Linklater film than to the usual work of Flanagan or King, evoking the emotional resonance of King's Stand by Me and The Green Mile.This isn't a cradle-to-grave biopic but rather a presentation of three key moments in Chuck's life, tied together by Nick Offerman's warm narration that channels King's lyrical prose. Both King and Flanagan have a gift for crafting vivid characters in mere seconds, perhaps best illustrated in a mall dance sequence where three people we've only just met share a moment so emotionally resonant that it nearly brings you to tears. Yet the emotional core of the film lies in Chuck's youth, which gives us the fullest picture of his life and connects the dots established in the earlier acts. In many ways, the film mirrors how we get to know people in real life: starting with a surface impression, discovering small clues to their passions, and then uncovering the deeper history that shaped them. This reverse narrative structure is rare in cinema, used most famously by Christopher Nolan in Memento (2000) to depict the experience of short-term memory loss.The Life of Chuck is a mosaic of small moments, interactions, and observations that cumulatively reveal the life of a man who may, at first glance, seem insignificant. But King's story and Flanagan's adaptation elevate the ordinary, framing the narrative with Walt Whitman's poem Song of Myself, especially the line: \"I contain multitudes.\" This quote becomes key to understanding the supernatural undercurrents and thematic glue that binds the film's three acts.Some viewers may wish for more obvious connections between the segments or a more traditional narrative arc. Each act is a gem in its own right, but the transitions can feel abrupt or disconnected. Still, adding filler or more conventional storytelling would only dilute the film's essence. The sparse structure is deliberate-and powerful. Padding it with exposition or additional characters would risk undermining the film's emotional clarity and philosophical weight. Flanagan's refusal to spoon-feed the audience is a courageous choice and one of the reasons I admire him as a filmmaker, both on television and in cinema. Like Terrence Malick's later work-though far less pretentious-The Life of Chuck asks the viewer to meet it halfway.Visually, Flanagan continues to impress with a clean, distinctive cinematic language that enhances rather than distracts. His editing and pacing feel like listening to a master orator-confident, fluid, and perfectly timed. He's also one of the most consistent directors of actors working today, drawing superb performances from both stars and newcomers alike. While Hiddleston and Ejiofor are predictably excellent, it's the younger cast-especially Benjamin Pajak as young Chuck-who shine. Even those with only a line or two make an impression, thanks in part to strong casting and Flanagan's knack for coaxing depth from every performance.In the end, The Life of Chuck is as difficult to classify as it is to explain. Its vignettes and meditations on what makes a life meaningful steer clear of sentimentality to deliver a heartfelt and enriching experience. With bold direction, a unique structure if slightly disjointed, and a profound source text, The Life of Chuck may not follow the rules-but that's precisely why it shouldn't be missed.",

Yes, there is a central idea that is IMHO transplanted from Hindu mythology in utterly masterful manner - but it is turned on its head and used as the means of telling a profoundly human story about the profoundly human and universal fact: life is greater than the sum of its moments but even just one perfect moment could be worth living through an entire tumultuous existence filled with good and bad, mishaps and tragedies, traumas and heartbreaks.It is astounding to have a film like this made in this manner in 2025. Almost as if the Universe was asking for it :)...The cast and acting is superb, the directing is as one would expect from Flanagan, and adaptation of the story is flawless...Maybe young people will not resonate with some of its most heartbreaking (and at the same time uplifting) concepts & moments - but even then if someone just sees this as \"sentimental\" then, with all due respect, is totally missing the point.It has even more tremendous impact if one hasn't read the story nor the various detailed reviews.We, humans, wherever we are on the map... we needed this movie.",

Life of Chuck falls into the latter category. In addition to being well written and acted, the telling of the story in reverse is generally difficult, and in this outing is surprisingly effective. And it's fun finding the Easter Eggs in the third part of the movie that explains much of the action in the first part.I really liked this, though I fear it will be divisive. Nonlinear (or counter linear?) storytelling is not everyone's cup of tea. My husband hated it until I told him it's a Mike Flanagan movie (we're fans) and it then made sense.

And the way the trailer showed us the bad girls, seems extremely forced in there. But I'm pleased to say, that the trailers kind of miss marketed the movie. First off, it's more bad guys. If you like, what the first movie did. If you like these characters. The sequel delivers exactly what that first movie delivered on. The heist, the great character moments, the spy elements. Everything that makes that first movie as good as it is, is all in the sequel. And like I mentioned before, I was worried about the bad guys now being good, I thought making a sequel with them good, would make it feel like a forced sequel. But that is not the case at all, the movie goes down a certain direction that makes the plot work. But I'm glad that we got a sequel now making them good people, because this movie would not have been the same thing without that plot line in there. That I am now excited and want more sequels based on these characters. I want to see a whole franchise built with them! This needs to be DreamWorks next big franchise they have because they can now do so many storylines with them. And since there's books on them, I expect that we will be getting that. Now, let's talk about the bad girls. The main part of this movie. And I gotta say, I love what they did with them. Throughout the entire movie I was just thinking about how great of villains they are, I haven't broke this fully down so I don't know 100% on how I would feel about it, but there's a chance that these villains are a top 10 DreamWorks villain. Take everything great about the bad guys but this time as a villain switching that perspective up. That's why they're such great villains. And I gotta say, I think this movie is better than the original. It's not by much, if you check my ranking is only a spot higher. It really only depends on my mood, but right now I'm feeling the second one is better. I think the villains are 10 times stronger, I think a lot of the character moments and stakes are 10 times stronger, and it's still captures all the magic from the original film. This is a great sequel to the original film. But it's not without its problems. For starters, yes, this movie is fun, it still gives us everything great about the original film. But when leaving the theater, all I thought was, yeah that was fun/cool. And sitting down writing this review, it just seems like a distant memory that happened. It didn't seem like I watched the movie today. So it's a movie you can watch. Enjoy your time with it and continue on with your day. Not really something that sticks in your mind for a long time. And although I do love the villain, I do question the plan in the long run. Although all the set up is great, I was very confused on what the villain wanted to do once they won. But, this is a great sequel to the original film that carries out everything you love about the original film, and in my opinion is slightly better than it. It's as funny, but with higher stakes, better villains, and I can't wait to see what future installments have to bring.",

It dives deeper into the emotional lives of the characters while delivering fast-paced thrills and clever twists. The balance between action, comedy, and character development is perfectly tuned.The returning cast of lovable antiheroes is even more endearing this time around. Mr. Wolf continues to charm with his charisma and conflict, and his connection with Diane gives the film an emotional weight that feels genuine and powerful. Their bond is the soul of the movie.New characters like the Bad Girls add a whole new layer of energy and intrigue. They're complex, fun, and absolutely electric on screen. You can't help but enjoy every moment they're involved.Visually, the film is a masterpiece. The animation style remains slick and vibrant, and the action sequences are exhilarating without ever being overwhelming. The musical score is punchy and dynamic, elevating each scene to cinematic brilliance.At its core, The Bad Guys 2 is about redemption, trust, and what it means to choose who you want to be - and it delivers those themes with sincerity and heart.This sequel is everything fans hoped for and more - clever, bold, and bursting with personality.

And just like Despicable Me, once the \"bad guys\" stop being bad, the title-and the whole concept-starts to fall apart. The screenplay here is stuck from the very beginning, trying to make the good guys bad without actually making them bad, because they're supposed to be good-but were kind of already good to begin with. Confused? Yep, exactly. Now imagine trying to write that.The first Bad Guys didn't exactly blow anyone away, but it got by on novelty. The only real way to make a sequel work is if the characters were memorable or endearing enough to survive beyond the original's gimmick. Think Toy Story, which pulled it off four times, or Shrek, who still manages to get kids lining up for photos despite some truly rough sequels. Unfortunately, the Bad Guys just don't have that same unique appeal. It's not that they're unlikeable-they just don't stand out enough to make you care once the novelty wears off.That brings us to Bad Guys 2 itself. Does it work as a film? Unsurprisingly, it struggles under the weight of its conceptual flaws. You can't really root for the \"bad guys\" in a story where their problems are self-inflicted and their moral arc is basically a loop. The film is so busy trying to twist the narrative-making the good guys bad again so they can become good again-that it becomes exhausting to follow. It's overloaded (ironically) with MacGuffins and diversions, and by the end, nothing feels satisfying or earned.What's frustrating is that a more daring concept could've saved this. Imagine a version where society refuses to accept the bad guys' reform, pushing them back into villainy. That could've asked deeper questions about redemption and the system's role in change. It would've been a tighter, more meaningful story. But that idea is dropped almost immediately, leaving us with a safe, forgettable mishmash of spy clichés and heist movie leftovers.Visually, the animation suffers from the same identity crisis. During the fast-paced, Looney Tunes-style action sequences, the film comes alive-but everything in between feels flat. The half-3D, half-2D aesthetic never commits to either direction, so it ends up feeling more like a compromise than a bold creative choice.In truth, Bad Guys 2 isn't unwatchable. But nothing here is going to set your world on fire either. The franchise might still have potential-but only if it embraces what makes it fun: letting the bad guys actually be bad. Push the animation style further, ditch the redemption loop, and lean into the chaos. That's the movie people might actually want to see.",

Which ison me because I should have looked it up first, I naturally just assumed it would be similar to the first one.",

It's a solid animated film, and the characters are really likable (Mr. Wolf and Mr. Shark in particular for me).However, after the ending of the first Bad Guys movie, which turned the Bad Guys into Good Guys, I think the story and setting lost some of its charm. It would have been nice to explore that in more depth, but it also feels impossible to reverse. I quite liked the ending and would definitely watch a third installment.",

            "review": "'The Bad Guys 2 (2025)' is, first and foremost, a ton of fun. It's energetic, it's enjoyable, it's exactly what you expect it to be but no worse for it. This propulsive, well-paced sequel is brought to life with expressive, high-octane animation that consistently drops your jaw with its gorgeous storybook-meets-Saturday-morning-cartoon aesthetic. Some of it is undeniably inspired by anime, with exaggerated 2D shock reactions and unmistakable sound effects, and it feels really distinct amongst its peers who strive for cartoon realism. It's stylish, it's slick, its visuals totally compliment its tone and atmosphere. It's a joy to look at from its first frame to its last, and it absolutely sprints through its generic but entertaining narrative without feeling rushed or missing a single step. It's a total blast that sweeps you off your feet, packed full of exciting set-pieces, humourous interactions, and satisfying in-the-moment subversions that often lead to some effortlessly - and genuinely - cool moments (not a lot of movies can pull off being cool without seeming like they're trying too hard to do so) that recall silky smooth heist films like 'Ocean's Eleven (2001)' and often scratch the itch left by the cancellation of the 'Sly Cooper' feature. It's arguably not quite as good as its predecessor, but it isn't far off. It's certainly a worthy sequel and it's one of Dreamworks' better animated efforts (it isn't in the top ten, I'd say, but it's pretty close). It isn't deep, but it is entertaining and that's all you really need it to be. Besides, its story is still really solid. Its characters are well-rounded (even if their arcs aren't as big this time around), its relationships are believable, its messages are (very) subtle but important, and its plot is incredibly efficient. There are some superb action scenes sprinkled throughout, and the cast all do a brilliant job at bringing their characters to life (Sam Rockwell is a phenomenal lead, his acting acumen clearly coming across even when he's playing an animated wolf). It's all just really fun, and it looks as good as it feels. This is a really strong follow-up to one of Dreamworks' most successful new efforts. I'd definitely welcome a third entry.",

(mind you I'm a huge sucker for that.)Throughtout the film I was captavated through the twist and turns the movie had during its runtime. It would have you believe what you think and once you know that's going to happen they pull the rug right from under you. Even though it is a Dreamworks kid movie they have some subtle adult joke to keep us entertained only if you are paying attenetion that is. Also I wanna give huge credit to the animators because you can tell they had fun with this. Best animated summer film for 2025!",

            "review": "The Bad Guys 2 is a highly entertaining sequel that successfully builds on the fun and charm of the first film. It brings back the same group of lovable misfit characters, each with their own unique personality, and adds some fresh twists to keep the story engaging. The movie is full of fast-paced action, clever humor, and heartwarming moments that remind us why we loved these characters in the first place.One of the film's strongest points is its animation style-vibrant, stylish, and full of energy. The visuals feel like a mix of comic book flair and classic heist-movie cool, which makes it stand out from other animated films. The pacing is snappy, the action scenes are creative without being overwhelming, and the soundtrack adds a lot of flair.What really makes the movie work, though, is the chemistry between the characters. Their teamwork, banter, and development feel genuine and fun to watch. There's also a nice balance between comedy and deeper themes like trust, redemption, and finding your place in the world. These moments give the film emotional depth without slowing it down.It's not a perfect film-it doesn't take many risks, and some parts feel a bit familiar if you've seen the first one. But for a sequel, it holds up impressively well and keeps the spirit of the original alive while offering enough new content to feel fresh.Overall, The Bad Guys 2 is a fun, smart, and well-animated adventure that works for all ages. I'd give it a strong 8 out of 10. It may not break new ground, but it delivers exactly what it promises-and does it with style and heart.",

As some point they end up on a rocket going into space because ... reasons. The rocket is owned by a company called MoonX. Yes, MoonX.

However, I like Dreamworks Animation and I want to see what they offer even if they don't make great stuff at times. With this new sequel, despite some new territories the movie explores, the same criticisms I have from the previous movie are still rampant.The animation and character designs are pretty good, as the colors, models and the presentation does offer a silly and non-serious 90s action vibe within the environment. Alongside with the uses of the background and sound designs whenever action or thrills is presented. The voice performances from the cast members are also pretty good. I did appreciate some of the non-serious aspects as it clearly understands how crazy the scenarios are.The writing, as the previous, the story never really felt grand, as it felt predictable and many of the choices felt as if it took other movies ideas and placed them together. With the humor being quite unfunny (especially the fart jokes, fart jokes usually takes the experience away), the characters weren't really interesting. The character of Mr. Wolf has some high moments but many of the other characters were either uninteresting or simply quite annoying. Particularly the characters of Mr. Snake and Shark, I really didn't believe a single word from them as they comedic banter and personality really didn't work for me.Alongside with some awkward dialogue and bad musical choices, the way the writing and atmosphere is approached is definitely trying it's best to capture the essence of a Lethal Weapon and 90s or 80s comedy action vibe, however the tone at times feels a bit forced as feels as if nostalgia bait is apparent.In conclusion, lovers for the first one will appreciate this sequel, but as a whole, the experience for me as been boring and unimpressive. Dreamworks Animation, despite one good banger recently, has been overall disappointing, disappointing, and disappointing.",

The adventure with the former bandits turning a new leaf, but this time they find themselves struggling to fit in as good guys and gain the trust of the community. When suspicious robberies begin to occur, they get coerced and reunite once again to pull off an immense heist, but this time with a band of female thieves.The Bad Guys 2 recurs the all-star voice cast, plus some new strong female voices. These delinquent characters take you into the middle of the fray and use clever tactics to get out of any sticky situation - Mr. Wolf comes up with creative plans and is always two steps ahead. These bad guys will keep you laughing with Marmalade portraying his best impression of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the witty exchanges from Ms. Tarantula and panicky Mr. Shark, even the flatulent gags from Mr. Piranha that never seem to get old. He certainly has tuna power!No matter the tragedy these fearless critters encounter, they do not lose sight of their friendship and the meaning of hope. Although they have tarnished pasts, their talent and skills do not get overlooked by Chief Luggins. Perhaps a secret operative could be the next sequel? It would not be a \"bad\" idea.**Review also posted on Countdown City Geeks webpage***",

Now to be fair, I was a little worried if the filmmakers were going to be able to make a good sequel to that movie because Disney has had a rough couple of years, but I'm happy to say that this movie was good.Positives for Freakier Friday (2025):\nLindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis kill it in this movie and they recapture the magic and charm of their performances from the 2003 movie while also being in different places in life. It feels like they never left these roles and they set down into these characters like the 2003 movie came out last year. I did like some of the new characters particularly Julia Butters and Sophia Hammons as the two stepdaughters of Lindsay Lohan's character. You do get some nice callbacks of the 2003 movies and they didn't feel like cheap fan service. The plot of the movie is different enough from the original to help it stand out instead of feeling like a cheap copy of what happened 22 years ago with the characters. And finally, the insanity of the premise is still intact with everything that happens in this movie and that make me very happy.Mixed for Freakier Friday (2025):\nThere is still a nature to the story not making any logical sense as to what is going on, but I don't care because I was having fun with it.Negatives for Freakier Friday (2025):\nThe movie does feel it is overstuffed with subplots and characters who feel like they shouldn't even be here and they did drag the movie a a lot for me. Honestly, I did forget some of the subplots as they felt so random and pointless that if you took them out of the story, you would still have the same movie. And finally, there is one scene that literally exists for product placement and it was so hilariously dumb that this scene actually made it into the final product.Overall, Freakier Friday (2025) is a good continuation of the 2003 movie and it was fun to see these characters getting back to the insanity of the story from 22 years ago and I am happy to say that.",

I was worried at first because this was supposed to be a straight to Disney+ movie. So I did not know what to expect. But I'm pleased to say this legacy sequel keeps everything great about that movie while still having its own heart felt moments to it. Lindsay Lohan, and Jamie Lee Curtis are back! And are as great as ever. Even after all these years they are still able to make these characters work. They are both two different characters, and they both absolutely sell it on both of them and make you believe that they are actually two different characters. It's just the right comedic timing and acting. It's so believable. And even the new cast of kids they have in here, same thing goes for them. They do actually feel like the older cast of characters. And thats whats so fun about playing a role like this, you're able to change your personality up and be over the top and make it work. It's crazy that even 20 years later, not only the actors, but the script, the story, all still works and feels like it's only been a few years after the original film. The comedy is still as funny as always, the story is still that classic freaky Friday story, but with more heart. Yes, we still keep that classic formula. But this time since there's four characters being swapped around, and kids trying to change up their parents marriage. It adds for this whole new layer of satisfaction near the end. The character arcs had a meaning and they went through something because you cared for the characters. It had more meaning because of that extra layer you decided to put on. It is not just a mother daughter banter, this time it's the whole family banter and that's why it works better. Now, this is not better than the original film. No one was expecting it to be. But it is still very much on the same par as the original film because it still keeps everything great about the original film, just 20 years later. But of course, the movie is still predictable, we've seen this formula before you seen this type of movie before you know how it's gonna end. But the journey to get there and that heartfelt ending is what makes it worth watching. If you have nostalgia for that original film or just love the freaky Friday movies this is your thing, but if you did not grow up on that, don't know what this is. Don't check this out.

There scenes were my favourite in the movie. The other girls, Julia Butters who plays Lohan's daughter (and later Lohan) and Sophia Hammond who plays Lohan's soon to be daughter in law (and later Jamie Lee Curtis) are both great, too. Manny Jacinto is perfect as Lohan's husband to be, Mark Harmon is back, but isn't given much to do and I don't think he even shared a scene with Lohan.The ending is quite emotional, it does have a lot of heart to it. Especially if you have kids or have lost a parent.This feels like this was filmed as a streaming movie, that the decided to go theatrical, with. It just feels small scale. It is a bit convoluted and the swapping around is more than a bit confusing at first. A few times, I had to take a minute and think who I was watching!!

Instead, it just seems to hash over the same story beats as the first film, but this time with an additional body swap scenario that added nothing of real value and just made the whole thing feel a bit messy.In fact, this is my main gripe with the film. Having Jamie Lee Curtis' Tess swap bodies with Sophia Hammons' Lily just seems utterly pointless. It was shoehorned in so that Jamie Lee Curtis could be let loose, but it served no real emotional value. It was also very annoying that the two characters didn't act like they were in the other's body! After the swap, they just felt like two completely different characters. At least with Lindsey Lohan and Julia Butters, they actually felt like they were playing the other character.Aside from this major gripe, the plot also just felt a bit repetitive of the first film just with more people. It also was hard to root for the main characters as they are trying to split up a loving relationship, and considering the end was so obvious what was going to happen it makes the journey there a little tiresome at times.Ultimately though I know this film shouldn't be taken so seriously. It's tongue in cheek and it does have lots of good comedy, and the emotional moments are strong when they focus on Lindsey Lohan's Anna and her daughter. The performances are all pretty good, and I think Manny Jacinto as Anna's fiance is a great addition.Despite being a let down compared to the original one, it is still funny enough and is worth a watch for fans of the first film.",

Freakier Friday continues to add that family-friendly element (for ages above like eleven) that holds elements that we always loved in our Disney Channel originals. Fun little bouts of youthful deviousness mixed with family bonding are much of this film, jokes finding their way into that peppy energy I loved in my teens, but with just a touch of modern maturity to help it. It's a charming adventure for the coming-of-age genre, characters finding footholds to still get better despite the past, helping to illustrate that sometimes we need to learn lessons a few times to get it right. Such elements come with the same Disney presentation, that element of fun, awkward antics, getting us toward the lessons in that clumsy style that will be uncomfortable, but in many cases, fun as old and new once again debate over who is superior. Amid the \"old\" is the nostalgia factor that we love to capitalize on and dive back into. The references are plenty, many new twists or nods to the original that are fun, many turned to help advance the story, or put that right joke into the movie. Some of it is a little heavy-handed or stretched, but I had fun seeing it integrated into the story, especially those comedic gold moments that were so clever that my friend and I laughed out loud for several seconds. Finally, the movie still has the Disney finesse of pulling at your heartstrings, fantastically crafted moments that blend all the Hollywood magic into those memorable moments. Add in the music, a soundtrack that is vibing in so many styles that feel representative of the generations to further help Disney's live action movie feel fun, a few tracks having me tap my toes in glee as I bobbed to the beat.Outside of these qualities, Freakier Friday thrives well on the speeches and dialogue, with solid delivery and background music to help enhance the moment, executed to a grand degree by the cast. I enjoyed all four of the performances, the talented women finding some depth to their performances and accomplishing two roles trapped in one body with some impressive acting ability. Sophia Hammons has poise, panache, and a bratty attitude that her accent sells with such finesse. When the swap occurs, she gets the mannerisms of her switched persona well, making not only the fashion look wonderful, but also the deeper moments at times. Butters was very enjoyable, a mashup of so many personalities that it was hard to choose which form I preferred; all have a good place in this film. But the champions are who you most likely want to hear about, and Lohan continues to redeem herself with roles that have tapped back into her roots, but excelled into mature means that are a nice blend of qualities. Lohan's execution of two personalities worked for me, and I love the dynamic range that she brings with this fun performance. It's Curtis who steals a lot of the show for me, the seasoned actress continuing to look good and own the moments, no matter how silly they are. I love the chemistry between them, the fun energy familiar in many ways, with some moments again a perfect mixture of talent and writing.DISLIKES:\nPredictable\nCheesy\nToo Silly\nPacing Issues\nSome Story Elements That Needed More\nSome Aggressive Comedy\nToo Niche\nFeels Not The Same Caliber As The First\nSummary:\nWhere the movie starts to fail for me comes in the modernization elements that most movies have taken in this age of viewing. As expected, this sequel does not escape the predictable formula this franchise takes, the path not exactly identical to the first film, but incredibly similar as they search for the answers to their predicament. Freakier Friday's fun helps to dilute some of the predictability, though it doesn't do much for the very cheesy and overly silly moments Disney writing brings with it in modern times. Jokes are very much in your face, with a lot of rough patches of over-aggressive one-liners, corny callouts, and exaggerated jokes that may cross into insulting territory depending on your sensitivity. Such aggressive comedy feels very influencer in tone, the attempts to cram so much simplistic silliness are a bit exhausting at times, with only some relief coming from those awesome comedic moments.Other elements that suffered for me were the pacing issues, the film having a bit uneven pace as it went from highs to lows so abruptly that the plot felt disconnected compared to the golden age of live-action storytelling. The story elements are there, providing enough of a bridge, but they felt so unequal in quality, with many characters wasted and lacking the involvement the first one did so well. Key obstacles felt truncated, qualities missing those full-impactful moments, not quite there with many characters' fun cameos for a quick blast to the past, but needing something more to be worth the inclusion than just a fun joke. Too many characters? Too much trying to be integrated? Too focused on the new? I'm not sure, but the story just needs some more polishing and advancements to obtain the same caliber as the first, instead of following into this niche that my friend and I feel this movie is targeted at pleasing.The VERDICT:\nFreakier Friday is one of the better modernizations of a sequel I have seen in a while. There is respect for the old story, but also plenty of new things to help it be its own film, which should be pleasing to the audience. It's a fun movie, some of that Disney magic coming out in full force to make a charming and enchanting film for most families. Great performances help bring the characters to the forefront, nailing double performance expectations, selling some comedic gold moments, and helping pump the theater up with energy that I like my Disney films to have. Other elements help the film flourish in the form of fun lines and good music, giving us that 2000s feeling at times that I loved diving back into after all these years. Sadly, the movie's modern influences are a little more prevalent than I would like, primarily in the story and over-aggressive comedy that has been popular since the mid-2010s. They can be funny at times, some of the clever moments helping cut through the thicket of jokes that are in your face and focused on demographic topics, primarily ageist jokes. While the awkward moments can be funny, the movie concentrates on the jokes a bit too much, not handling the story progression as well as the first. Cute as it may be, alongside some key scene moments, the uneven pacing and quality are what sort of cut this film's quality down a few pegs. It's not bad, that's not what I'm saying. I just think that it's a much more niche film than the first, matching a caliber that feels like a high-quality Disney+ Channel original movie rather than a full blockbuster feature. Is it worth a trip to the theater? For the target audience of moms with daughters this age, or a group of moms looking for a nostalgia trip, this is your movie to have fun with. For the rest, wait for the inevitable release on streaming to maximize your time. My scores for Freakier Friday are:\nComedy/Family/Fantasy: 7.0-7.5\nMovie Overall: 6.5.",

            "review": "The film is truly a tale of two halves. The first act was definitely entertaining. The world design looked amazing. Sprawling scenery and some genuinely scary moments involving the infected. This part of the film was by far the closest to the previous instalments. The direction here stands out - with grainy close-ups, fast jump cuts, and jarring transitions reminiscent of the original film, it pulls you right into the chaos.Unfortunately, the momentum doesn't last. As the film transitions into its second half, it shifts gears into a more melodramatic human drama. The focus moves away from the infected threat and toward a lackluster subplot involving a mother and a doctor. The characters at this point make some questionable decisions which really doesn't help the film's validity.The final act unfortunately teetered on lacklustre and borderline comedic, completely changing the tone of the first act.I stand by saying the directing, camera work, editing and cinematography were the highlight. The landscapes and post apocalyptic setting was beautiful to look at. These elements made the film worth watching. There were some plot elements that were interesting enough but were never explored to the full potential.However a weak plot, even weaker characters and a lacklustre ending prevent this instalment from being memorable.",

Let's do a comparison.-28 Weeks gave us a bigger cast with significantly more story and intrigue, especially when it comes to the father leaving his wife to die in the opening scene and how that comes into play. 28 Years scales back to a tiny cast with minimal story and several subplots that go nowhere.-28 Weeks has one of my all-time favorite opening scenes, probably top 10 ever. It's intense and heartbreaking. I sometimes rewatch the opening scene alone. 28 Years has a rushed opening scene that feels pointless.-28 Weeks shows the infected as terrifying with blood-filled eyes and an excellent representation of rage incarnate. 28 Years turns them gross and nasty, reminding me of hill people from something like The Hills Have Eyes. And it seems obsessed with showing male frontal nudity.-28 Weeks has several types of action and horror scenes. The horror is done amazingly with unbelievably suspenseful moments. 28 Years later is zero scary. ZERO.-28 Weeks has an incredible musical score. 28 Years has an AWFUL musical score.-28 Weeks has an amazing ending. 28 Years' ending made me scratch my head.I basically disliked every direction 28 Years took. There are so many questionable moments or things that make you wonder, \"what was the point of that?\" And characters seem to disappear for extended portions of the movie.I haven't been this disappointed in a long time.(1 viewing, opening Thursday EMX 6/19/2025)",

Once more in collaboration with Alex Garland, like 28 days before it, 28 years later is yet another expansion in this unique vision for a \"zombie\" flick.The filmmaking on display is Boyle at his best. Filming on digital is often frowned upon by film purists. Leave it to Danny Boyle to showcase the strengths of digital cinematography. The frantic editing, the unnerving camera movements and zooms, the contrast rich lighting... All make for an unsettling experience. The night vision scenes, drenched in red lighting are particularly eerie.Thankfully, the infamous \"boots\" poem which helped turn the teaser for 28 years later, into one of the single greatest trailers of all-time (no hyperbole), is incorporated in the film. It's the best scene in the film.28 years later fits right as rain, into the world of the \"Rage Virus\". It tells a surprisingly touching story about survival, anger, fear and love. Nothing turns out as you'd expect and nobody is as they seem. I truly love this film. All the more reason, the last scene of the film legitimately baffled me... It features an event and characters that are at such odds with the rest of the film. Surely, on purpose. But the contrast was annoyingly jarring. What a weird film... But it's fantastic!",

This movie however is disappointing. Alphas just look like Jason Mamoa with makeup.

The cinematography and tone also elevated the emotional weight of the scenes.It's not your typical action-heavy horror flick; instead, it takes its time, grounding the fear in real human emotion and connection.It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for me, it was a rare and refreshing take on the genre.

After the explosive intro to 28 Weeks Later, which ended up being a middling film at the end, I expected much more of a bang at the beginning. I guess that is what they wanted though, to subvert your expectations and subvert them they did.As a horror junkie, I thought I had seen almost everything this genre has to offer, particularly within the zombie genre. However, as the film progressed, Danny Boyle and Alex Garland did things that surprised even me. To my delight, this film ended up being a breath of fresh air.Just when I thought the film was going in a certain macabre and disturbing, but familiar way, it finds a beating heart and shows that humanity is present even in the face of death. It touched me in a way that few films of this nature have and for that I applaud the creators.I refuse to elaborate on the story or anything of that sort, because I feel it just needs to be experienced fresh and new in the mind. I will say the cast and crew do an amazing job, the acting is phenomenonal and the cinematography felt inventive and raw. It helps drive home the story the creator's intended to tell.Overall, a fantastic sequel. Far above what it could've been had they just stuck to the formula. As I said previous, I applaud Danny Boyle and Alex Garland for doing something daring and for keeping it original and authentic. This one will probably go down as the best horror film of the year. I will definitely be in the theater for the next installments to see where they can take this disturbing, but hopeful story.4.5 skulls out of 5.",

There were certainly flashes of what made the original films so memorable - a few tense, edge-of-your-seat moments and some solid action sequences. But as a whole, I found the story disappointingly uneven. The narrative felt clunky and at times weighed down by overly sentimental scenes that didn't quite land emotionally. It seemed unsure of what it wanted to be, and by the final act, it became clear that the film was less about telling a complete story and more about setting up whatever comes next. That left me feeling a bit short-changed. It's not without its strengths, but for a film I had high hopes for, it just didn't deliver.",

            "review": "When the movie tries to be layered it will either work for you or it won't. I get why Danny Boyle and Alex Garland chose this route.This is my personal speculation, but I think Danny Boyle and Alex Garland thought that perhaps after the release of 28 DAYS LATER, there have been many zombie films since (some of which are good and innovative), so they just didn't want to be straight forward or play it safe with 28 YEARS LATER. In doing so, I don't think the film completely delivers on what it looked to promise in both incredible trailers.In truth I did kind of know that going in because after watching other movies from Boyle and Garland, a seasoned movie buff knows they love to subvert so it really shouldn't be surprising. This is also the first in a new trilogy of films. I had to keep that in mind as I walked out because I don't have the big picture just yet.I feel as though Alex Garland had like three ideas, presented them to Danny Boyle and they both decided to mash them up together. A story about coming of age/rite of passage, a bond between a mother and son, and the philosophical idea of death and what it means, almost nihilistic. All in the back drop of survival horror.So that basically made my experience all over the place because it can get jarring. It's ambitious for sure and Boyle and Garland swing big, but I can see it being not cohesive for some people.I'm in the center, but I do lean a bit towards a more favorable outlook and that's mainly because of the actors. I thought Alfie Williams who plays Spike, shouldered this film very well. He is the emotional anchor in the film and he carried it with striking maturity and nuance. There's a slow erosion of childhood innocence and it was very subtle, but also very powerful. The erosion of childhood innocence is also something I think Boyle and Garland has in play for a particular character in the next sequel - a boy named Jimmy who watched Teletubbies as shown in the trailer.Ralph Fiennes is just always good in everything and he's a stand out as Doctor Ian Kelson. I hope we see more of him down the line. Jodie Comer is Isla, Spike's mother who is suffering from an illness seeking out Kelson with Spike. She is also fantastic and anchors all the emotional elements of the film with Alfie Williams. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Jamie, Spike's father I think will have more to do in the sequel, and his character is used in good effect in the beginning of the film. Edvin Ryding's Erik a Swedish NATO soldier is memorable too. Everyone brought their A-game.There are new concepts explored with the infected and the rage virus. While I have a lot of questions about it, they were all fascinating ideas. I'm curious to see those layers get peeled. Good action and some decent scares from the infected too, not to mention also very naked.Boyle loves to experiment with editing and the sped up scenes are here just like in the first film, but there are moments of some awkward cuts in-between. I think people will either like or hate that.The ending is the epitome of weird and jarring, but again, keep in mind that there will be a sequel and hopefully a concluding threequel where Cillian Murphy can come dominate his role as Jim. Speaking of Jim, I don't know if it was deliberate, but the name Jim seems to be a common thing and I am curious if it will have any kind of connection or none at all.So bottom line, yes I enjoyed it. I enjoyed what Boyle and Garland were trying to say and the great performances help alleviate the jarring tonal shifts. However, I understand some of the disappointment, as I am a massive fan of the first, who also really enjoyed the comics in what I think are not canon anymore and mildly enjoyed the sequel 28 WEEKS LATER.This film basically skipped straight to being a thesis film with horror elements. This isn't a one-off indie film, but Boyle and Garland sort of treat it like that. It's part of a franchise with a 20+ year fanbase. Fans want to be re-invited into the world they remember. Give some sense of continuity, not just in lore but also in tone. Then gradually show the new direction.Boyle and Garland made the exact opposite of a nostalgic legacy sequel. They could have played it safe, but if they had and if it failed they risked creating another STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS situation, where nostalgia drives the hype, but the film ultimately lacks a real identity of its own and sets up a trilogy with shaky creative footing failing to evolve.Instead, they forced a fresh, cerebral narrative at the risk of alienating the fans. That's the paradox. It's that classic art vs. Expectation battle and Boyle and Garland chose art, knowing full well the trade-off.28 YEARS LATER is bold and new. I do tip my hat off for Danny Boyle, who thrives in visual and tonal whiplash and Alex Garland who is allergic to clean resolutions or simple narratives. Together they create artful chaos which is this film, but for a film that took over a decade to arrive, a bit of familiar footing first might have allowed the fans and the audience to follow them more willingly into the deeper waters they clearly want to explore.7/10.",

            "review": "In the lead up to the release of his long-gestating return to the \"zombie\" franchise that reignited his career with 2002's 28 Days Later, director Danny Boyle has been quoted multiple times as saying that 28 Years Later is \"not what you'll expect at all\" and having now unleashed his newest venture with screenwriting partner Alex Garland into the wild, it's safe to say he wasn't lying.Without delving into spoiler territory, with Later's distributor Sony doing a fine job at keeping much of the films content and structure hidden before release with some carefully curated trailers and very late critic screenings, Later is easily going to become the most divisive of the series so far with general cinemagoers in particular likely to be both passionate fans and disappointed naysayers in equal measure upon viewing the final product.Centred around what appears to be a relatively predictable set-up of a small family living on a remote island community years after the initial aftermath of the rage virus's ravenous destruction of England and its neighbours, the tale that Boyle and Garland weave around Aaron Taylor-Johnson's committed father Jamie, Jodie Comer's under duress mother/wife Isla and Alfie Williams as their young boy Spike who is coming of age in a world that demands he be older and wiser than his years, is a tale that's anything but a stereotypical one and it's something I would say in confidence when I claim that you've never seen a zombie film quite like Later.Filmed largely via iPhone's , Boyle alongside frequent D. O. P collaborator Anthony Dod Mantle ensure that from a visual point of view also Later looks and feels different to anything we've consumed from a content aspect and when combined with an unapologetically weird undertone and story beats, there's an off-kilter nature to Later that will enthral some and annoy others with audiences being asked on more than one occasion to go along for the ride that Boyle and Garland have designed for us.Managing to keep the same amount of energy and frenzied nature of the classic original entry and its fun if unsubstantial sequel, those seeking an endless barrage of zombie attacks and set pieces may find themselves underwhelmed by Later, as while they're to be found here, an early segment involving a causeway crossing is one of the years most thrilling segments, there's equal amounts of quiet and contemplative elements to this new series addition that includes a sure to be divisive final act that continues to prove both Boyle and Garland are never content to take the easy routes.Front and centre throughout Boyle's unapologetically unhinged big budget experiment are some notable performances with the proven commodities of Comer and Taylor-Johnson doing the type of work you'd expect with the small but significant role of Dr. Kelson that falls to Ralph Fiennes allowing the beloved screen veteran to once more flex his acting muscles with a scene-stealing turn that creates some of Later's most memorable moments.What's perhaps most surprising about the film and the ensemble as a whole is how much weight of the film is put on William's Spike throughout with Later putting him in the thick of it from start to finish with the young performer impressing in a major way with his first lead role, launching what should be a noteworthy career in the industry should he continue to ply his trade.Full of more zombie appendage's, archery carnage, Mortal Kombat like finishes, haunting reciting's of Rudyard Kipling poems and Power Ranger inspired zombie kill squads than one might expect, there's a lot going on within Later's runtime and not every idea and element feels fully thought out or explored but one can't accuse Boyle and Garland of taking the easy route with their high-profile return as far from cookie-cutter as you'll get from a Hollywood release this year.Ending on what's likely to be one of the most talked about footnotes of the 2025 period, one suspects a lot more of the concepts and elements of Later will be delved into further with next January's Bone Temple, the second part to this planned trilogy that has started out with a wild and almost indescribable first entry.Final Say -28 Years Later is going to spark feelings of equal amounts of outrage and love from audiences around the globe with no one likely to be adequately prepared for just what type of film this long in the making follow-on has ended up being.In an age where many known properties are accused of taking the easy option, Boyle and Garland have ensured they can't be placed into that overarching statement.4 fiancée photos out of 5.",

The mixing in of archive clips isn't a particularly groundbreaking move, but it's effective.It's hard to define exactly what subgengre this film belongs to, but there are strong folk horror vibes throughout, and that plays well with the satirical edge to the film (what is it about zombie movies and satire?). As a political statement about 21st century British decline it isn't as over egged as I feared it might be- it's subtle to the point where I wonder whether it can be fully appreciated viewers who aren't familiar with our strange little island.It's easily as tense and bloody as the other two films (although this one is rated 15 which shows you how times have changed). There are some genuinely tense moments throughout.The ending. All I'll say is that however you imagine the last 5 minutes will go, you're wrong.

This had exactly what a good romantic drama should give:\nTrue chemistry, genuine emotion, gorgeous settings, real love, severe heartbreak, and just something that truly sweeps you up and puts you on a roller coaster ride of feelings!It went from warm and fuzzy to devastating and heart-rending very slowly, and so I felt like those feelings all came very naturally and, therefore, all the more heartbreakingly.In other words, this movie was so lovely yet so sad, and it definitely did exactly what it needed to do to have me in a passionate chokehold from start to finish.",

Ever since The Notebook, tons and tons of the cliched, cheesy and annoying romance stories have been made and this one is just the same as every other ones. Director Lasse Hallstrom has made some wonderful movies throughout his career that I have liked but unfortunately, his recent works have been lacking badly and here, his direction and approach feels lifeless and aimless.With stereotypical atmospheres and presentations of Europe, the performances are the best aspects. Cline and Apa offers the best they can have with the clunky dialogue and chemistry, which the two does succeeds as they do offer some good moments, charm, and connections. Alongside with some nice colors and the musical score.Otherwise, that's pretty much it. It's a boring and forgettable romance that you probably forget within a week or so.",

However, despite its promising elements, the movie struggles to maintain a consistently engaging narrative, which prevents it from becoming a truly memorable watch.Madelyn Cline is undoubtedly the film's strongest asset. She delivers a fantastic and natural performance, bringing a genuine charm and emotional authenticity to her character. Her presence on screen is captivating and makes the journey worthwhile, even when the plot itself falters.The film's premise and initial setup are good, hinting at a heartfelt and adventurous story. However, as the narrative progresses, it fails to fully captivate or grip the audience. The pacing can be uneven, and the story seems to meander without a sense of urgency or compelling stakes. This lack of consistent engagement makes the film feel less impactful than it could have been.While the film may have its heartwarming moments and a visually pleasant aesthetic, these positives are often overshadowed by a narrative that lacks a compelling hook. It's a movie that you can watch, but it doesn't leave a strong lasting impression.Overall, \"The Map That Leads to You\" is a good one-time watch, primarily for Madelyn Cline's excellent performance. However, its lack of narrative engagement and a meandering plot prevent it from reaching its full potential.",

In the movie, Heather, the main girl, was all set to start a regular office job after her graduation trip, ready to jump into the typical city life. But who would've guessed she'd run into Jack, that adventure-seeking guy? Their meeting was like two stars on totally different paths suddenly crossing-sparks flew, and it was such a cool vibe.Gotta say, the actors did a great job. KJ Apa, who plays Jack, totally nailed that laid-back, always-up-for-anything energy. And Madelyn Cline as Heather? She killed it with the emotional shifts-from being kinda lost and stuck on her planned future at first, to gradually changing as Jack pulls her out of her shell. I heard the director was super chill on set, no strict scripts, and the actors just went with whatever felt natural. That's probably why the emotions feel so real-it's easy to get pulled into their world.The visuals are stunning too. They filmed in Porto, Portugal, and all these spots in Spain, and every frame looks like a painting. Sunlight hitting the old streets, the buildings with that unique charm, and the wide-open natural scenery-it's all so relaxing, like you're right there on that romantic European trip with them.Story-wise, it's not the kind with big twists or nonstop action. It's more about the little moments between Heather and Jack as they travel, showing how their feelings grow and how Heather starts to find herself. They follow Jack's grandpa's diary map, laughing together, bickering a bit, getting to know each other better-and figuring out who they really are. It's a slow burn, no huge drama, but it has this quiet, gentle way of drawing you in, making you feel all that genuine emotion.That said, it's not perfect. For me, the pace is a bit too slow-some parts drag on, and it's easy to zone out. Also, I wish they'd dug deeper into the characters' inner stuff. Some of their more complicated feelings just get a quick mention, leaving you wanting more. But overall, The Map That Leads to You is worth watching. It's like a light cup of tea-mild at first, but with a nice, lingering warmth if you take the time to savor it.",

Regardless of the other \"Variables\" involved, Polly's dad is a hero. Polly, played by Ana Sophia Heger, makes me wish there was a junior category at all the award shows. Maybe some offer it and they should! The chemistry Polly had with her dad Nate, played by Taron Egerton, is insane. Talk about these two actors going through all the emotions: anger, happiness, sadness, scare, fear, hope, anguish...the list never stopped, and these two actors delivered in spades! It is great to see a big, full cast, all working, and contributing to an excellent movie.The whole cast was fantastic, from the leads, to supporting, to short parts, to one-line parts, to non-speaking parts. Each actor made a contribution to creating a great story. Some of the supporting actors are incredibly accomplished actors! Which, for me, is so necessary in these types of drama, action, thriller movies. Especially when relating to the law and police. Good acting is essential to selling me on these roles. The characters and the cast delivered.Tons of great issue(s) that exist today are going on.One thing is for sure, to see that heroes are inside and outside prison, some in law enforcement roles and some not. As well as some bad people in prison and outside it in law enforcement roles and some not. Power corrupts. So it was excellent for someone in law enforcement actually thinking of justice.The music was fantastic.The location is authentic, not saying it's this state in the USA, but then filmed in some foreign country. Rather, it was filmed in Albuquerque and Zia Pueblo, New Mexico. I've been to the former. One cannot fake these regions by going to some foreign country just for \"credits\" AKA money. Rather do the location(s) justice. This vibe comes off in the movie, it is the location(s) they are talking about. I read over 400 New Mexicans were employed for this movie! That is an excellent job.I don't want to give too many spoilers away.Taron Egerton as Nate gave an Oscar-quality performance, an Oscar-winner.There is some strong violence, heavy scenes. But actually, I cried more in this movie than any movie in recent times. Seeing such a great dad-and-daughter relationship (granted major issues going on) blew me away--that unconditional love only a parent can have for their kid(s) is one of the world's greatest gifts! There is no one more instrumental in a child(ern) life than parent(s).I struggled with the ending, but it was more realistic and authentic than the more sentimental one I wanted!The beginning, middle and ending of this movie were fantastic.",

The subplot involving the local sheriff's drug dealings, the whole operation of 'localised' Meth labs, and the issuance of 'hit marks' feels somewhat contrived and this perception primarily stem from the limited development and materials provided regarding his self-proclaimed 'empire.'",

She Rides Shotgun barrels in with gritty urgency, heart pounding emotion, and two performances that will stay with you long after the credits roll.Taron Egerton as Nate sheds his usual suave charm and instead delivers a tough as nails, tattooed ex con on the run. Ugly world, ugly past, but a man desperate to protect his daughter. Egerton brings such raw, lean menace that you almost forget he once played Elton John. This is character work at its most grounded.Ana Sophia Heger as Polly is absolutely extraordinary. This is one of those rare performances where you stop seeing the actor entirely and only see the character. She brings such honesty, depth, and emotional truth to Polly that it feels less like acting and more like living. Every moment she's on screen is magnetic. She balances vulnerability and strength with a maturity far beyond her years, yet still feels completely natural and age appropriate. It is never forced, never precocious, just deeply human and real. The hardest, most heartbreaking scenes are handled with such grace and rawness that you forget how young she actually is. It is the kind of performance that not only carries a film, but announces the arrival of a major talent. Ana doesn't just keep up with Taron Egerton, she matches him beat for beat and often steals the scene entirely. It is a breathtaking breakout role, and one that people will be talking about for a long time.Together, their chemistry is the heartbeat of the movie. At first you see a scared little girl clinging to scraps of trust, but as the film moves on you watch her transform into a partner in survival. Their bond builds in tiny, fragile steps until suddenly it feels unshakable.Let's talk cinematography. Vast desert landscapes, neon lit motel rooms, hauntingly beautiful sunsets. It's gritty and elegant all at once. The visuals arrest your breath and remind you exactly where you are and how quickly that place can become dangerous.The narrative moves like high velocity noir, leaping from one tense moment to the next. Yes, the plot has familiar beats: ex con on the run, corrupt cops, nasty gangs. But the emotional anchor keeps it from ever feeling stale. It is predictably unpredictable in the best possible way. You may see the scenes coming, but you feel every second of them.In sum: She Rides Shotgun is an action thriller that doesn't just ride shotgun. It drives, bleeding and beautiful, right into your heart. Taron Egerton is phenomenal, but it is Ana Sophia Heger who leaves you floored. Her performance is so believable and raw that you almost forget you are watching a film at all.

But the film's secret weapon is Ana Sophia Heger as 11-year-old Polly... she's fearless without being precocious, heartbreaking without milking tears.Adapting Jordan Harper's acclaimed novel, the screenplay wisely sidesteps sentimental traps that doom similar stories. Instead of sugar-coating trauma, it explores how love can bloom in violence's aftermath. The Aryan Steel gang threat feels menacingly real, grounding the action in consequences that matter.Rowland's direction maintains brutal honesty about what survival costs, both physically and emotionally. While some action sequences feel uneven, the central relationship never wavers. Egerton and Heger's chemistry sells every moment of their unlikely education - he teaches her to fight, she teaches him to feel.The film succeeds because it respects both its characters and audience intelligence.

I had wanted to see it at the theaters, but it got such a limited release that my local theater didn't show it.Anyways - I think this movie has a lot to offer. The story, visuals, and vibe are like a mixture of No Country for Old Men, The Road, and Paper Moon. The 2 leads are great, especially the little girl. There are some sweet father/daughter moments. At the start, they're estranged, and you can easily predict that they'll bond and begin to love one another. Yet that predictability doesn't make their relationship any less satisfying to watch. There is an original closing scene that hits the mark emotionally. The movie is gritty and hard-htitingSome issues linger though -- The soundtrack is weird at times. The pacing drags a little; I honestly got bored or restless a few times. The movie does a poor job with the villain, the God of Slabtown. They try to set him up as this big, scary final boss, and this effort fails for several reasons, ranging from the casting to the writing. I also would've cast someone different for the police officer who helps the protagonists7.0/10.",

But the rest encompassed a long drawn-out and uninteresting plot, weak characters and a dramatically stupid ending that is just too typical of Hollywood.How in the world do these movies garner so much attention and positive reviews? It's just baffling. While the filmmakers did assemble a cast with some known actors in Taron Egerton, Rob Yang & John Carroll Lynch, the overall effort was just such a waste.Point the fingers at writers\nBen Collins, Jordan Harper & Luke Piotrowski for a poorly conceived storyline that relies on Heger's acting and typical gimmicks, cliches and shallow folly to carry it through. Bad on them but all too typical of Hollywood filmmaking these days.",

It's the Michael Jordan of cinema: there will never be another 'Jaws,' simply because the film so profoundly changed the way movies are made and marketed.Based on Peter Benchley's bestselling novel, 'Jaws' centers around the fictional North Atlantic resort island of Amity, which finds itself terrorized by an enormous great white shark. Our hero is Martin Brody, a New York cop who took the job as Chief of the Amity PD to get his family out of the city and then finds himself in the midst of an unprecedented crisis none of his prior experience has prepared him for. The remains of young Christine Watkins are found on the beach, the apparent victim of a shark attack(Chrissie Watkins' death scene at the opening of the movie is one of the most legendary in the history of film). Chief Brody wants to close the beaches, but is refused permission by Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) and the Amity selectmen, all of whom fear that news of a shark attack off of Amity will threaten the summer tourist trade, on which the town depends for its very survival. The Mayor and his lackies persuade Chief Brody that such incidents are always isolated, and, inexperienced in such matters, he grudgingly agrees to keep quiet.Consequently, the shark kills again (and again), and Chief Brody eventually finds himself dealing both with his own moral guilt for agreeing to hush up the first shark attack and with an enormous human and social catastrophe which appears to be his sole responsibility. Help comes first in the form of Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, in the role that propelled him to stardom), an icthyologist and oceanographer dispatched to Amity to lend his expertise. Together, Hooper and Brody struggle in vain against both the shark and Mayor Vaughan, who is certain that keeping the beaches open for the sake of the town's economy (and his own real-estate business) is worth the gamble.Finally, Brody and Hooper charter an expedition with the enigmatic, vaguely malevolent Quint (Robert Shaw), Amity's most feared and respected shark hunter, to find and kill the shark and save the town from financial disaster. What ensues is an epic, archetypal man vs. beast quest that would make Herman Melville and Joseph Campbell proud. Our shark, it turns out, is way above average size, terrifically swift and powerful, and uncannily smart, to boot. Hooper, the scientist, is awestruck at having encountered the Bigfoot of the sea; Quint, the crafty fisherman with a serious chip on his shoulder against sharks, realizes he has met the ultimate test of his skills; Brody, who swims poorly and is afraid of water, must overcome abject fear and disorientation just to maintain his composure.Robert Shaw's Quint is one of the greatest anti-heroes the movies have ever seen. He is funny and frightening all at once, and the famous soliloquy in which he recalls the tragic sinking of the USS Indianapolis--where, over the course of a week waiting for rescue, at least 90 US Navy personnel died from shark attack wounds--is one of the most chilling and unforgettable performances ever committed to film.'Jaws' is the movie that made Steven Spielberg's career, and it's among his finest. It's easy to forget because of his enormously successful blockbusters that Spielberg is a phenomenally skillful and artful director. His timing is superb, he mixes horror with comedy to brilliant effect, he gets great performances out of his actors, and his love for special effects has never overwhelmed his understanding of the importance of story and character.That said, the most brilliant aspect of 'Jaws' was a serendipitous accident.The special effects team had yet to fully troubleshoot 'Bruce,' the mechanical shark, by the time filming was to begin. Under tight budget restraints and enormous studio pressure, Spielberg had no choice but to press on while his crew labored vainly to make the shark work in the cold and corrosive north Atlantic seawater. To compensate for the absence of the non-functional fake shark, Spielberg used shots from the shark's point of view and John Williams' famous two-note theme to create the illusion of the shark's presence in the early scenes. Fortunately the crew was ultimately able to get Bruce into operational status in time to film the big showdown, and some of the scenes are filled in with live-shark footage filmed by Australian underwater video pioneers Ron and Valerie Taylor. Consequently, the audience's fear is magnified by the fact that, for the majority of the film, they cannot see the shark, creating suspense towards the climax of the confrontation between man and beast on Quint's fishing boat.'Jaws' succeeds on almost every level. It is terrifying without being grotesque, and spectacular without being unbelievable (if the shark looks a little fake, remember that, at the time 'Jaws' was released, 'Space Invaders' was on the cutting edge of computer graphics design and there was no such thing as 'Shark Week on the Discovery Channel'). Roy Scheider's Brody is a quintessential everyman, an average guy beset by fear and guilt who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances and rises to the occasion. Dreyfuss' Hooper is brash and brave enough not to come off as nerdy or self-righteous, and his friendship with Brody becomes the backbone of the movie (Spielberg and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb wisely deviated from the novel in regards to the character of Hooper, who was originally Brody's nemesis). Robert Shaw's Quint is a modern-day Captain Ahab, a worthy foe for the malevolent shark. The suspense is potent and the action thrilling, but the humor, emotion, and character development make this movie much more than a summer blockbuster.",

            "review": "This is the movie that started it all. I'm not talking about the Hollywood blockbuster, or the insane madness that sent thousands of misunderstood Great Whites to their deaths, I'm talking about the beginning of my interest in movies. This is the movie that did it. I couldn't tell you how old I was when I first saw it, but I do remember this is the movie I made my parents rent time and time again when we went to the video store. This is the movie that drove my parents and some of my friends nuts while I watched it day after day after day when my mom gave it to me for Christmas. This is the movie that made me want to turn a real interest in the movies from just a hobby and into a career. For that, I owe Spielberg, Benchley, Scheider, Shaw, Dreyfuss, Williams, Fields and everyone else a sincere and heart-felt thank you. I own this movie on every format in which it is available. I love it that much. I've probably seen it between 200 and 300 times. I guess you can say it is an obsession. A sick obsession. The plot, the pacing, the editing, the score, the acting, and, oh yes, the shark. Who cares that is fake? By the time we finally get to see it, do we care? Truly, a more suspenseful movie was never made. Several come close, but none quite reaches the primal level the JAWS does. No other film so effectively taps into our fear of the unknown, and then gives it a riveting score to boot. No other movie grips us so strongly with heart stopping suspense that we find ourselves nearly falling off our seats. And no other movie leaves us feeling so spent and wasted after a viewing. And the reason for all the fear, suspense and emotional withdrawal is not top-notch special effects. It was the mid-70's. You can barely apply top -notch to anything of that era. The reason the movie does all that to us is that it is a great story. It is filled with real people, who have real jobs, and who have real fears. And who must now confront a real shark. Can you think of anything more terrifying that getting on a rickety, leaky boat to kill a 25-foot shark when you already have a paralyzing fear of the water? I can't. And Martin Brody sure can't. And so, no matter what ranking JAWS may get on AFI's list of the 100 greatest movies, or TV Guides list of the top 50 movies, or any list for that matter, JAWS will always come in number one on mine. Steven, Peter, Roy, Robert, Richard, John, and Verna -- thank you. Not for just giving me a sense of direction in my life, not for just making me want to be a screenwriter, but also for making a movie that still thrills me as much now when I watch it as when it did when I saw it for the very first time.",

            "review": "Jaws is a movie the I grew up with, it's like the first real horror film I ever watched. What a great one to start with, right? This movie not only scarred me out of the water, I was afraid to go to the bathroom! I thought Jaws was going to pop up out of the toilet and bite my butt! :D I know it was silly, but that was how much Jaws effected me. I know also that it has not lost it's effect to this day. I'm questioning, because it seems like all the terrific horror films came out of the 70's.Jaws is based on the best seller book by Peter Benchley. Steven Spielberg, before he was STEVEN Spielberg turned this horrifying book and made it into a reason to hate sharks. He brilliantly took what could have been a cheesy movie and turned it into a classic that will never be forgotten. To this day, I still need a friend to hold onto, it's that score! Duh na... duh na.... dun dun dun dun.... Oh, my gosh, that music just scares the heck out of me! On such a low budget, Jaws not only turned into one of the greatest horror movies of all time, it turned into one of the greatest movies, period.Jaws starts off with one of the most terrifying scenes in horror movie cinema, a young pretty girl goes into the water and is brutally attacked and killed by an unknown creature in the water. The next day Chief Brody investigates suspecting a shark attack, and urges the mayor, Larry Vaughn, to shut down the beach, but afraid of a panic and less tourists, Larry ignores the chief's suggestions and keeps the beach open leading to another attack on a young boy. Brody calls in Matt Hooper, a marine scientist to see if they can find the shark. But when another attack ensues and almost kills Brody's young son, Michael, he, Matt, and a cocky man, Quint go out to find Jaws themselves.This turns into several of the greatest cinematic scenes of all time, like the \"Indianapolis\" speech brilliantly given by Quint, how he describes seeing his first shark was just so intense and you couldn't turn away from the screen. Then, one thing that is interesting about this movie, you do not see the shark until Brody is just chucking blood to attract the shark over his shoulder and Jaws appears roaring out of the water! \"We're gonna need a bigger boat!\" he replies to Quint. And then the scene where Jaws jumps onto the boat and Quint is trapped sliding into Jaw's, well, jaws! That's the scene that nightmares are made out of! Jaws is one of my favorite films of all time. It's one of those films that should never be missed, because it is so important. To many, including myself, the shark looks fake, but it's your imagination that gets with you. Spielberg embraced that and you could tell there was just something special about him. Jaws will scare you out of the water just like The Exorcist scared you to the church!10/10",

            "review": "Widely regarded as the film that began the \"summer movie blockbuster era\", JAWS (1975) was also rightfully one of the year's most critically acclaimed movies. It was also the recipient of an Academy Award Nomination for Best Picture and a winner of Oscars for film editing (Verna Fields) and music score (John Williams).  One of the reasons the film received no acting nods is that everyone involved is so good, how could one single out just one or two? (I personally feel Robert Shaw should have gotten a Best Actor nomination, however). Roy Scheider is wonderful as New York cop Martin Brody, who has relocated to a small coastal island town, only to have his bad case of \"aquaphobia\" put to the ultimate test. Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly cast as a shark expert and provides some truly funny comic bits along the way. Lorraine Gary (who director Steven Spielberg says was the first person to be cast for the film) does an excellent job of being the concerned wife and mother. Finally, there's Murray Hamilton, who gives one of the best performances of his career as Mayor Vaughn, who seems to be more concerned about the economy of the town than the safety of the residents. In a way, Vaughn is really the film's villain. Solid cast indeed. The screenplay (by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb) is tight and well-written, as is Spielberg's direction. Whether it was the mechanical shark's failure to operate correctly or Spielberg's decision to simply see less of the shark until the end of the film, the \"less is more\" idea works perfectly, particularly in the opening scene, which is chilling to this day.One thing I do want to add: if you choose to watch this film at home, do yourself a favor and rent or buy the WIDESCREEN version. The full-screen pan and scan version is a travesty that ruins the great camerawork that Spielberg and cameraman Bill Butler made. I always recommend the widescreen version but it is especially important for JAWS.No offense to fans of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, but this is the film that should have taken home the Oscar gold.

            "review": "Reputationally-speaking, \"Jaws\" will forever be known for two things: director Steven Spielberg's unique \"shark-eye view\" camera work and building of suspense, and composer John Williams' two note \"attack\" motif that became as iconic as any piece of music ever created. Perhaps those two aspects alone would have been enough to make \"Jaws\" an iconic film--who knows. But the fact is, this 1975 effort is about so much more than just suspense/horror. It is one of the most well-rounded, complete movies ever made.For a very basic overview, \"Jaws\" tells the story of the coastal town of Amity, which suddenly and inexplicably becomes the hunting grounds for a rogue Great White shark. Sheriff Brody (Roy Scheider) wants to close down the beaches until further notice, but is opposed every step of the way by city official Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), who worries about the potential loss of tourist business. When the attacks continue, however, Brody enlists the help of shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and grizzled boatsman Quint (Robert Shaw) to help hunt down the giant predator.As stated, the general premise and music here are well-known. But what always strikes me with each \"Jaws\" re-watch is how much it is a human drama as opposed to a horror piece driven by a villain (the shark, in this case).The first half of \"Jaws\" takes place almost entirely \"on land\", if you will, and focuses more on the politics of fear and commerce than anything supernatural or scary. If there are ever any doubts as to whether that material holds up, they can easily be put to rest after viewing the film through a pandemic context. Substitute \"global contagious disease\" for \"mindless, unstoppable shark\" and it's as relevant today as ever.The second half leans more towards \"adventure sea chase\", and is buoyed by ocean scenes that, despite being filmed 45+ years ago now, do not seen old or outdated in the least. Masterful cinematography almost always holds up, and Spielberg's behind-the-camera decisions certainly do here as well. Even then though, in the midst of a brutal and thrilling chase, Spielberg stops the action for a touching scene in which the three seaman bond over song and shared experiences.In order to fully exhibit such depth of character, great acting is required--and given here in spades. \"Jaws\" features a collection of unique characters that are always a joy to revisit. Scheider as the \"why-won't- anyone-listen-to-me!\" sheriff lets viewers relate to the story in a much more personal aspect, while Dreyfuss' Hooper is insightful, hilarious, and provides some of the best dialogue of the whole show. Of course, Shaw as Quint is singularly iconic, juxtaposing jocularity and complexity perfectly within his single character.Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give \"Jaws\" is that every time I see it, I can't help but be swept away in all its winning aspects. Whether it be the drama, emotion, music, thrills, adventure, visuals, acting, or just overall heart of the piece, there is not a single scene wasted or underutilized. I have absolutely no doubt that it will remain just as visceral of an experience going forward as it was for those sitting in the theaters in 1975.",

My daughter (whom is 17) and I were both stunned at the quality and realism of a film made in 1975!! Our TV is 55 inches which showed the movie off to it's full potential and it certainly did not disappoint.That iconic moment of the young lady going skinny dipping in the dark with her male friend is utterly haunting. You know the horror of what's going to happen, the buoy dinging in the background gives you the chills. Steven Spielberg captures pure terror in that scene.Jaws completely absorbs you, as the trio of shark hunters venture off to try to snare the great white you begin to feel part of their adventure. You fear for them, get excited with them and dread what will happen next. When that fishing line starts spinning your heart starts pumping. This is pure class.The dynamics of Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw's relationship(s) work brilliantly. The differences in their characters persona's is such that they rub each other up the wrong way, disrespect one another and wind each other up but in the end they are there for each other and develop a bond that I think surprises them all.As things begin to unravel your heart goes out to the trio and trepidation is the only way forward. They have the fight of their life on their hands, their bravery is boundless. You feel in awe of them.An absolute legend of a movie which I am grateful to have been able to watch and enjoy.",

Running to the back of the house and turning all the lights on were just a few things I resorted to after watching the opening for the first time!!! I Never watched anymore of it until 1-3 years later. I was highly hesitant because to a young child, a skinny dippers suffering to the wrath of the giant unknown mouth was the most horrifying sequence in film history at the time...and it still is now! Once I finally got the courage to view the film, I was still in for a lot of surprises. The cinematography is superb in its ruthless attempt to bring the audience to the depths of a powerful ocean, and to the eyes of the dark, wretched creature the inhabits it. The story of the killer shark attacking the unfortunate island in the world is more than scary. It could have been any place in the world, and it had to be Amitty Island. The shark could have easily lost it's way in the swaying currents of the ocean, but as the opposite inhabitants of the beach get angry, this big mother is here to stay! The technique is wild, absolutely wild, and John Williams score earned more than an Oscar for it! Creepy piano notes enter this films titles, and the blue depths of the uncharted territory beneath the sea let us all know that no sense, however small, was to be spared. The first victim, alone will haunt those who view it for the rest of their days, and the rest of the story is more like a battle. This strange battle is often more focused on understanding the other side. What Brody, Quint, and Hooper must do is plunge into the depths themselves, and seek out the unruly monster of the sea. The common theme in this terrific classic is survival, and why not? Survival is a natural instinct to all animal alike. The shark must survive, as it makes so clear by snagging unsuspecting swimmers, but also the people, they to have to survive, but the island is not big enough for both man and fish together.

Yet before the Dinosaurs, Holocaust, Peter Pan, UFO's, and Indy there was the Shark. Jaws represents one of the masterpieces on Spielbergs resume. It is also probably the \"Quintessential Spielberg Film.\"Jaws was very popular when released, it was the gighest grossing film of 1975. It spawned three sequels, which were all inferior. In fact, no film about Sharks or any killer fish has been able to come close to the level of Jaws.The genius in Jaws is its ability to build suspense. The Shark is never really shown till near the end of the film. When ever the Shark is approaching its victims, we get the Sharks point of view, instead of seeing the Shark. These POV shots combined with John Williams very effective score, make the scenes when the Shark is about to devour his victims much more effective.Evry actor does a nice job with their performances. Roy Scheider brings Martin to life. Martin is not a showy character but Scheider is able to make us like him. Richard Dreyfuss exhibits energy in his performance as Matt Hooper. Robert Shaw is very effective as Quint, that Indiannapolis speech is still very chilling to me. Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton also give solid support.People always talk about how fake the Shark looks. I think its passable but today it would definitely be done by CGI. However, the Shark is not seen that much in the film so its not that big of a deal.I would like to say Jaws is Spielbergs best film, Schindlers List closely follows. But I would like to see Close Encouners and the Indiana Jones films again. I did not like Close Encounters the first time, and I like the Indiana Jones films but they never stood out to me.

But to my utter disappointment, this movie doesn't even match the quality of TV shows we see on cartoon channels. I couldn't bear to watch those 360p-quality animations on a big screen. Had I known it was this mediocre, I wouldn't have watched it even on TV-let alone in a theatre.Now, coming to the main reason I strongly urge everyone not to show this to their kids: the entire film is filled with noise, shouting, anger, and violence. I would personally rate it as suitable only for viewers aged 15 and above. My kids, aged 6 and 9, got so frustrated with the noise that they almost fell asleep-thankfully.I don't blame the makers for this mediocrity, but rather the audience that made it a big hit. It just shows how much we lack discernment-AI-generated videos today are far better rendered than the animations in this movie. Forget the animation-even the basic screenplay and dialogues are so poorly done that I couldn't bear to sit through two hours, which honestly felt like twenty. The entire second half is just one sacrifice after another, testing the limits of your patience.If you truly care about Lord Narasimha, you're better off watching Bhakta Prahlada (1967).",

It doesn't try to modernize or dramatize mythology for entertainment - instead, it honors the scripture with spiritual sincerity and cinematic grace. The narrative follows the story of Lord Narsimha, the fierce yet compassionate avatar of Vishnu, with such reverence that you feel transported to a different realm.The visuals are grand, yet not overdone. The music elevates the emotional and devotional essence of each scene. The performance of the actor portraying Lord Narsimha is powerful and awe-inspiring - a true embodiment of divinity and justice.What truly makes this movie special is its bhav (emotion). Whether you're familiar with the Bhagavatam or not, the purity of the storytelling touches something deep inside. It's not just a story of a mythological event - it's a journey of bhakti (devotion), dharma (righteousness), and anugraha (divine grace).",

I took my 3-year-old child along, hoping it would be a wholesome and engaging experience centered around one of the most revered avatars in Hindu mythology. Unfortunately, what we encountered was nothing short of a disaster.From the very beginning, the film lacked the charm and finesse one would expect from a modern animated production. The animation quality was extremely poor - the character movements were stiff, the environments looked incomplete, and the visual effects were substandard. It honestly felt like a rushed project with very little attention to detail. The direction also felt immature and disorganized, as if the creators lacked a clear vision of how to narrate such a powerful and emotional story in an engaging manner.Moreover, the emotional depth and intensity that the story of Narasimha demands were completely absent. Instead of feeling inspired or moved, both my child and I were confused and disinterested throughout the film. It was clear that the movie failed to connect with both kids and adults, which is unfortunate given the spiritual and cultural significance of the subject.In comparison, there are several other Indian animated series and movies like Little Krishna or Bal Ganesh that are far superior - both in terms of animation and storytelling.",

The movie states nothing about the state of the kingdom in hyranyakashyapa's rule and goes full on black and white with prahlad being the good guy and his father being the bad one.

            "review": "Narasimha Avatara, the film appeals to millions of hindus across the globe. It's a classic tale of a devotee, who worships his Lord instead of his father. His father starts persecuting him, failing in every attempt finally to be ruthlessly killed by Lord Narasimha.Its a film that will obviouly win the heart of millions of hindus, who are waiting to avenge someone for thousands of years. But the question is do they understand fully the message imbibed in the story ?Leaving aside the dialogs, set-ups, animated effects, VFX and other technicals aside because it's mostly imported from west. Instead we stay pointed on the content, which requires more attention considering the socio-political conditions of our country.In hinduism every one has it's own Istadevta, which is true for Prahlad, who chose Lord Bishnu. Lord Bishnu as the preserver and protector saved Prahlad from Death every time his father persecutes him. But that issue isn't explored in detail. It only showed that Prahlad is safe. Isn't it a metaphor ? The authors of our scriptures didn't explore on this issue, of how Lord is mindful of His devotees. It should display themes like patience, love, wisdom, faith in issues of Lord. Instead it showcased how Lord is Vengeful. The mode of killing Prahlad's father is terrifying. And that's where Hindus are satisfied. It satisfies the violent tendencies hidden in the Hindu character. I think it shouldn't be the case, instead it should have explained how generous, kind and loving Lord is, despite persecutions going on for centuries. But it showed reverse.The film is titled Narasimha instead of Prahlad or Lord Vishnu. Why ? Because it's all about vengeance, which makes it a pessimistic animated film, just like grave of the fireflies. Some obviously will like. But give a second thought about it.Ramayana: the legend of prince Rama 1993 was a positive film, but why was it banned in India ? It's shouldn't be. It was positive themed film showing morality. But banning anything that leads us to morality is persecuted everywhere and India is not an exception.",

I've seen the actress play the bum before, but this takes the cake. What little screen time the mother has, she really leaves a bad taste in your mouth.So back to the story. Our protagonist is having a lot of difficulties making ends meet, we are shown her true colors in that she's a high class \"working girl\", balancing two other jobs, one at a bar and one in a factory; and even with her extraordinary good looks, she is still not able to make ends meet.

Adapted from Willy Vlautin's novel, the film plunges viewers into a high-stakes, emotionally raw quest as Lynette (Vanessa Kirby) races against the clock to secure her family's future in a rapidly gentrifying Portland. What I loved about this movie was its tense, ticking-clock atmosphere and urgent pacing; every frame brims with suspense and desperation as Lynette scrambles overnight to raise $25,000, making tough choices and confronting her past. The story beautifully balances grit and empathy, adding layers to its social commentary about housing insecurity and class struggles.The cast is simply phenomenal. Jennifer Jason Leigh delivers a quietly devastating turn as Lynette's unreliable mother, Doreen, showing a complexity that deepens every family scene. Zack Gottsagen is moving as Kenny, Lynette's brother, whose innocence amplifies the stakes and heartbreak, and together, their performances ground the story in vulnerability and hope. But the reason I was truly captivated is Vanessa Kirby. She dominates the screen and brings such emotional urgency, versatility, and empathy to Lynette that I couldn't look away. Kirby channels every stage of desperation, pain, and resolve with a haunting depth; she's the beating heart of the film, making every moment memorable. The chemistry among these three, especially Kirby's dynamic with Gottsagen and Leigh, represents the best of ensemble acting, elevating a tense genre drama into a resonant journey about family and survival.It is a deep dark social commentary centered on one woman's struggle to survive and rise above. It is not pretty, it is not a Hallmark movie, It is realism, sadness and desperation at it's raw core and yet it is the triumph of survival and the eternal hope of a better life.",

This time, we have a movie featuring a desperate protagonist, a victim, about to suffer a major setback. She faces the need to fight to keep what she has, guarantee her future, and have a dignified life. But in this scenario, which we can describe as uncreative or novel, many excellent opportunities are wasted when they could actually enrich the work.There is a promising background that supports and sustains the movie. The protagonist suffers immensely, living in an unbalanced, dangerous, even deadly situation, assuming the legitimate role of victim of a cruel system. Of course, the system is cruel because not everyone enjoys satisfactory financial conditions, and the results are disastrous. But the causes of this situation are not addressed. This leads to the uncomfortable fact that the movie refuses to criticize the system, as if it were natural. Thus, the background that drives the protagonist's decadent journey is undermined, largely due to an incredible lack of creativity.The conflicts are overly inflated and reach a narrow dead end, becoming diluted and losing solidity throughout the story. Thus, it's clear that the movie has a valid premise, but it's shallow, clueless, and poorly written. In other words, the unjust system that afflicts the protagonist is essentially impersonal, random, and, most dramatically, irreversible. Everything revolves around the protagonist's suffering. This is what drives the story, summarized in less than 24 hours. The Night Always Comes is, therefore, shallow. At best, and if generosity is appropriate here, it's dispensable.",

I love the actors, particularly Vanessa and Jennifer, and was looking forward to it. And then.....meh. There's a scene toward the end where the actresses look at each other and you can hear the director in the background saying \"tell the story with your eyes,\" and you get long stares. At the end of the day, I didn't buy the lead's dopey decisions and none of it was realistic but there were a couple well-paced entertaining action scenes. But I didn't buy any of it.

            "review": "Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.",

And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.  Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.  Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him.  Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.

Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in \"The Shawshank Redemption;\" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Citizen Kane.\" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time.Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame.But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.",

This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\".The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.",

Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink.

The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.",

When I say \"The Movie\", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about.  In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those \"Budget Theaters\" over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said \"That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!\" There's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... \"HOPE\".  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just \"comes together\" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a \"must buy\" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, \"That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!\"  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my \"favorite of all time\", but they've all fallen far short of \"The Shawshank Redemption\". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the \"employee picks\" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!",

Regrettably, as is true in so many cases, popular opinion is an inaccurate gauge of this picture's actual quality. The reason this film has attained its current level of acclaim is that it is impossible to misinterpret its theme or message, impossible to be offended by it, impossible to be confused by. However, as this review should show, it is entirely possible to be unimpressed by \"Shawshank.\"The story of Shawshank Redemption is something I might expect if I was being pitched a script by middle schoolers. The complex coincidental frameup, the daring escape, the clear cut definitions of good and evil. the timeless friendship finally and uneventfully consummated on a beautiful shoreline. Each step more unsurprising than the last, each beat more clichéd that the last. Every time the filmmakers feel like building tension or revealing something about the characters, they take the most obvious road. This might be excusable if the road didn't also lead to the most obvious destinations.People also praise the acting in the film. While it isn't at all bad, it's hard to be impressed when the actors are playing such simplistic roles. Stereotypes when acted well are still boring.I sincerely hope that over time, when the film has settled into history and once people are more able to set this pandering film along side its heavily plundered predecessors, it will become clear that it offers nothing new, and that what it does offer it doesn't even offer all that well.",

How did a movie as bland as The Shawshank Redemption become so overrated?In the case of certain other movies, I can at least understand the reasons why they're overrated. But The Shawshank Redemption is so... average. And cliché-ridden. The film's moral is basically that hope is important, and there's nothing wrong with that in itself. Heck - I have no problem with simplicity. The problem is when you move past the simple and into the land of the simplistic. The movie treats its borrowed plot parts (Count of Monte Cristo, anyone?) and banal themes as though they were freshly minted nuggets of wisdom. (I wouldn't be complaining if it didn't pretend to be anything more than a pleasant diversion.) However, it is with its very last shot that the movie reveals its true condescending colours. If it had ended moments earlier instead, with that poetic shot of the sea, I would have had some respect for it (that's where the superior original story ends). But no, the director had to spell things out for his audience. Frank Darabont knows how to tell a story. He just doesn't know how to tell one with any originality or depth.The movie is partially redeemed by three things. The majestic cinematography, the powerful score, and most of all, Morgan Freeman, one of the very best actors working today.As for my rating, yes I'm one of those jerks who gives a movie a 1 just to lower it on the top 250.

I liked Eve's character more than I expected to, and even though he wasn't in the movie that much, I did enjoy the scenes with Norman Reedus as Daniel Pine. The amount of action sequences in this movie is insane, mostly every second of this movie, we get more and more action without being able to take a breather. This might just be the most action-packed movie of the franchise yet, right next to John Wick: Chapter 4. Overall, Ballerina is exactly everything you could ever want from a John Wick spinoff.

Other than that it's pretty mid, the dialogue is as stupid as usual, but I guess since the entire premise of the movie is killing people then it doesn't really matter. However, some of the fighting was stupidly unrealistic, like the whole grenade scene. The film is just another excuse to make another 3 movies out of a spin off, but I guess if you're into movies that have mindless violence, then this should be music to your ears.",

Keanu Reeves as always....his presence in the film is so strong.OVERALL: It really fits the description \"from the world of john wick\".

It's clear to see where the reshoots come in as they appear copied and pasted in.Ana De Armas is the saving grace of the movie and gives a great performance while Keanu has a fun cameo with just the right amount of screen time. It's a shame to say that Gabriel Byrne is wasted as the villian and doesn't do much with the time provided.The world of John Wick is a brilliant concept and continues to enthrall.

But Ballerina does something slick - it leans hard into Eve (Ana de Armas' character) and redefines what it means to fight like a girl. Spoiler: it doesn't mean holding back.While John Wick is a surgeon with a gun - all headshots, no wasted motion, like he's got a built-in aimbot - Eve dances to a different beat. Her combat style is scrappier, grittier, and gloriously unconventional. Remember the advice she gets early on? Fight like a girl. And trust, Eve took that to heart - but not the way you'd think. She weaponizes unpredictability: grenades, fire, fists - no kill looks the same. It's a brutal ballet, and she's the prima.The action is top-tier - you'll get your gun-fu fix - but Ballerina also sneaks in a solid story, giving Eve space to be more than just a shooter. Plus, without spoiling too much, we get a cameo from a certain dog-loving assassin that keeps the Wickiverse connective tissue strong - the kind of storytelling Marvel wishes it could still pull off.If you're an action junkie, do yourself a favor: catch this in D-Box. You'll be dodging bullets in your seat, vibing with every explosion.Final verdict: 4 out of 5 stars. Ballerina doesn't just hit - it dances circles around your expectations.",

It had been a while since i was in the theatre and missed many movies i would had otherwise go watch a few years ago but i had to make an exeption for a John Wickesque movie.After The Continental wich was alright but nothing special to me, i was hoping it would go back more on what make John Wick stand out and im happy to report it does.Sure the plot is very simple, and by now we are used to this world, but you are there for the action right? And this one deliver ! It brings the classic Gunfu we love and add some new amazing elements that had not been done before. By the 5th movie in the franchise, its pretty cool to be able to do so.Yes Eve is a little small to fully portray that killing machine standard we got used to by this universe, but this is where suspending your disbeliefs get into place. I enjoyed that she also take a beating herself in many instances and don't come out scratch free of every fights.This movie introduce a new \"faction\" to the John Wick Universe, wich it keep a little vague for now (wich is fine, they can always expand in the sequels) while also expanding the lore about the Ruska Roma.Now is Eve as charismatic and \"epic\" as John himself? I would say not quite, but the movie aknowledge that itself. Its a new character and Ana gave her 100% to it and i am sure they will make many more of these in futur years. And bet i will be there to watch them.Definately will be adding this one next to my other Wick movies on my shelves.Oh i almost forgot. Funny enough Daniel Bernhardt who played the main henchman in John Wick 1 is also in this movie as a new character. His role is quite small this time so we don't get much if any infos on him but you can kinda make your own lore that maybe he is the twin brother of the character in the first movie.",

It looks like Ana de Armas must have worked very hard to be able to perform in these scenes. Her efforts deserve respect.The plot of the movie is extremely simple. Perhaps if it had been slightly deeper and more interesting, the movie would have been better.Another criticism is that our 50-55 kg main character takes extremely heavy blows from men but recovers in just a few seconds. This wasn't believable or realistic. Similarly, our main character is too emotional to be a death angel.The grenade scenes were over-the-top and even absurd, but the flamethrower scene was the most entertaining.The duration of John Wick's scenes may exceed your expectations, but that's a good thing, It was nice to see him.In summary, if you've watched and enjoyed the John Wick movies, you should watch Ballerina.

It starts with the young \"Eve\" (Victoria Comte) who witnesses her father's death at the hands of \"The Chancellor\" (Gabriel Byrne) before being adopted into the secret society of \"John Wick\" by \"Winston\" (Ian McShane) and his drag-like boss (Angelica Huston) where she learns to combine the artistic skills of a ballerina with deadly ninja ones - as she morphs into Ana de Armas (whilst everyone else remains exactly the same). Anyway, none of that really matters as she accidentally discovers the identity of the tribe who ruined her life and despite warnings of dire consequences, sets off on a lethal mission of retribution that takes her to a Czech Republic where everyone speaks perfect English. The thing is, it appears that her gang and the one she is pursuing have a sort of unwritten truce, and given she is about to throw that under the Skoda, Angelica has no choice other than to bring out of retirement the legendary you know who. Will that make anything any different or safer or even less repetitive? It not so much that this is derivative and really quite dull, it's that the dialogue is woeful and the constant frying pan to fire scenarios where people get used and abused are ridiculous. Knives, guns, bottles, pots, pans, kettles - even a pair of ruthlessly applied roller skates and some flamer throwers help our heroine along but it's hilarious that they always appear just when she needs them. She's got the points and gone up a level, She also heals as if she were the sister of \"Wolverine\" and no amount of training is going to remove a six inch shard of glass from your body without it impeding your ability to scale a wall and wield a pick axe. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood, but just like the series upon which this is based, it is unoriginal and after the umpteenth time she has survived against innumerable odds to fight again just had me wondering how long until she's back with \"Ballerina II - the Pirouette\". All of that said, though, it does look good on a cinema screen and that's where it ought to be seen.

Third, there is something about the lighting of many of the fight scenes. They just don't pop. They don't give you the ooh factor. They just seem redundant as if they ran out of ideas.

John Abraham's latest offering, Tehran, has him playing one of the most complex and riveting characters in his several-decade-long filmography. Over the last few years, John has organically steered towards geopolitical stories and characters that aren't just another spy or part of a covert agency.In 'Tehran', John's character, Rajeev Kumar, gets involved in a very complicated case when a bomb blast in Delhi targeting an Israeli diplomat kills an innocent flower-seller. The incident disturbs Rajeev Kumar to such an extent that he decides to put his life at stake to get to the bottom of the matter.Set against the backdrop of the Iran-Israel conflict, the film examines how ordinary people become collateral damage in someone else's war. Unlike many thrillers in the genre, 'Tehran' doesn't exploit the premise; instead, it sensitively shows every possible facet of the price one has to pay to wage a war.The screenplay by Bindni Karia, co-written with Ritesh Shah and Ashish Prakash Verma, is the film's strongest asset. Dialogues peppered with Farsi lend authenticity, while director Arun Gopalan draws solid performances from his cast. Neeru Bajwa and Manushi Chhillar make their mark in supporting roles. But, 'Tehran' works because of the conviction that John puts into his role. One of his finest performances till date, the film is a testament that, with a good script and a visionary director, all an actor needs to do is just surrender and keep faith.A standout is Hadi Khajanpour as antagonist Asraf Khan, who is an absolutely brilliant find. He is not just menacing for the sake of it, but also a sharply etched, powerful character.The way the film has been shot visually is also impressive. From the dusty lanes of Delhi to Abu Dhabi, the camerawork is brilliant. The action sequences feel very organic and real, with combat scenes that are gritty and extremely tense.Tehran is a masterclass on how to deliver Deshbhakti without lehraa-oing Tiranga or chanting Jai Hind on the Independence Day! It celebrates the unsung heroes, who are mostly abandoned by their countries for being on missions that are either off-paper or not approved at all!Whenever John Abraham is an alone man on a mission, he comes out with a brilliant result-be it Madras Cafe or Tehran. With its intelligent script, the film becomes an absolute must-watch for anyone who appreciates quality storytelling and has the patience to research on international relationships and politics before diving into the film.",

Looks like many scenes were shot here and there and then joined one after the other without much coherence on the editing table. Even John Abraham looks clueless and doesn't know why he is there. Maybe he understood after shooting a couple of scenes what a mess of a script he has gotten himself into. Gunfight scenes seem over the top and in most cases not required. Scenes involving diplomats and back channel discussions involving different agencies seem to have been shot just for the sake of having some scenes with diplomats wining and dining; they are without much depth and substance.Also, I believe the makers chose zee5 as a poor choice to release. The platform lacks technology for good streaming experience. Maybe primevideo and netflix backed out after reading their script.If you are not a John Abraham fan, you can simply skip this one.

The plot is tight, layered, and refreshingly free from overused tropes, focusing on real stakes and complex moral conflicts.What truly impresses is the film's ability to build suspense not through flashy action, but through atmosphere, emotion, and character-driven storytelling. The performances are understated yet powerful, making every moment feel believable. The direction and cinematography further enhance the gritty tone, placing viewers right in the heart of the action.Compared to other blockbuster spy movies, \"Tehran\" is a breath of fresh air. It redefines the genre with its raw aesthetic, smart writing, and commitment to authenticity. For those seeking a genuinely gripping spy drama without the excess, \"Tehran\" is highly recommended.",

            "review": "Arun Gopalan's espionage thriller carries a distinct urgency, fueled by a charged political backdrop and anchored by a commanding lead performance from John Abraham. The film crafts a tense atmosphere that blends realism with cinematic flair, leaning into the paranoia and claustrophobia of covert operations. Much of the impact stems from its cinematography, which favors tight framing and sharp contrasts to heighten unease, often shifting between shadow-heavy interiors and wide, almost desolate exteriors of Tehran. This visual design underscores the sense of isolation at the heart of the narrative, giving the film a stylistic edge even when the storytelling takes familiar turns.Abraham delivers one of his stronger recent performances, balancing physical presence with moments of emotional vulnerability that ground the high-concept stakes. Manushi Chhillar proves effective as more than a supporting figure, demonstrating nuance in a role that resists being reduced to a stock character. Meanwhile, Hadi Khanjanpour injects gravitas into the film's antagonistic thread, lending complexity to an otherwise rigid political conflict.The pacing occasionally struggles, particularly in its midsection, where momentum dips under the weight of repeated strategic maneuvers. Yet the screenplay recovers with set pieces that feel immediate and dangerous, marked by handheld camerawork and stripped-down sound design that amplify tension. The score, though conventional, supports rather than overwhelms, leaving space for the actors and visuals to carry the drama.While not revolutionary within the genre, the film benefits from its ability to balance action-driven sequences with moments of moral reckoning, refusing to paint its characters in absolute shades of black and white. At its best, it captures the suffocating uncertainty of a man trapped between hostile forces and abandoned loyalties. A compelling if uneven spy drama, it earns its place as a solid entry in the canon of politically tinged thrillers.",

From start to finish, it reeks of laziness, incompetence, and an absolute lack of respect for the audience. The writing is beyond awful-whoever penned this script should reconsider their career. It's full of the most predictable, uninspired dialogue imaginable, with characters so lifeless they make mannequins look expressive.The pacing is a disaster. Scenes drag on with no tension, no purpose, just empty filler designed to stretch the runtime rather than tell a compelling story. It's like they had one decent idea-an evil monkey-and stretched it so thin it completely disintegrates. There's no depth, no complexity, just a mind-numbing sequence of events that fail to build anything meaningful.The horror? Nonexistent. It relies on the cheapest jump scares possible, the kind that aren't scary so much as obnoxiously loud. Not once does it create actual suspense or psychological unease-it just throws noise at you and expects you to be impressed. The direction is soulless, the cinematography bland, and the vibe/humor so depressing that it's almost laughable.But what really pisses me off is how obviously low-effort it all feels. There's no passion, no creativity, no reason for this movie to exist other than to cash in on people's love for Stephen King's name. They didn't care about making something memorable or interesting, just about pumping out another piece of disposable content to clutter streaming services.I can't imagine anyone with a shred of taste sitting through this and thinking it's remotely acceptable.

And yeah, the premise is silly: A monkey bangs a drum-someone dies. But instead of a serious horror film, you get an over-the-top horror-comedy that tries so hard to be funny that it eventually gets in its own way.The movie actually starts off well. The first deaths still have some shock value, the characters are entertaining, and there's a bit of that Final Destination appeal where you're curious about what's going to happen next. But very quickly, you realize: there's no real tension. Every death is just a setup for a joke. The first time it's funny, the second time too-but by the eighth time someone randomly explodes and the others just shrug it off with an \"eww,\" it gets old.And that's the problem. The film mocks horror clichés but doesn't offer anything thrilling itself. Scream proved that you can perfectly blend horror and comedy by keeping both elements grounded enough. Here, every serious moment is immediately undercut by a dumb joke. Even themes like the strained father-son relationship or the threat of the monkey carry zero weight because nothing in the movie has real consequences.The second half starts to drag. The jokes repeat, and at some point, the film just feels like a series of TikTok skits where people die in the most absurd ways possible. The ending is the lowest point. I won't spoil it, but it feels like the writers had no idea how to wrap things up-so they went with the cheapest and dumbest option.Is it a bad movie? No. It's entertaining if you just want to turn off your brain and enjoy some absurdity. But it could have been so much more if it had taken itself even a little bit seriously. As it is, it's a fun idea that eventually runs out of steam.",

Don't get me wrong - I'm all on board for this expansion of the short story. I love the idea of the totem object that could possibly be a deity or god of some sort and how it follows the brothers into adulthood.What I was sold was not what I got. I would say it compares to the use of the monkey drum toy for the poster of the film Monkey Shines (1988) by George A. Romero. Which is to say - they have nothing to do with each other - one is used to sell the other - and it's misleading. I blame the trailers. The Monkey - in terms of a film - is closer to a real bloody version of The Cable Guy (1996) or Very Bad Things (1998). If you go into the film expecting the tense horror/suspense of Longlegs, you'll end up a sad monkey.As I walked away from the film I think I would have really enjoyed it if it was marketed more as a dark comedy (and sure some of this blame is on me as a viewer to do my research). As it stands - if you've seen the trailers you've already seen 90% of the suspense in the film. What you haven't seen is the absolute mayhem and chaos that surrounds those situations. I think the first 10 minutes of the film tells you exactly what it is - how the humor works - and how it plays out through the monkey.If you're on board with the opening - it's a perfect roller coaster. My problem was that I thought I was on a rollercoaster and instead ended up tripping on a bunch of banana peels. Regardless, I think the film is worth viewing (and to continue using animal innuendos) you might find it a hoot! But in the end, the film is just monkeying around with the audience.",

This movie was fascinatingly bad.The dialogue was stale and stilted and made no sense, the trope of the monkey itself made no sense with no lore or background or mystery, the acting was eerie and strange and didn't make sense (and 2 of the 3 good actors in this movie die or are never seen again within minutes), the dialogue was atrocious, there was a group of cheerleaders that celebrated every death that was never explained, the comedy was atrocious (although you can laugh at how bad certain scenes are), and the overall story was just plain stupid. I will say that the direction, set design, cinematography, and lighting were all great but didn't fit the rest of the movie's extremely poor quality. The deaths were ok. But a few, especially the second one, weren't even practical from a freak accident perspective.I went with a date and we left the theater with our mouths open at the fact that we'd seen probably the worst movie we'd ever seen, and not in a fun way. We met three couples outside the theater who were also talking about how bad it was and how confused we were at the good reviews it was getting.

I did not know it had so much comedic moments but it worked as a perfect blend between the gory and serious parts of the film.I found the design and look of the monkey itself to be pretty creepy and I dug the idea that it was some entity or God-like being. It was reminiscent of the Annabelle doll from the conjuring series. However, I feel like the monkey brought a more menacing and brutal aspect to the \"spirit\" or \"haunt\" sub-genre.I did enjoy the first act probably the most when our protagonists were teenagers and discovering the brutal powers of the monkey. I felt like there was more emotional connection in this part opposed to the second and third acts once we got the time jump.The highlight of the film was definitely the comedy, gorey kills and production design. The film looked and sounded good.The main downfall was when the time skip occurred, the emotional connection was lost between the characters and I wasn't as invested in the final act.However, in saying this I thoroughly enjoyed this dark comedy, it had some great horror moments and great kills (I'll be looking out for the kill count)7/10 Drum beats 🥁",

I figured I'd give Perkins another chance to impress me; given that I enjoy most films based on King's work, I thought I would have a better time with this one. I have to say that while The Monkey isn't as unfathomable or as dull as Longlegs, I was more disappointed by it since I actually had my hopes up.I can't remember too much about the original story -- it's been a while since I read it -- but Perkins has clearly done some serious expanding on the tale, and let me tell you... he is no King. His script for The Monkey is light on genuine horror, leaning heavily into the comedy, but I guess that me and Perkins just aren't on the same page when it comes to what is funny. The majority of laughs are intended to come from the ridiculous Final Destination-style death scenes; I love OTT gore, but found the film's cartoonish Rube Goldbergian demises predictable (too much was shown in the trailer) and dumb, with CGI that looked horribly dated.

This film blends supernatural horror, dark comedy, and absurdity in a way that feels both ridiculous and wildly entertaining. It's a film that knows exactly what it wants to be; an over-the-top, blood-soaked thrill ride that makes you laugh even as you cringe at its gruesome kills.What sets The Monkey apart from its influences is its surprising dose of humor. Horror comedies are tough to pull off, but this film manages to create an odd yet satisfying balance between gory chaos and weirdly charming absurdity. You're not exactly belly-laughing, but there's this strange, undeniable urge to smirk and chuckle at the madness on screen. It has the energy of a violent children's fairy tale. Think of a silent-era slapstick comedy, but with splattering blood and twisted fates. It's bizarre, but it works.Now, let's talk about what horror fans are really here for; the kills. And The Monkey delivers. It's gruesome, creative, and wacky in the best way possible. The deaths feel like something conjured from a child's chaotic imagination; illogical yet strangely poetic. The Monkey itself, this cursed toy at the center of the carnage, has a mischievous, almost gleeful way of orchestrating its victims' fates. If you love the elaborate, almost Rube Goldberg-esque deaths of Final Destination, you're in for a treat. It's all so over-the-top that it somehow becomes hilarious. The violence is exaggerated, stylized, and so absurd that it loops back around to being entertaining rather than just shocking.Then there's Theo James, the ever-dashing star who's given the impossible task of playing an insecure, jittery father. And let's be honest; this man is too effortlessly suave for that. No amount of nerdy costuming can fully strip away his natural charm, and while he gives it his best shot, it's hard to fully buy into his transformation. He does a decent job, but there's a lingering sense that he's slightly miscast.As for the story, it's simple... maybe too simple. The Monkey doesn't aim for deep narratives or complex character arcs. It moves along swiftly, focusing more on its chaotic spectacle than its plot. But credit where it's due: the film isn't just a copy-paste horror template. Unlike Wish Upon, which follows a predictable formula, The Monkey throws in enough surprises to keep things fresh.That is, until the third act. This is where the film goes off the rails, not necessarily in a bad way, but in a 'Did we just jump the shark?' kind of way. It tries to up the stakes but ends up pushing the absurdity a bit too far. The motivation behind certain character decisions feels weak, and it loses some of the controlled chaos that made the first two acts so enjoyable.Still, despite its flaws, The Monkey is a damn good time. The suspense is solid, the kills are outrageous, and the execution of horror-comedy is commendable. Could it have been better? Sure. A slower, more tension-filled buildup to the deaths would've elevated it further. But as it stands, it's an undeniably fun horror flick that doesn't take itself too seriously.Verdict: The Monkey is a wild, ridiculous, and gory thrill ride that embraces its absurdity in the best way possible. It's like eating a sour candy; sharp, intense, but with a strangely enjoyable sweetness underneath. While Theo James struggles to shed his natural charisma for his role, and the third act goes a little off the deep end, the film remains a thoroughly fun and entertaining horror experience. If you love blood, chaos, and dark humor, you'll have a blast with this one.",

Even that would be fine if the director really had a flair for jaunty black comedy--something like early Coen brothers--or spectacular bad-taste slapstick. But he doesn't, so this just comes off as one dumb gag after another, played out by characters who are all cartoonishly one-dimensional, so there's zero emotional stake in their fates.I enjoyed at least some of Perkins' prior movies, but this reminded me that the weakest thing about Stephen King books and writing is when they're trying to be funny (think \"Maximum Overdrive\"), which is not his strong suit. It's better crafted than a lot of low-budget movies in a similar vein, but given that it's not particularly low-budget and involves some talented people, its ideas should be better than that of your average lowbrow gore comedy.

Any mystery left within the film is stripped by this need for a quick gag.What takes this film to being a 1/10 is the addition of the most on-the-nose moralising about life.

This films use of gore and shocking deaths was very enjoyable, however as the film went on it lost some of that gory, disturbing and almost haunting effect that it had on me to begin with. In a way the deaths and the film as a whole towards the later half became almost comedic and got many laughs from the audience aswell as me. Overall this film could be classed as a comedy horror. The first half was brilliant it set up a good background to the children and the monkey itself, it created this anxiety in me that I was about to be horrified.

The final result is a little bit of a disappointment, it aims to be an edgy, black comedy horror, most of the time it's just underwhelming.There's nothing new here, everything done here has been done before, better, in terms of pacing it is too slow, it takes ages to get going. I'm not too sure it knew what it wanted to be, I couldn't take it seriously as a horror, I wasn't expecting to yawn my wah through.On the plus side, the monkey looks awesome, I love the look on its face, especially when the lighting is dark and subtle, plus the period details are great, the early scenes look spot on. One or two of the scares looked good, very Final Destination at times.Fair to say all of the best material was crammed into the trailer, most of the material just wasn't up to much. They certainly made a great trailer, sadly they exhausted all of the best bits.Theo James does a good job, he adds a bit of life into the part and is as handsome as ever, sadly some of the other performances are a little lifeless.Overall, it's somewhat disappointing.6/10.",

I thought the representation of Amber's grief and the lesson of balancing that with the good was powerful, and they went about it without trying to dismiss or \"fix\" her in the end (as can be surmised from the previews that that's the direction it would go). From an adult perspective I thought it was great.But as it were, I took my 5 and 8 year old, and deeply regretted not looking to the reviews further before seeing it, thinking I could blindly trust an Angel Studios movie to have a PG movie actually be appropriate for little kids. (I was originally not going to take the 5 year old, but we ended up having a spot to fill last minute) So the lower rating is because the misrepresentation is quite problematic.As many reviews have said, it had such a strong horror movie tone to it, dappled with the lighthearted moments seen in the previews. There were definitely some laugh-out-loud funny parts, but much of it had even my 8 year old freaked out and hiding behind covered eyes. I think he'll be alright, in the end he said he liked it, but it's not the sort of experience I want for my kids.To me though the worse part was the unexpectedly frequent swearing. We have been really diligent about that and my kids came away with some new words they haven't heard before. Which really wouldn't be so bad if they didn't relentlessly repeat everything they hear. Not the sort of thing I'd have expected to experience from this studio, so I was really disappointed with that.Basically, this is just a warning to parents with small kids to always do your homework and make the effort to check content before seeing a movie, despite what studio it's from.",

There's a lot going for it; I saw this movie at TIFF and the announcer mentioned that director Seth Worley has a background in VFX - it shows.This movie - the fourth such imaginary creatures come to life movie in 2024, weird ain't it - has some truly impressive CG creations. The movie may be low budget, but the art style of these creatures lends itself well to simple creations. They have texture and make sense in the context of the story, and are undoubtedly the best part of the movie.Tony Hale is also really good in this, it's nice to see him in a leading man role and I think he plays this character - a grieving single father - quite well. He seems to be the most balanced character, despite film's characteristically snarky script Hale gets a lot of great sentimental moments.The movie also has a good message and manages to tie itself up quite neatly and in a way I think all good family films should. It explores complicated emotions pretty well. It's a movie unafraid to get creepy at times and really reminds of how family films used to be; often tinged with darkness, because ultimately, life isn't all sunshine and rainbows.I think what bothered me most about this movie was the script. It's a funny movie, yes, but you know when someone just can't tone it down and keeps cracking jokes, to the point where it's exhausting? I feel like Sketch has that problem. There are also A LOT of \"wait, did you just say ____,\" jokes that occur WELL INTO the final act that I just found tiring after a while.The movie also has kids. A lot of them. Two of them, the main boy and girl, are fine. They still can't help the movie's overly \"MCU\" tendencies of winking and joking at every opportunity. But there's one kid - Bowman - who gets WAY too much screen time and I find super obnoxious by the end of the movie. I'm sorry - he's not a great actor and he doesn't know how to interact with the CG creatures. There's a scene where he's supposed to be covered in them where it's evident he doesn't really know what he's looking at and it's super distracting.There was also a noticeable issue with the sound; too loud and too quiet at times. Maybe it was my theatre, but I suspect it was the mixing. I feel like the movie's score was honestly pretty bad; it never really captured the tone it was supposed to go for and reminded me more of Evil Dead Rise than anything...which just didn't fit.Overall, this is a fun movie, and it really reminded me of family adventure films from the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s. We definitely need more of these, but this is a debut film and it has the hallmarks of a director to watch for, but who is clearly just starting out.",

I did not find it \"demonic\" or \"evil\"I found it as the opposite actually I saw it as a heartwarming movie. One of the biggest points of this movie is when the brother says you're not a bad or evil person just because you drew an bad monster. This movie really does highlight that kids do not know how to regulate that emotion. They need to know that it is okay for them to have strong feelings. They need to know that it is okay for them to be angry upset or sad. They need to be reassured that it's normal if somebody makes you mad sometimes you want to smack them (that's normal even as adults we do the same thing don't lie when somebody makes you mad in your mind you're setting there thinking dang I really wish I could smack this person) it's a normal response.

This information turns out to be crucial for understanding the rest of the film, and frankly, that first quarter could have been stronger. But that's for the writer/director to ponder. If you go to this movie and expect that we need to learn through exposition a lot of backstory, that's ok, because the payoff later on is whimsical, beautiful to view, a bit scary for very younger children but very fulfilling for older children and maybe tweens.It shows the depth of imagination, the proper channeling of emotions, the way that both kids and adults learn about themselves in the world, and how to navigate potentially fearful situations.PS - stay for the closing scenes during the credits, so you can discover how to participate in some of the CGI magic of the film.",

And thats what movies are for.Firstly, for those who do not know, this was filmed during lockdowns which may have had an impact on the quality in general and how the film was shot.Secondly IMDB is wrong, its 90 mins not almost 2 and a half hours, but maybe the length got cut due to lockdowns, I have no idea.Thirdly (tertiary), I wont go into other reviews too much as no opinion is wrong, all such media is subjective but having said that, reviews giving one or two out of ten I feel are not being objectively honest.Now the film, no spoilers.This is very loosely an H. G Wells reimagined modern day telling of the story from mostly one persons perspective, it relies almost 100 percent on the use of the internet, teams video calls as the medium to tell the story, obviously this originally aired via the radio which was the medium of the day and I felt that this modern day telling was relatively accurate to how I would imagine this would go down today.It does help if you have at least a basic understanding of how the above mentioned forms of software are now being widely used to communicate with each other, and if you have not had any access to video calls and the internet in general, I can see how this would be hard to follow as other reviewers have stated.The effects of the film are clearly rather low budget but they tell the story adequately, just dont expect blockbuster style effects.The script, is in places a let down. The story itself is very rushed in places, for example, the main character drastically changes his life's views and opinion in a couple of seconds which is simply not believable and a little cringe.A couple of switches in the narrative of the movie also stand out as a \"Really????\" moment.Having said all of this, I went to start watching as I saw the first several reviews giving a 1 or 2 out of ten, calling it the worst film ever and I honestly was expecting to turn it off after 10 minutes once my urge to see just how bad it can be was scratched.I watched the while film, and I was honestly entertained.If you are ok with somewhat basic rushed and a little cheesy script and effects that really do look like mediocre CGI at best, the story and the new take on this old troupe was enjoyable.This will win no awards, but it was different, I liked it, I am glad it was made and that I watched it and decided to write this review to counter the rather harsh one and two star reviews.For me its a 5 to 6 out of ten, I should point out I am quite a harsh scorer, almost every film I have seen, I rate one star lower than IMDB does.Give it 20 minutes, if you dont like, dont carry on.",

I know I'm guilty of C, but truly it mostly due to the fact it reminded me of some of Steven Seagal's end-of-career movies in that it's so horrifically bad/sad/woeful/embarrassing that you literally cannot take your eyes off it for fear of missing the next level of sigh inducing head shaking. In some respects it does keep the audience on edge with the interest of \"just how bad can this get from here?\" and this is the one area where the movie does NOT let you down.The best irony is that this installment is titled \"Revival\", which would lead you to believe that there is a return to stature or something, but this edition does nothing more than leave you with the feeling that it should have been left alone and Cube and Eva Longoria will enjoy the albatross references of their association to this movie for years to come.",

This 2025 remake isn't a film-it's a cry for help wrapped in a Teams call, sprinkled with alien noises, and served lukewarm via a Prime subscription you forgot to cancel.Let's start with the aesthetic. Imagine if a GCSE media class was told to make a sci-fi film using only screenshots, bad Wi-Fi, and a laptop with 2% battery. Now remove all humour, tension, and character development-and give Ice Cube a webcam and a plot he clearly didn't read. Voilà! You have War of the Worlds: 2025.The filmmakers-visionaries, I presume-have boldly decided to tell this epic tale almost entirely through video calls, file searches, and screen recordings. Because nothing screams cinema like watching a grown man mutter \"Can you hear me now?\" while an alien invasion supposedly unfolds offscreen. Hitchcock used suspense. Spielberg used wonder. This uses desktop notifications.Ice Cube stars as a sort of cyber-survivalist dad with the emotional range of a fax machine. He spends most of the film yelling into various devices, occasionally squinting at an alien threat that we're told is terrifying but which mostly looks like a Windows 98 screensaver gone rogue. I kept waiting for him to say, \"Alexa, save humanity,\" but alas, even that would've been too engaging.Eva Longoria phones it in-literally. Her performance is 40% lag, 60% existential regret. You can actually see the exact moment she realises she's trapped in a movie that feels like it was directed by Clippy, the old Microsoft Word assistant: \"It looks like you're trying to make a sci-fi film. Would you like some help?\"Plot-wise? Picture a disaster movie written by ChatGPT after one too many espressos and a broken caps lock key. The story unfolds (or rather, oozes) through dialogue that sounds like it was ripped from corporate training videos: \"We have to initiate the data protocol!\" \"Reboot the firewall!\" \"Send the drone!\" I kept expecting someone to share their screen and walk us through a pivot table.Then, just when you think it can't get any worse, the film goes full infomercial: a literal Amazon Prime delivery drone becomes a crucial plot device. I swear on Spielberg's beard. The world is ending, and the hero has to buy a gadget on Prime to fix it. I half-expected a pop-up: \"Customers who bought this item also saved civilisation.\"To be fair, a few reviewers online called it \"underrated\" and \"thought-provoking.\" I can only assume they were bots, bored interns, or sentient toasters trying to assimilate into human culture by watching the worst we have to offer.Watching this film felt like being slowly strangled by ethernet cables while Clippy cheers you on. It's not just a bad film-it's a philosophical event. A meditation on the futility of time, money, and broadband. A reminder that just because you can make a movie entirely on Zoom... doesn't mean you should.Final verdict:\nIf you've ever wanted to experience what it's like to die of secondhand embarrassment while waiting for a buffering screen to load the apocalypse, War of the Worlds (2025) is your masterpiece. For everyone else, I recommend looking at a turned-off TV for 90 minutes. More tension, better acting.",

Every dragon - from Toothless to the fire-covered Monstrous Nightmare - looks incredibly realistic and faithful to the animated designs.The music hits hard emotionally. Scenes like the sand drawing, flight training, the romantic flight, and the final battle with the Alpha dragon are breathtaking.Visually, the landscapes and Viking setting are on another level - rich, immersive, and cinematic.-What would I change? Honestly? Nothing. This is how live-action adaptations should be done.

Can I remind you that these guys have been on a creative streak - mixed in with some admittedly subpar work - with the likes of The Wild Robot?This is the studio that KNOWS how lighting, colour, expressions... every little detail right down to how the voice actor says the specific lines is what makes movies truly great. That an simply plot can be made so much more when you really put some effort into it.Yet this bring us this garbage, and everyone swarms around it, because...? Nostalgia? Just rewatch the original people, because this is inferior in every sense of the word. It's like someone sprayed DreamWorks with an amnesia spray. They no longer understand what made the lighting work in HTTYD. They no longer understand what added so much character into the voices of these characters. They no longer understand why Toothless and every other dragon was design the way they were. Now every dragon looks like a very basic dragon toy - and here I thought they were trying to make this more realistic? - and everyone sounds and looks so generic.I thought you guys were against live-action remakes, because they butchered everything, but here you are, rating this soulless cash grab TEN stars? What the hell? How is this ten stars? Can we please remember that 10 stars generally refers to a masterpiece... which this is not? I mean, it just objectively isn't... it's down to the technique and the fact that it is just a poorly re-skinned rehash.And if you so badly want to watch a live-action version of this, I believe there is a play of this. Go support that, instead of this. DreamWorks doesn't deserve you throwing money for effort so minimal the levels are in the negatives.Let's hope this weird trend of 8, 9 and 10 star reviews doesn't continue. Because there are movies who at least did something genuinely, meaningfully different that somehow have lower ratings. And this thing doesn't deserve it. Nor does DreamWorks deserve to think that this live-action remake thing should be a trend.They could've just made a live-action adaptation of the books.Have a little self-respect, or maybe even respect for this \"new generation\" that this is also probably the excuse for this new movie that didn't need to be made.

            "review": "Like every other live action remake, How To Train Your Dragon (2025) falls short in many ways compared to its original source. Primarily, the dragon designs are all... awful, to say the least. From uncanny, to awkward, to horribly ugly, they turned the most visually interesting parts of the original film into strange Game of Thrones knock-offs. Silhouette\nAnother visual design choice I cannot fathom is why so much of the original atmosphere is muted or straight up nonexistent in the remake. Hiccup wandering through the forest, searching for Toothless after shooting him down... in the original, the unease and mystery of this scene was amplified by a dense misty forest and cold gray clouds looming overhead. Meanwhile, the remake has him strolling through a sunlit forest with vibrant colors. The color choices in many other scenes are strange, and sometimes make the backgrounds look like they're filming a stage production instead of a movie.As for the story... they read did just shot-for-shot remake the entire movie with a few minor changes + worse composition and framing. Can't say much other than it really shows how little this movie needed to be made. You want an interesting, heartwarming story? Watch the original film. There's no reason to watch this one instead, since they added nothing new of substance. They even managed to cut out small details (Toothless' pupils in his when Hiccup finds him shot down, the way he reacted when Hiccup first attached his prosthetic tail fin, the illustrations in the Book of Dragons moving, etc.) that make some of the most iconic scenes from the OG far less interesting.In many ways the visuals were awkward, so was the acting. A lot of scenes when Hiccup interacts with Toothless feel stilted and give off \"the actor waiting for cues\" vibes. Very little of it feels organic. Remake line deliveries pale in comparison to the original and the dialogue is worse all around. In many scenes where the dragons were quick and snappy to punctuate shocking moments or jokes, they instead move sluggishly and stiffly. Toothless alone feels far more like a real, living animal in the 2010 film than he does in the remake.No matter how bad they get, these live action remakes will rake in millions of dollars from nostalgia-blind fans and clueless newcomers. It's frustrating. We deserve better than this. I'm afraid they've already announced the second film will be churned into a Live-Action remake as well...

            "review": "The 2025 How to Train Your Dragon live-action remake is, quite frankly, one of the most unnecessary and uninspired retellings of an already-perfect story. This film doesn't just walk in the shadow of the beloved 2010 animated classic-it awkwardly tries to mimic it, scene by scene, line by line, yet completely misses what made the original special. It's like watching a high school stage play of a Broadway hit: technically the same plot, but stripped of all the emotional nuance, wonder, and magic.From the opening minutes, it's painfully obvious that this remake is a shot-for-shot copy of the original. Rather than reimagining or reinterpreting the material for a new audience or medium, the filmmakers seem to have opened the original script, made zero meaningful edits, and simply recast the scenes with live actors and awkward CGI dragons. And yet somehow, despite following the exact same blueprint, they manage to drain the soul out of every single moment.The original How to Train Your Dragon was a masterpiece because it had heart. It captured complex emotions like fear, empathy, courage, and growth in a way that resonated with both kids and adults. The bond between Hiccup and Toothless wasn't just cute - it was profound. You could feel their connection. Every scene had purpose. Every visual was alive with color, energy, and soul.This remake, on the other hand, feels sterile. Hiccup, now played by a live-action actor who seems perpetually unsure whether he's in a fantasy epic or a CW teen drama, lacks the charm and vulnerability of his animated counterpart. Astrid is there, and she says the same lines, but the chemistry is missing. The Vikings? Forgettable. Even Stoick the Vast, who was once a towering, emotionally complex father figure, now just feels like a generic grumpy dad cosplay.And then there's Toothless. Oh, Toothless. One of the most expressive, beloved characters in modern animation has been turned into a CGI creature that looks like it escaped from a PlayStation 4 cutscene. In animation, Toothless was full of personality - his subtle head tilts, cat-like movements, and wide eyes told stories without words. In this version, the CGI is so uncanny it's distracting. It's as if they focused more on rendering realistic textures than capturing character. You don't bond with this version of Toothless - you just stare at him, detached, wondering why he looks so off.There's no sense of wonder here. The cinematography is flat. The color palette is muted. The flight scenes - once soaring, heart-stopping sequences that defined the magic of the original - feel weightless and artificial. Even the score, while still beautiful in theory, fails to hit the same emotional highs because the visuals and storytelling simply don't support it.Worst of all, there's no reason for this remake to exist. It adds nothing new. No fresh perspective, no updated themes, no bold direction. It's just a dull, lifeless replica that hopes nostalgia alone will carry it through. But nostalgia isn't enough when the original is still easily accessible - and far better in every single way.Remakes can be wonderful when they honor the source while offering something new. This does neither. Instead, it plays like a studio boardroom decision brought to life: safe, predictable, and painfully hollow. If you're a fan of the original, do yourself a favor and skip this. Rewatch the animated trilogy instead - it's still soaring far above this crash-landed mess.",

' and it still comes back to it's a cash grab.There is nothing new, they have basically lifted the cartoon scene by scene into 'live action' i.e. A real person with a lot of CGI around them.So essentially your watching an identical film to the cartoon, telling the exact same story in the exact same way. .Mildly irritating was they had to give a little lecture on inclusivity and diversity. Stoic (Butler) did explain that all the 'tribes' of the Vikings had come together (which explained the diversity of the population).Curiously one of the few scenes they omitted from the cartoon, was the one where Hiccup learns with the baby dragons, they don't like eels and they can be burnt by fire into their mouths.This was an important scene, as it explains how, in many ways, Hiccup defeats the Queen. So you need to have seen the cartoon.Don't get me wrong, the live action is a good film, CGI is impressive, the acting is good.Again the question \"Why am I seeing the exact same story again?\" jars the whole viewing experience.I would give this film a 6.5/10 It is a 'good film' just a totally unnecessary one.Would I watch it again ? No, I would much prefer the original.",

There's \"slightly\" more realism and the fact that the hero of this film seems vulnerable makes it more interesting; Bob Odenkirk does look like an everyday day guy in this film. But the action scenes and the fights are excellent and he does an excellent job nailing them! The film starts off well, somewhat slow and picks up faster pace within 20 min. Right at that point, there is one scene which is rather stupidly set-up to give way for the rest of the story...the one with the bus...but later things do improve. The bus sequence is excellent action, don't get me wrong. It's just the way it was setup prior to the action. But... don't look for any script/scene consistency...just enjoy. Runtime is excellent for this genre; just 1h 30min, it never ever gets boring.

Call it the John Wick school of cinema.Maybe as an eleven-year-old this may have worked for me. There is a ton of killing and mayhem in this, but none of the violence has any real consequences so there is zero in the way of tension.If they could have toned this down about one thousand percent, it may have made for an OK movie. Maybe kill about 300 fewer people and it would have been slightly more...I won't say believable, but slightly less idiotic.Along with the Motion Picture Association rating, they should include a body count for all movies. This one probably has more deaths than a movie of the Battle of Gettysburg. Isn't murder fun! And we wonder why we have such a violent society. Forget about the fact that it looks like they shot this movie on a ten-year-old smart phone with a dirty lens cap, and the writing seems to have been the work of an unpaid intern, people seems to love it, so what do I know?",

This follows the same case as John Wick. The first John Wick was good, but they killed it with the sequels. They should have stopped after the first one. \"I Am Wrath\" is also another good movie and better than this one.I have already seen good vigilante movies in the past. Death Wish and The Exterminator are prime examples of good movies that have survived into the present era. Vigilante 1983 starring the late Robert Forster and Fighting Back 1982 starring Tom Skerrit are also terrific.In Nobody(2021), the story follows a family man played by Bob Odenkirk(of Breaking Bad fame) who fails to stop some inept burglars from stealing his possessions. After which he has a change of heart and lashes out vigilante-style to vent out his anger. The rest of the movie deals with repercussions of his decisions.The acting in the movie is so-so.

Crafting an interesting and hilarious fun screwball-like comedy. Many of the characters are portrayed as annoying, quite unlikeable, and ridiculous, but what makes it work is because of Covino's direction and how the movie understands the self-awareness of how ridiculous and hilarious the setting and characters are. Which is why the characters worked as their chemistry and dynamics are great.The performances from Kyle Marvin and Covino were both great, alongside with Dakota Johnson and Adria Arjona.

Unfortunately, despite his undeniable talent, he felt underutilized in a script that lacked depth and nuance. The dialogue was particularly weak, often falling flat and leaving the actor with little to work with emotionally or dramatically.The story seemed intended to immerse us in the character's frustration and grief as he searched for those responsible for his wife's death. However, this emotional core never quite landed. The relationship between the main character and his wife wasn't developed enough for us to truly feel the weight of the loss. The early scenes meant to establish their bond felt forced and lacked any real passion, which made it harder to invest in his motivations later on.What's more frustrating is how much time the film spent on elements that didn't serve the story, while barely touching on those that could have added emotional depth and weight. The pacing and focus felt misplaced, detracting from what could have been a much more powerful narrative.On the technical side, the cinematography was quite strong - it's clearly a well-shot film. However, the color grading choices didn't always work in its favor. Many scenes were overly dark, making it difficult to follow what was happening, at least on the cinema screen where I watched it.Overall, The Amateur is a decent choice if you're looking for something to fill a lazy Sunday afternoon.

Heller just wants his bosses to do the right thing: murder the murderers. When they won't, he sets off to do the deed in a revenge plot from someone who can't pull the trigger, but can do so much worse.I generally don't watch trailers, but I did happen to catch this one and it did spark my interest. It did seem very formulaic, clichéd and predictable...and then I saw the movie. Remy Malek already won an Oscar for Bohemian Rhapsody and frankly, deserves another for this role.He really was THAT good. Everyone else, standard and did their role. Remy gave it his all. Never once did I not believe ALL that he was going through with his plot for revenge against his wife's murderers.And for him to remind me of one of my favorite action/spy trilogies of all time (The Bourne Identity/Supremacy/Ultimatum) that's a welcome surprise. I actually found myself wishing this was part of Jason Bourne's universe.This was SUPER SMART, advanced, intelligent and still simple enough to follow along.

Perhaps this was partly because it felt like there was a lot omitted along the way, not clearly showing us how he was able to accomplish what he did. Maybe some more scenes showing him having to figure out how to get to where he needed to be in order to sabotage something would have been good (like in the swimming pool scene). But since this movie was already more than two hours long, I suppose it might be a bit much to show us everything.

By the end I was more inclined to believe it was all a dream or some kind of coping mechanism for loss as the closing scenes simply left more questions than answers.Acting is peak but appearances are muddled by the often confusing mental stability of the main character and random introductions of characters that in the end played no real role in the storyline.",

In a film that concerns his character avenging the murder of his wife (played by Rachel Brosnahan in a very small, too small role) we should feel a good deal of compassion for him. I didn't. And neither will you. How can you feel compassion for a piece of wood. Believe me, you can't.Incredibly there is a problem even bigger than Malek.You see his character is a CIA Puzzle Solver. He's smart, real smart. And whenever he's in a jam, something happens - an explosion, a car crash, a navigation error - that miraculously gets him out of that jam. We are supposed to believe that somehow he planned and executed his escape; he planned the explosion, etc. But how? And when? And with what materials? Because the film does not spend ewven one second on his doing anything of that nature. It all happens off-screen.Really folks, this is awful stuff. But I've already wasted too much of your time.

That was a nice breath of fresh air for the film to make it feel slightly unique. Unfortunately that is where the uniqueness of the film stops as everything else is pretty by the numbers. The plot doesn't really have any twist so the story is what it is. The kills are fun although if you saw the trailer you saw the best ones. Rami Malek does the best with what is written for him.

I did have to really suspend my disbelief a lot to allow the film to move forward though. Double booked AirBnB, no hotel rooms available, the main charcater had done no research on the area before arriving. Really?The second act started well and was enhanced because of the events of the first. It works because it sets the audience up in a position where we have more knowledge than the newly introduced characters. It added tension and I was interested in what direction they would take the story.I liked the way the first two acts played with the personalities / backgrounds of the male leads. Hinting and leaning into social stereotypes but leaving a few clues to the real intentions. It works quite well. I may be crediting the writers too much here, but I think I get the underlying message of this film, but it just gets lost by the end.The longer the film goes on (and it does feel a bit overlong), the more ridiculous it gets. It feels like it's written by two different people; or they spent so much time on the first half of the movie they had to rush the rest. There are some truly stupid moments that are almost farcical comedy. All the tension drained out of the film, and it just became a series of ridiculous scenes strung together. Events are telegraphed way ahead of time. All the nuance is gone.It's so disappointing that something so creepy and initially interesting can go so wrong. Ignoring the stupid decisions made by the main charcater in the first act, I would have scored it a 7. The acting is good, the direction is solid, but the story just drags it down so much that by the end I can only give it a 4.",

            "review": "\"Barbarian\" is nerve-racking - from the opening seconds, not minutes, but seconds of the film, director Zach Cregger immediately immerses viewers in an experience that leaves knuckles white, nails bitten, and minds consistently wondering what on God's green earth could possibly happen next.Viewing \"Barbarian\" without any knowledge of what it is about is the optimal viewing experience; however, even if you've seen the trailer for this film, you'll be happy to know that it spoils basically zero of the twists and turns this movie has to offer. Thus, I do not want to spoil anything either, which makes this an incredibly hard review to write! So, what I will do is attempt to explain the basic premise of \"Barbarian,\" and what makes it one of the most thrilling theatre experiences I've had in a long time.Starring the beautiful Georgina Campbell as a lone Airbnb renter who is staying overnight at a house in Detroit, Michigan, \"Barbarian\" opens with Georgina's character, Tess, arriving at her rental to find that another man - played by Bill Skarsgård - is already occupying the home. Claiming that this incident is the result of a simple mixup of double booking, Bill's character Keith invites Tess in to stay the night, promising that, in the morning, they will both get this situation sorted out. From that point on, the movie becomes a razor sharp thriller that will infect audiences with its inherent uneasiness.Is Keith truly a stranger caught up in an innocent mistake, or is he someone, or something, more nefarious? And is the rental property all it seems to be, or is there a greater mystery to be uncovered beneath its welcoming surface? \"Barbarian\" begins by introducing question after question to its audience, ensuring that viewers remain on the edge of their seat trying to predict what will next occur. Second after second and minute after minute, this movie is full of surprises, to the point where, after the 45 minute mark, my expectations were blown out of the water to the point where it felt useless trying to guess what would happen next, because I hadn't the slightest idea what could possibly happen next. And that is the highest compliment I can give this movie because, regardless of how you choose to describe this movie, you cannot claim it to be predictable. And on a side note, the fact that the characters actually made intelligent decisions and thought things out only made the viewing experience more tense, because, since everyone was already doing what I assumed a smart person would do, I had no idea how the scenes and sequences would progress. And I also want to pay my compliments to the soundtrack, the direction, and the cinematography, all of which combined perfectly to create a truly chilling experience.I feel like this is a vague and poorly written review, but only because I do not want to spoil anything for anyone. You may have seen the teasers claiming that this film is so scary that people are screaming, vomiting, and passing out in the theatre - while that is just false marketing at its finest, I will say that \"Barbarian\" did induce a physical reaction from me at parts - I could feel my heart practically beating out of my chest during certain sequences due to the suspense. So, while I don't necessarily find this film to be scary, it is one of the most adrenaline pumping experiences I have had in a long, long time. If you are at all a fan of thrillers, I'd recommend seeing this on the biggest screen you can find, and preferably late at night. This isn't the most horrifying movie you'll ever see, but it is sure to get your blood pumping.",

It's a masterfully directed film; Creggor always shows us just enough in each shot that we're left wondering about what's lurking in the empty space on the frame.The first two-thirds of the film are tense when it's quiet and shocking when it's loud. It kept me on my toes for nearly the entire time, which is refreshing for my desensitised eyes.Efficient work is made of the character introductions. Cregor's script doesn't waste time at the beginning of each character's story. We get to know exactly what we need to know about each of them as a person before they get thrust into the metaphorical depths of hell. It makes the eventual carnage all the more nerve-shredding because no character is disposable.So, yes, the film is good. But it's not all good.The film's narrative and pacing are not nearly as compelling and tight, respectively, as they should be due to the fact that it tells the stories of three separate sets of characters (one after the other) before getting to the finale.Also, the film's last act really took a dive into campy and I found it to be a betrayal of the rest of the story's bleak tone.The final set piece is so out-of-left-field and ridiculous that it became unintentionally hilarious for me.This may seem like a minor complaint, but when the ending of the movie leaves a bad taste in my mouth, it kind of sours the whole experience.I wanted this to be better than it was. But it's still so tense throughout its majority and the many twists are so satisfying that I do heartily recommend this subversive horror flick.",

However, when it came out and was getting praised by critics, including Youtube personalities I follow, I became quite interested. Plus, the film has some notable actors like Justin Long and Bill Skarsgard, whom I've liked it other things. After finally seeing the film, I have to say I'm disappointed. Now, this might be because of how hyped-up the film is. Maybe, after seeing it more times I'll warm up to it more. That's happened before. However, right now I can say I wasn't a big fan of the film.It's not the worst or the most disappointing movie I've seen this year. Dr. Strange 2 was definitely the film I was disappointed most by. Halloween Ends is the worst film I saw this year. It's definitely the worst horror film I've seen. I can say Barbarian is better than that film. However, there are other horror movies I've seen that are better like the Black Phone and even the new Hellraiser film.Now, the film does have some things going for it.It's a good-looking movie. It has some creative and atmospheric environments and shots. The performances were all good. There are some good kill scenes. There isn't many of them, but when they happen you have some good effects. I also like how the film subverts expectations a little bit. It feels a little like Psycho in that regard. You think it's going to be one movie, but then it becomes something else later.But I just found the film very boring throughout most of it's run. A slow burn like this can work if you're attached to the characters, but I just wasn't. I found the leads pretty boring or unlikable. So those things really brought the film down for me.But I'm in the minority on that. Most people seem to really like this film, and that's fine. Right now, I'm not really one of them. If you want a horror movie that cleverly subverts your expectations, but is more fun (at least to me), watch Malignant by James Wan.",

The direction is flat, slow and didn't bring any real tension as I have seen way scarier dark tunnel horror scenes.Characters were introduced in a banal way like a tv show pilot with many scenes to give them back story that had nothing to do with the main plot. I guess their main trait is that they all behave very irrationally inside that house.Then the flashback just presented what we sort of guessed all along and in a way that was neither frightening or interesting. After such a long build up I was expecting a proper twist or at least at true horror moment. The \"action\" at the end felt rushed, goofy and again not scary at all.I'm a horror film lover and that's probably the issue as I have seen this exact sort of stories done better. Also this year didn't disappoint with many gems by very accomplished directors like The Black Phone, Pearl, X, Nope (although I'll admit Nope barely fits the horror category).

I DETEST spoilers (unless I specifically ask for them) and those who think they actually gain something by revealing anything more than what is necessary.

And the title of the fourth film in the series, 'The Final Destination', implied it would be the final instalment of the series back in 2009, however anyone familiar with modern Hollywood probably knew that was unlikely to remain the case - and it lasted 2 years.When you make an instalment 14 years after the last, there's probably a sense that you have to do something a little different in order to justify it. And this film does mix the formula up - slightly. Just enough that it feels a little different, but not enough that it really alters the formula we have come to know and love.The opening scene in this movie was really good. It was lengthy, fairly creative and had some great individual kills in the mix. From there thing go into a lull for a while, allowing the story to set itself up. Then the film goes bananas the rest of the way and we are treated to brilliant kill scene after brilliant kill scene. There are some really good ones in this film.One thing that was a problem here - and something that has plagued the series in almost every film - is that it is riddled with unlikable characters. I can only think that's being done intentionally at this point to make people feel disposable and like no one is safe, but I can't help but feel the films would be slightly more impactful if the characters were a bit more likable overall.All in all though I would say 'Final Destination: Bloodlines' was a lot better than it had any right to be 25 years after the original. 8/10.",

            "review": "It's wild to say this, but after five movies and more than two decades, Final Destination somehow still has life left in it. Or rather, death. And this time, it hits a little closer to home. Bloodlines isn't just about unlucky strangers cheating fate anymore but it's about family. And with that shift, the stakes suddenly feel heavier, the emotions more raw. Because when death comes for the blood, it's not just fear you feel. It's grief. It's guilt. It's love. And maybe that's why this entry stands out, for better or worse.Let's start with the concept. Family has never been the center of this franchise. We've seen classmates, co-workers, and acquaintances on the run from death, but this time, we're watching people who genuinely care for each other fall into that cycle. That makes a huge difference. It hurts more. It hits deeper. And yeah, it makes us wonder, if it were your family, how far would you go to stop the inevitable?Also, credit where it's due. The film tries something new with the opening accident. No highways, no planes, no race tracks or suspension bridges. This time, it all kicks off in a high-rise restaurant. That shift alone already breathes new life into the formula. It's unexpected. It's acrophobic. It's oddly elegant and terrifying at the same time. But don't get too excited, if you were hoping for the long-awaited ship or water-related disaster (like many of us were), this ain't it.Now, let's talk about the gore. We know why you're here. And yes, the deaths are brutal. Bloody. Wild. There were moments we flinched, moments we squirmed, moments we covered our eyes and peeked through our fingers. But as great as some of those sequences were, they don't quite reach the unforgettable horror of FD 2 or 3. Why? Because it uses too much CGI. The deaths feel animated and not in a good way. There's something about practical effects that stick with you, that disturb you long after the credits roll. Bloodlines often trades that realism for spectacle, and in doing so, it loses a bit of its bite.The suspense is honestly a hit or miss. Part of what made Final Destination so scary was how simple the deaths were. The log truck that caused generational trauma, the tanning bed that was caused by dripping water, the escalator that was merely simple but very traumatizing, the lasik eye surgery that could happen basically to anyone. They made you fear your own bathroom. But here, some of the deaths feel too 'engineered'. Like fate had to go through a hundred different steps and a sprinkle of miracles just to make them happen. That makes it less scary, less grounded. It becomes a \"movie death,\" not a \"this could happen to me\" death.And that brings us to tone. This one's tricky. Bloodlines has this weird, goofy energy that feels like it wandered in from another genre. While we have cloudy sombre mood in Final Destination 2 or gothic rock look in Final Destination 3, this one felt goofy overall. It's still horror, yes, but it sometimes flirts a little too hard with comedy and not in the smart, dark humor way. Some of the jokes land, but a few feel way out of place. Like they belong in a Nickelodeon teen movie, not a franchise built on dread and doom. It felt comical and fantasy-like. You can definitely feel the directors' Disney Channel DNA in there especially in how some of the dialogue is written and delivered (Remember, they directed the live-action Kim Possible Movie fore real). A few lines honestly made us laugh, not because they were funny, but because they felt awkwardly placed or just plain corny.But even with the tonal whiplash, the movie does do a few things really well. The balance between drama and horror is actually quite solid in some scenes. There are moments where you do care about the characters, their grief, their confusion, their desperation. There's one particular scene involving a sibling that really tugged at the heart. And those are the moments where Bloodlines reminds us what this franchise can be when it isn't trying to be too clever or too loud.There are also some nice throwbacks for longtime fans but it's blink-and-you'll-miss-it easter eggs like a passing log truck, a familiar hospital name (Clear River, anyone?), and references to past characters or deaths. It's fan service, sure, but in a sweet, subtle way. Not overbearing. Just enough to make you smile but in fear.Unfortunately, the pacing could've been tighter. The first half is a slow burn, and if you came in expecting death after death like Final Destination 2 or 4, you might be let down. This feels more like the first film. The story drives the engine, and the deaths are pit stops along the way. The final climax was mid. It doesn't really feel like that was supposed to be the climax of the movie. They could have explored more on how they could have impacted the story or the deaths more but what we got was a mid climax that felt boring and meh. It just doesn't build up to that edge-of-your-seat tension we were hoping for. It fizzles, rather than explodes.We need to be honest about the visuals. Some of the camera work, lighting choices and delivery of dialogues just feel... off. Almost like you're watching an 18+ TV show rather than a polished horror film. At times it looks cheap, which is disappointing because this series deserves to feel cinematic. The horror deserves weight. Gravity. Darkness. Instead, it occasionally feels like a high-budget student film with B to C-list actors.Still, despite all of that, we can't lie. We had fun. It gave us chills. It made us look over our shoulder. And more than anything, it reminded us that the Final Destination series still knows how to make death feel terrifyingly inevitable.Verdict: After five films and a long break, Final Destination: Bloodlines doesn't just bring the franchise back - it rewires it. It's flawed, yes. The CGI bleeds into the kills too much. The goofy tone doesn't always match the stakes. But it hits deep. This isn't just about death anymore. It's about love, guilt, and what it means to lose someone you'd die for. Sure, some deaths feel too engineered, and yes, the tone sometimes slips into Nickelodeon-territory, but there's a real beating heart underneath the chaos. The CGI may cheapen the gore, but it still made us squirm, look away, and nervously laugh all in the same breath. It's not the scariest entry but it might be the most 'human'. And for a series known for senseless carnage, that's a wild achievement.",

            "review": "This sixth franchise installment keeps the same core concept as the previous films but takes a fresh approach to the story. This time, the accidents aren't shown through the typical dynamics of the characters, but focus on tragedies from the past of the main character's grandmother. The film doesn't just involve friends and loved ones, but also family, making the narrative much darker and more morbid.The deaths are far more creative, and while the accidents themselves aren't typical for a horror movie, they're events you could imagine happening in everyday life. Still, these occurrences are something we haven't seen in the series before, making the film all the more unpredictable.It's been 14 years since the last installment, and I'm glad the creators decided to bring Final Destination back. I think they nailed the essence of the story, and the film is just as good as the previous ones, if not better than some. The effects are incredible, the CGI is top-notch, and we've been lacking a high-quality horror film like this, especially in the last few years.I have to mention that the film disgusted and shocked me more than the previous ones, which means they nailed the effects. This film not only satisfies fans of the franchise but also brings something new and revitalizes the series.",

It does the smart thing and goes for a more comedic approach than earlier entries in the series.Bloodlines contains possibly the best opening of the franchise and the first 20 minutes are a treat. The effects, while not amazing, do the job and are particularly gory even for this series.The movie works well bringing a new twist on the Final Destination formula and the family are all likable enough in their own ways.It would be remiss of me not to mention a standout in Richard Harmon. I spend a good portion of his time on screen trying to calculate if Tom Green could have fathered him as he is his dead ringer in this (amazingly both canadian as well). It was obvious they were going for a Tom Green type of character.Tony Todd shows up for the last time as the mortician and it's a great emotional and poetic send off for him as well as giving his character an interesting backstory.The movie has some nice little easter eggs for fans of the series with some call backs to previous entries as well as harking back to some of the premonitions.The Final Destination franchise has always been interesting to me but never quite delivered a quality movie. This is perhaps the closest it has came to that by just being a good time and not getting bogged down in the lore.",

Bloodlines is a solid sixth installment, packing the same patented \"inevitable death\" mechanics we know and (occasionally) love, but with enough fresh twists to keep die-hard fans from checking out.If you never warmed to the idea of \"death's design\" calling the shots, this won't convert you. For everyone else, the film delivers brilliantly choreographed set pieces of grisly demise-think elaborate Rube Goldberg traps drenched in splatter FX-that hit the sweet spot between macabre creativity and good old-fashioned gore.The biggest upgrade this time around is emotional buy-in: the victims aren't a bunch of arbitrary strangers thrown together by fate. Instead, Bloodlines builds sincere rapport with its core ensemble, giving each death a bit more narrative weight (and, yes, a smidge of pathos) before the inevitable payoff.Unfortunately, the dialogue remains as thin as ever-flat exposition one moment, telenovela melodrama the next-reminding you that subtlety wasn't high on the call sheet.On the plus side, the movie leavens the carnage with genuinely funny, ironically staged moments-many courtesy of Erik, whose over-the-top flair steals scenes from our so-called protagonist-and the delightfully absurd chain reactions (who knew the garbage truck could be such a menace?).Even though the film trudges into its predictable finale with all the subtlety of a wrecking ball, Bloodlines is pure adrenaline: brutal, energetic, and darkly comedic. In other words, exactly what you paid for when you bought that Final Destination ticket.",

However that was the peak of the movie and its never really able to reach those same highs. The first movies best feature was the tension created before a death, think Todd's death.This movie mostly falls flat with this, instead trading mention for humour. Watching the first film with the exact same crowd, no one laughed at any deaths, it was serious and tense, bloodlines focused way too much on making the atmosphere light-hearted that it felt like a horror comedy on the level of cocaine bear.What this film does do better is the gore, the deaths feel a lot more impactful visually, without going into details, a lot of them make you cringe out of sympathy. My last gripe is the scene in tattoo parlour shown on the bloodlines teaser trailer, it pretty much was only included so that they could put it in trailers and promotional material.",

This one has the same premise as the others only it concentrates on a family this time around rather than a group who all avoid a deadly disaster. The main set up at the start was well done (some dodgy CGI but that's fine) and will unlock another new fear in you. Some of the deaths scenes are brutal but being a horror fan I'm never bothered by the red stuff on screen and particularly one scene set in a hospital.

Three main problems in this one:It's very ugly, whether it's the special effects of the death scene (it's equivalent to the 4th, just meh), or even the staging and overall directing. I mean, even the atmosphere was bland (at least the 5th was gloomy, with the overcast weather throughout and the grey colors...).Humor. Why? Not everything is Scream. I accept cynical humor in DF but it is usually subtle (like the two coffins in DF3, the \"I got my eye on you\" scene etc...), but here it's always present, so much so that it just takes out the tension completely, and makes every death scene just dull. Even for the best death scene of the movie they couldn't resist the urge of adding some humor. I felt 0 tension throughout the movie, and that's not ok for a DF movie.The family choice. I understand that strangers who barely know each other's are not very moved by the death of one of them, but when it comes to a family, maybe more emotions would make the movie more realistic? You don't crack jokes right after a member of your close family dies...(Also I thought that the buildups were very \"meh\", apart from the barbecue one, and we see it in the trailer...)Overall it's a misfire.

However, as someone who became obsessed with the Final Destination franchise nearly 2 decades ago after watching the choose your own fate edition of Final Destination 3 with the tanning bed scene permanently seared into my brain, I'm a bit more harsh.Cons:The CGI blood and kills. Nothing takes me out of a scene more than dark red cartoon blood. With a film that is built PRIMARILY on deaths it should be quite limited on the usage of CGI. We've seen great use of practical effects which is why this feels like such wasted potential. The biggest reason these movies work is because no matter how ridiculous the set up is the death still feels real (4th sequel excluded). It doesn't have the same effect if the person dying sudden looks like an animated character.This might be the most useless protagonist since the 4th installment. The main character might be the blandest character in the whole movie, and she has some tough competition because only 3 people stand out in this movie. I can forgive throw away characters if the deaths are memorable but both are lacking here.There have been rumors that there were reshoots and I believe them because the final act has some pacing issues and ends somewhat abruptly.Pros:I will say that this film had the 2nd best opening scene/disaster behind the pile up.Tony Todd's goodbye was moving and possibly the best dialogue he has given in the franchise.The hospital death scene involving an MRI machine has a great build up of suspense and emotion and is up there with other iconic final destination death scenes.While there is more cons then pros for me I still had a good time and still fun to see in theaters.

It looked like average slasher movie. There weren't any smart ways they stopped someone from dying so that they die after they stopped it, there wasn't anything else later that would be special about the movie. There weren't any quotes, there was luck symbolism with coin and how it was used \"to get them\" and they lost the coin so \"like a lucky coin\" and old woman found it and lost it. There was some exploration of luck and fate then but as we could have seen, it was superficial. Also the ending was very dumb for me, yeah they couldn't cheat death and so but... I wish there was bit more depth to the story, bit more exploration of some themes like luck, life, death, fate.

I couldn't picture another actor in his role. I also like the supporting cast members, like Anil Kapoor, NTR, Kiara, and others. The action scenes are, in many cases, well-done. The best scene is the opening scene involving a samurai sword fight; it kinda reminded me of a clip from the John Wick franchise. The airplane scene later on is also thrilling . I'm not usually a fan of the songs in Bollywood movies, but I like the one with Hrithik and NTRNo spoilers - but the movie uses some flashbacks to flesh out Hrithik and NTR's characters. The young actors who play the younger version of their characters look the part. The casting was well done here.The movie has the following issues: though I like the action scenes most of the time, I didn't like the music blaring in the background. The slow motion works most of the time, but on a few occasions, the effect is cheesy. Some of the characters perform feats that push the movie into Marvel / DC comic book territory; it's as if Hrithik and NTR both had doses of super-soldier serum. Some parts are almost comedy. In the finale, we get a fight scene that occurs in a place that looks like Superman's fortress. In another scene, Hrithik and one of the supporting cast members are getting shot at by many henchman in a parking lot, yet they're able to stand behind a pillar and talk like they're in a cafeThe romance between Hrithik and Kiara wasn't right. They make clear that her father was like a father to Hrithik since Hrithik was a boy. I feel that their relationship should've been more like siblings than husband/wife.

While the movie is a feast for the eyes and focuses heavily on cinematic grandeur, it struggles significantly with its narrative, losing its grip on the plot and lacking an engaging screenplay.The film's visual spectacle is its primary focus. The action sequences are undoubtedly impressive in scale, and the production design is lavish. However, this dedication to grandeur seems to come at the expense of a well-developed and compelling story. The plot feels disjointed, and the screenplay lacks the emotional depth needed to make the high stakes truly resonate with the audience.The movie's lack of a strong emotional core is particularly noticeable in the background story.The characters' motivations and backstories are not explored with enough depth, making it difficult to form a genuine connection with them. As a result, the film becomes a series of impressive set pieces without a solid foundation to hold them together.While the action may be a good distraction, the lack of narrative engagement and emotional depth makes \"War 2\" a less satisfying experience than the first film. It's a visually appealing movie, but one that leaves you feeling unfulfilled.",

            "review": "Just came out from the First show of War 2 in the US and was overall entertained. It is a good action packed movie but does go a bit over the top for me. The highlights of the movie are its very well executed action set pieces with good stunt work and VFX. The story arcs for the characters of Colonel Luthra, Kabir and Vikram are well written. NTR Jr's role has some pretty interesting twists and turns while Kiara not only looks stunning but also packs a real punch. The couple of new characters introduced into the Spy Universe are also pretty Jhakaas and Alpha.The main attraction of the movie is of course Hrithik. He looks gritty, real (his age) and absolutely fantastic which is probably the reason my wife loved the movie. His high octane entry scene, his thrilling action sequences, his stylish dance moves, his trademark trembling face of anger and his teary eyed monologue are all present in the movie. Hrithik carries the movie but NTR Jr's fans will not be disappointed when he makes his entry, delivers some chill action sequences, shakes a fancy leg, reveals an interesting origin story and has an over the top but cool finale.The movie is long but is pretty quick moving from one action packed set piece to another. However in order to enjoy the movie, one has to be fine with Kabir's Alpha wolf dominates a real fierce wolf just with his sheer presence and looks, takes on an army of Katana wielding Ninjas, drives a car in the most unexpected places, performs some mind boggling stunts on boats, planes and trains, dodges and even survives some really lethal bullets. The songs are good but not at the same level as the original war. The mid-credit scene introducing the next chapter of the Spy Universe is pretty nice, especially the unexpected cameo. The mention of Pathaan and Tiger is cool but underwhelming because of their complete absence from the movie.On the YRF Spy Universe scale War 2 lands somewhere between War and Pathaan. It doesn't rise up to the level of Ek Tha Tiger and Tiger Zinda Hai but also doesn't take a dive to the Tiger 3 level. Its a fun entertaining watch for the action sequences, Hrithik and Spy Universe fans but dont expect a lot of heart and goosebumps. 7.5/10.",

            "review": "Spike Lee and Denzel Washington don't miss a beat in Lee's new film Highest 2 Lowest, taking Kurosawa's original film of the same name and running it straight up into Noo Yawk City. With this film, which keeps the action flowing from start to finish, Lee is unabashedly unreserved about his adoration for the greatest city in the world. In ways both overt and subtle, Lee transports the audience into 'Spike's World', weaving his personal preferences in art, music and, of course, his loyalty to the NY Yankees, with engrossing, non-stop action and a dash of humor.This is 1000% Lee's love song to New York City. From the dazzling beauty of the NYC skyline to the grit of a Bronx tenement, Lee puts his vision on the screen. Matthew Libatique, Lee's Director of Photography, gives us a melange of visual qualities within the film. From top-of-the-line digital to the graininess of 8MM, again, highest to lowest, the artistry here is unmistakeable. Highest 2 Lowest's basic premise, the kidnapping of a wealthy man's son, is Mr. Lee's fifth collaboration with Mr. Washington, and it hits every note perfectly.Paintings and portraits from Spike's personal collection, including Kehinde Wiley's 'Investiture of Bishop Harold as the Duke of Franconia', the depiction of a black man wearing a Brooklyn Dodger's number 42 jersey, Jackie Robinson's number, find pride of place on the walls of music mogul David King's (Denzel Washington) multi-million dollar DUMBO duplex. DUMBO, in case you're wondering, is Down Under The Manhattan Bridge Overpass, and is currently the most affluent part of Brooklyn. You can take Spike out of Brooklyn, but you'll never take Brooklyn out of Spike. The two are forever intertwined in Lee's filmography.Other works by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Patrick Martinez, Radcliff Bailey, even a Brooklyn Dodger's scoreboard, pieces that have been exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum, some of which are certainly from Lee's own home, decorate the office and home of King, his wife Pam (Ilfenesh Hadera) and their son Trey (Aubrey Joseph).King is in the middle of refinancing a multi-million dollar deal for his record company, Stackin' Hits. Pam is on the Board of various high-end charities that promote emerging Black artists. Trey believes himself to be an up and coming talent scout. Soon after dropping Trey off for summer basketball camp at LIU's downtown Brooklyn campus, and after successfully negotiating his business deal, King returns home in his Rolls Royce, chauffered by his oldest friend, Paul Christopher (Jeffrey Wright). Paul served time in prison, but King, believing strongly in second chances, which is a major theme in the film, has employed Christopher since his release. King is also godfather to Paul's son, Kyle (Elijah Wright). Kyle and Trey are as close as blood brothers, attending the LIU basketball camp together.After arriving home, King receives a phonecall from a man telling him that his son, Kyle, has been kidnapped, and the 'king's ransom' is $17.5 million. The plot quickly thickens when we learn that godson Kyle is also missing and in great danger. King and some NYPD detectives attempt to follow their leads, taking us for a ride on the NYC subway systems Number 4 and 6 trains.From the exuberance of cheering fans en route to a game at Yankee Stadium, through a Puerto Rican Day Festival featuring Brooklyn natives Rosie Perez, Anthony Ramos (yes, that's a holy crap moment right there) and Latin music legend, pianist, bandleader and Grammy winner Eddie Palmieri, the film is a celebration of the chaos, energy and diversity that make up this amazing city and all its boroughs. On a side note, Palmieri, a Harlem native, passed away just last week at the age of 88.Lee even takes a moment to pay homage to A24, the distributor of Highest 2 Lowest. Lee and the crew must have had a blast making this film. As you watch Denzel seamlessly switch vernaculars from business mogul to street slang, depending on his audience and what he's trying to accomplish, you know you're watching a master at work. So many Kings brought to you in the county of Kings, from a man who is still a King of cinema.",

It seemed like it was written by a 13 year old. Some very bad acting...almost walked out early on but was hoping for a payoff that never really comes. Out of the whole 2+ hours there was maybe like 5 minutes of what I would call good or interesting choices. It's so over the top and cheesy, including most of the music that is getting undeserved praise. A lot of times it doesn't fit with what's happening on the screen much at all.

After watching the original movie High and Low by Akira Kurosawa I was intrigued to check out this remake by Spike Lee but gotta say I'm very disappointed in how far this movie falls short of Kurosawa's classic. In all honesty I don't believe Spike was the right person to even direct such a remake and instead I believe this movie should've been directed by someone like Scorsese who would've made the film the action thriller it should've been instead of this confusing mess that Spike Lee made. I'll rate this movie a 5 out of 10 due to the simple fact that the script is horrible despite Denzel Washington and Jeffery Wright carrying the movie, everyone else seemed like rookie actors who made the movie feel like a made for BET or Lifetime movie. I also have no idea why this movie went over 2 hours, lol I felt compelled to walk out the theater from being so underwhelmed for how cringeworthy the last 10 - 20 minutes of this movie became. I actually would've been more favorable towards this movie had it been shorter, like probably giving this a 6/10 but it just went on for far too long and quickly became a trainwreck to watch, it seemed as if Spike didn't even know how he wanted to end the movie so instead he prolonged it with unnecessary scenes.

This movie offered none of those. The focus work was sloppy, the scenes noisy, and the color grading looked as if five different studios took turns without any agreed theme. At times, it genuinely looked like it was shot on a potato. The opening scene, with a car's headlights mimicking an anamorphic lens flare, looked more like a fifth grader shining a flashlight into the camera than a deliberate artistic choice.While I admire and respect black excellence, the over-the-top delivery here felt forced and stripped the film of authenticity. When you need an actress to verbally explain to the audience why a character picked a certain currency based on its weight in a backpack, it's proof the script and storyline had no real substance. The result was a narrative that forced the audience through mental hoops that were either frustrating or sleep-inducing.Quite frankly, this felt less like a polished Denzel project and more like a neighborhood amateur film, obsessed with delivering a single message rather than creating true art. I've seen better, tighter productions from film students working on a fraction of the budget.In the end, this wasn't just a disappointing movie-it was an exhausting, agonizing experience. Not only do I want my $40 back, but I'd also like the three hours I wasted trying to convince myself it would somehow get better. My recommendation: avoid this!",

A remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1963; thriller \"High To Low\" (and Denzel's second Kurosawa adaptation if you count his role in \"The Magnificent Seven,\" a remake of a remake of \"The Seven Samurai\"), Lee allows Washington to strut as a Manhattan music mogul in a way that reminds one of his Frank Lucas in \"American Gangster\" until the son of his chauffeur (the superbly underplaying and great patter partner Jeffrey Wright) is kidnapped by a desperate ransomer (a briefly-on-break from impregnating Rhianna A$AP ROCKY). Washington and Lee having spent so much of their professional lives together just move in perfect sync together as Lee shoots in a quick urban groove, with echoes of his love letters to New York in \"Girl 6,\" \"He Got Game\" and \"25th Hour.\" Denzel of course as one of the greatest actors alive can move from proud to pleading in the blink of an eye, and Lee's masterful cinematic vocabulary carries him through every beat perfectly. With able support from great newcomers Ilfenesh Hadera and Elijah Wright, one hopes this doesn't mark the last time these two team-up; they just wake up an almost hopelessly corporate cinema like no one else.",

At the same time, he has made some pretty awful movies, particular Oldboy (2013) and Miracle at St. Anna. With his latest film, based on a reinterpretation of Akira Kurosawa's classic \"High and Low\", it falls quite flat and rough.For starters, there are some nice camerawork that helps presents the atmosphere and environment. Creating the vibe and energy of the city of New York. Lee does offer some fresh themes and concepts about it's characters, writing, and the political aspects, however it all feels confused, misplaced, and messy. The writing feels as if this new reinterpretation didn't offer anything special or interesting to the original and book, as if Lee confuses with what he wants to present and display. Alongside with some laughable bad dialogue, the performances are a mix bag. Denzel Washington does provide his best as his energy and personality is good. However some of the other performances are honestly pretty bad, particularly Ilfenesh Hadera. Almost as if the performances are TV levels of acting or being intentionally awful.The production designs and structure feels cheap and dated, almost as if the movie is having a Hallmark and Lifetime approach. The musical score is one of the worst aspects about this movie as it's presentation, sounding, and how the music is used is all over the place, messy, and atrocious. Regarding pacing, it drags, as the pacing remains uneven and it's first and second act really struggles. However, around it's third act, it does pick up with some interesting and good thrilling moments.I'm honestly kind of surprised with the positive reviews because audiences and critics have been raving this reinterpretation, however I found it to be tedious and frustrating. I do appreciate it isn't as disgraceful as Lee's remake of \"Oldboy\" (which I'm glad to hear he has since disowned the movie). However, no matter what, it's pretty clear that it's best to stay away from remaking classics because it ain't worth it.",

And he seems to stretch out the scenes filled with dialog too long to the point you want to say \"cut\" or edit. And that's what I felt watching this \"Apple Studio\" movie. Spike in an interview said Apple was the only studio that would finance it. It's going straight to stream in about two weeks.The acting is subpar and his close-ups of Denzel pondering decisions are laughable. Most of the actors are TV actors so that explains it the subpar-ness.The movie perks up when the ransom drop takes place, but even then you wonder - WHAT the H? The money bag is passed from moto biker to moto biker and the police lose the actual money bag. From my understanding when there's a kidnapping and ransom of a high-powered executive like David King, the FBI takes the lead. Did Spike NOT do his home work?Denzel is in every scene and that can be a bit too much. I wished to see more of the police work to find the kidnapper, but that falls to Denzel and his chauffeur. Which wouldn't happen in real life. An executive of a record company wouldn't go on the hunt himself. IMO. He would have security do it. Which was also a head-scratcher.

Highest 2 Lowest is one of the best movies of the year and one of the top crime movies of all time.Music mogul David Kin (Denzel Washington) is threatened to be personally and professionally dethroned by the kidnapping of his son, Trey (Aubrey Joseph), by criminals unknown until later. It is revelatory to see the police navigate kidnapping with the social-media challenges that attack the high-profile dad for the way he deals with the demands of the crooks, the public, and morality.Lee has a field day playing the racial tensions between the races, including this time Puerto Rico and Cuba and who knows how many others in the biggest melting pot ion the world. Lee makes the conflicts lyrical with music that inspires community and love.The love letter to New York by cinematographer Matthew Libatique is beautiful as well as complementary to the complex plot and the NY vision usually accompanying a Lee movie. The beautiful landscape belies the ugly proceedings as King is morally challenged by a twist in which he becomes responsible for the ransom of a child not his own. It's a personally and publicly Hobson's choice that Denzel handles with Oscar-nominating dexterity.Oscar-worthy is his face off with the kidnapper. The rapping motif is jaw-droppingly expert and electrifying. Denzel carries it off with the cool mastering that makes him one of the top actors of his generation.In a logical comparison with Michael Douglas's Gordon Gekko of Wall Street, Denzel's King is less impressive if only for the wide range Douglas's script gives, yet the studio rapper scene in Higher is a tour de force for Denzel.

A mature, layered, emotionally chaotic ride through what love, regret, and timing really mean in today's world.Anurag Basu is in full control here. The way he juggles multiple stories, characters, moods-it's effortless. The man just gets human complexity. No melodrama, no preachy nonsense-just real people, real pain, and beautifully messy connections.Konkona Sen Sharma & Pankaj Tripathi are just masterclasses on screen. Quiet brilliance. The rest of the cast also do a brilliant job except for Sara. She for the life of her just cannot act.Pritam's music is soul touching, haunting, and so well placed that it hurts. It might be one of his most important works. Every note blends effortlessly with the screenplay.This film isn't trying to impress. It's just honest-and that's what makes it hit. Relationships are messy, people are flawed, and life doesn't always come with closure.",

You do not even realise when twenty minutes have flown by. Everyone in the cast does well, though Ali and Fatima come across as slightly stiff in emotionally charged scenes. Adi is effortless and charismatic, and Sara pairs well with him. Neena Gupta and Anupam Kher remind you of their experience with ease. Pankaj and Konkona are the real standouts, with Pankaj bringing sharp comic timing through his subtle expressions and improvised bits. Pritam's music is wonderfully woven into the narrative. The songs do not just support the story, they carry its soul.The first half is tight and keeps you thoroughly engaged.It is the second half where the film loses some grip. The storylines begin to feel stretched, and the endings are not clearly defined. A few subplots could have been skipped to bring in more clarity and depth. That said, the camerawork and visual setups in some scenes are beautiful and worth appreciating. The film explores themes of infidelity and emotional detachment, and it leaves you with a feeling that this is the generalisation the film wants you to settle with. The resolution feels rushed and a bit too convenient. In the end, Metro In Dino remains a musically rich experience with a gripping first half, but the latter part misses the same emotional weight and leaves you wishing for a more satisfying conclusion.OVERALL 7.5/10.",

Most of the positive reviews online don't seem real-they look fake or overly promoted.Sara Ali Khan still needs to improve her acting. Her performance doesn't connect. On the other hand, Ali Fazal, Anupam Kher, Konana , Aditya and Neena Gupta acted really well and gave strong performances. They were the only good part of the film.Instead of focusing on a proper story, the movie feels like a Pritam music album. Nearly half the movie is just him singing. It's like they forgot they were making a film and just turned it into a concert.This movie doesn't even come close-maybe not even 5%-to what Life in a... Metro was. That 2007 film was a masterpiece with great storytelling, strong emotions, and music that added meaning. I don't understand how they could ruin something that had so much potential.The direction is very poor and confusing. There's no clear flow or depth in the scenes. Every second scene shows Pritam singing on a terrace or walking down a street with a guitar. It feels unnecessary and forced. The audience in the theatre even started laughing when he showed up again and again-it became silly after a point.Music should support a movie, not take over the entire thing. They had the chance to make something meaningful, but they completely wasted it. This was a major disappointmentThree star only for Ali , Neena , Anupam, Aditya , Konona.",

Metro, but falls just short.Anurag Basu, known for his heartfelt, layered storytelling in films like Life in a... Metro, Gangster, Barfi!, and Ludo, returns with Metro... In Dino - a film that attempts to revisit the emotional and interconnected lives of people in a bustling city like Mumbai. While it brings some strong moments and thoughtful themes, it doesn't quite achieve the narrative tightness or emotional resonance of its 2007 predecessor.Plot Summary (No Major Spoilers):\nThe film follows four parallel stories, each centered around love, loss, and rediscovery:Akash & Shruti - A married couple on the brink of parenthood, struggling with financial issues and career setbacks. The stress convinces them to consider abortion, raising deep moral and emotional questions.Parth & Chumki - Chumki, a corporate employee engaged to someone she's unsure about, meets Parth. Their relationship blooms amidst complications, offering a glimpse into modern love and hesitation.Kajol & Monty - A married couple with a teenage daughter, facing emotional decay as Monty turns to dating apps in search of excitement. Kajol's quiet hurt is among the more affecting aspects of the film.Shibani & Parimal - Shibani, the mother of Chumki and Kajol, is an older woman who finds companionship in Parimal after years of dealing with her husband's betrayal. Their story offers the most gentle and emotionally honest moments in the film.Each story unfolds in its own arc but eventually intersects, mirroring the structure of Life in a... Metro, though without the same emotional impact.What Works:\nPerformances: The cast delivers solid, believable performances, especially the more experienced actors like Neena Gupta (as Shibani) and Anupam Kher (as Parimal). Sara Ali Khan somehow made a very decent comeback as Chumki, and Ali Fazal & Fatima Sana deliver a very nuanced performance.Pankaj Tripathi performs immaculately, but Konkona & Aditya were very flat in their performance and didn't create much impact in the story.Music: Pritam manages to maintain the live band sequence this time with Papon & Raghav Chaitanya, similar to Life in a Metro, and delivers a few emotionally resonant tracks that complement the tone. Zamaana Lage and Dil Ka Kya were the main highlights. But too many songs and the balance between scenes & music ratio was off compared to Life in a Metro.Themes: The film captures relevant emotional and relational issues - urban isolation, generational gaps, infidelity, and the search for meaningful connection, but the 2nd half becomes extremely far-fetched and loses momentum later on, making the end very less tight and out of context.Overall, this is a one-time watch. While it starts off with a good narrative, the second half becomes too stretched with too many songs, and the editing is less crisp. Maybe a tighter ending, this would've been my two cents of advice to Anurag Basu.",

Anurag Basu is a master of seeing people being happy and wholesome in otherwise hopeless situations. That's the soul of his movies.That is not the case in this movie. The movie is filled with things that are totally unlike what Anurag makes. Maybe he had changed a lot of things to fulfil the wishes of the overlords and make this ambitious project happen.

In Dino\" attempts to recreate the grounded emotional mosaic of Anurag Basu's earlier urban anthologies like Life in a... Metro (2007), but this time, the soul seems largely missing. The film juggles multiple short stories set in today's chaotic, restless urban life-but the threads barely connect on a deeper level.What once felt intimate and raw now comes across as safe and polished. Despite a stellar ensemble cast-Aditya Roy Kapur, Sara Ali Khan, Konkona Sen Sharma, Ali Fazal, Fatima Sana Shaikh, and more-the characters often feel like sketches rather than real people. The performances are competent, but the screenplay rarely gives them space to breathe. There are glimpses of warmth and nostalgia, especially in Pritam's music and some of Basu's quieter visual moments, but they're fleeting.Where the original Metro pierced with its emotional sincerity and understated pain, In Dino chooses more decorative storytelling.

Immediately after his release, he steals a phone and a bike, eventually laying his eyes on a house. He finds Velayudham Pillai in the house, who informs him about his Alzheimer. While trying to loot him, Dhayalan notices his account balance at the ATM and plans to rob it all. He accompanies him as Velayudham tries hard to remember his way back home. But all is not what it seems and what secret does Dhayalan uncover about Vedhalam, forms rest of the story.The screenplay starts off as a road movie with Dhayalan and Velayudham, with their meeting too being that of sheer co-incidence. A greedy thief with the ailing old man who seems to be an easy target and both eventually bond during their trip. The film remains slow paced yet the performances keep the show running. The interval twist changes the genre itself as the second half turns into a crime drama involving a vigilante. This is where the director fails to make the smooth transition as it becomes an entirely different film while the slow paced narrative keeps the proceedings mellow. The flaws become glaring with the police reduced to be dummy and the film turns into an ordinary revenge tale. With both the actors flawlessly getting into their respective characters, one wished the writing had supported them in a better way. Definitely a missed opportunity.",

The film positions itself as a different kind of road journey-initially seeming like a cat-and-mouse chase, but eventually shifting into more of a mouse-and-snake(s) survival story.While the concept is intriguing, the execution falls short in several areas. The first half manages to hold some curiosity, but the second half, where serious events play out, feels underwhelming due to weak staging and lack of emotional impact.It's best to approach this film without heavy expectations, since it doesn't try to be an \"ideal\" cinematic experience. If anything, Fahadh's performance stands out as the saving grace in an otherwise uneven ride.Verdict: A different attempt, but only partly effective. Watch it mainly for Fahadh Faasil.",

The bond between the characters was natural, the cinematography and the music was appreciable.While the first half was good, the second half brings a total shift in tone and genre and suddenly it becomes a revenge story.The second half brings the ultimate twist and while it seemed good on paper, the execution was flat and very textbook. A lot of flaws in terms of writing as well as loopholes in the plot, the story was definitely gripping, however the way it was delivered was half cooked - thus ruining the whole setup of the movie.While the second half was marked with flaws, I still feel the movie is a decent watch, although it's not something special worth remembering about.My Rating : 3/5.",

            "review": "I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie.And this is IT!When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are.These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years).Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him \"X\". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet).Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly \"X\", will managed to convince you about that.My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say \"we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick\" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that.This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought.",

            "review": "The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar.Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded.I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves \"behind\" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the \"black hole beyond the horizon\" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, \"all it takes is a little push ! \"*you'll have to see the movie to figure that one out.Félix Tardieu, November 1st, 2014",

            "review": "(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style)There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit.Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar.",

It is a marvelous piece of work whose visuals will be hard to forget. His shots of space and the way he played with colors is rather masterful. Maybe i expected it to be greater than what i saw, but even though i was moved by the movie i did not quite feel like he created something great with 'Interstellar.' This could be attributed maybe to his overuse of sentimentalism in the father-daughter relationship he creates. Nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. I have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies; however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie, given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. Again, the Visuals are completely off the charts. The visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that Nolan has always excelled at. Given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years, Gravity, recently came out, Interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of Visual effects.He will most likely win Visual effects at the Oscars. The Hans's score is marvelous and will most likely earn an Oscar nomination. Matthew Mcconaughey's acting is good, but nothing stellar, especially coming off the best acting role of his career. He plays the character like it should be played, but Nolan's characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.The same can be said for the rest of the cast. The little girl was marvelous though. I do not want to reveal any piece of the story whatsoever, but i have to say, it is one of the most original scripts i've ever seen.Ultimately this movie is entertaining. There is no way Nolan can miss that. Another great thing that Nolan excels at is INSPIRING. By the time the credits rolled and people walked out, I sat there still in awe at the strong sense of human will the movie conveys. Personally, I don't think this is Nolan's best. I believe Memento stands as his masterpiece. But with Nolan, everyone has their own favorite movie. Maybe for some, Interstellar will be their favorite movie, for it is really Nolan's most ambitious and visually-striking work.By the way, Anyone else who even tries to compare Interstellar to \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" is out of their mind. Kubrick's mission was to create art. Nolan in \"Interstellar\" sets to awe and inspire its audiences. It is truly a great piece of work.",

Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen.

            "review": "OK, I'll keep this brief, but I'll also nail my credentials to the mast first. I know science, cosmology, sci-fi and film-making pretty well. I have, in the past taught film studies at degree level, and worked on the production of more than one major Hollywood sci-fi film. I read Stephen Baxter and I like space stuff a lot. More than a lot. And why am I telling you this? Because I should have loved \"Interstellar\", but I didn't for one simple reason: It is a truly dreadful piece of film-making.I won't even bother with dissecting the \"science\" in the film, because that isn't really the issue (it is wrong on pretty much every level). I'm not even going to bother complaining about the absurd audio balance in the sound mix. And I'll ignore the sub-standard special effects - because FX don't a great movie make.The issues I have with Interstellar are essentially these: The film is an arse-numbing three hours long, and feels far longer. The pace is stunningly poorly judged - the first hour in particular could have been cut to ten minutes and far more would have been gained than lost.The characters are paper-thin, and I didn't care about any of them. The plot is entirely derivative (mostly of the vastly superior \"Contact\"). The special effects aren't special at all and the editing (or lack of) is so self-indulgent it is a text book example of a director so enamoured with his project that he loses objectivity. The result is a plodding, flabby, and desperately dull movie devoid of any real excitement or emotional impact.I won't go on, but special mention must be made of the planets - Paddling World and Coldworld. You see virtually nothing of either, and so utterly uninteresting are they that what should have been a moment of genuine cinematic wonderment was squandered with a bit of poor CGI painfully inferior to \"A Perfect Storm\" and a location less dramatic than your own back garden.I've probably not been a brief as I intended, but as I write this I feel the disappointment and actual anger I felt on leaving the cinema bubbling to the surface again. It was a total let-down and a waste of more than three hours of my life. The gushing reviews on here are ridiculous and absurd, and I am forced to conclude that reviewers either watched a different film to me, or saw something so brilliant it completely passed me by. I am fairly confident I didn't doze off, although I desperately wanted to.So in conclusion, \"Contact\" did all of this far, far better, fifteen years ago. In Contact the characters are human, believable, beautifully realised and you care what happens to them. The relationship between Father and Daughter is deeply moving and inspiring. But then the plot is far more sophisticated anyway, dealing with the social tensions and impact of the discovery of extra-terrestrial life, the science is accurate and entirely plausible (it was written by Carl Sagan after all), the movie is genuinely thrilling and full of spectacle, and it has something very profound to say.Contact is everything Interstellar is not, and it has a considerably shorter running time. Contact brought tears to my eyes, Interstellar bored me to tears.",

Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the \"fi\" part of sci-fi. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date.",

            "review": "Just watched Interstellar in imax 70mm. Science Fiction fans can read on, everyone else can skip. Movie is a visual masterpiece. Like his earlier movies, Christopher Nolan once again proved, how big a movie can be! There were some shots,which made audience go crazy..Some scenes were as epic as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Do not go into the theatre expecting an action packed cerebral thriller. This one is not for action fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaughey does what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to all the Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!! Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy. Just like Inception, this movie will be known as great after few months(I know people who said Inception was a crap when it released, and after few months rating it 10/10 in IMDb :D). I don't wanna spoil anything(If you want PM me). Also, make sure you go to the best theatre close to you. (If you loved Donnie Darko, 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is the one for you, Get ready to get mind blown!!) Interstellar Movie is EPIC in all sense!!",

            "review": "Love is the one thing that transcends time and space...New creation of Christopher Nolan's genius, whose name is now known to everyone. His films are waiting with a special look, because it offers something that every day, unfortunately, less and less can be found in the world of mass cinema - an interesting spectacle, filled with meaning, ideas and emotions. At this time, Christopher decided to send us not to the world of dreams, and even not on the dark streets of Gotham City. No, now he send us to the journey to, and perhaps beyond the boundaries of the possible and impossible, through the curvature of space and time, in other worlds. And you won't forget this trip, this can be assured.I was madly waiting for Interstellar's release. And then, finally, I was able to see this Beauty - at the premiere in my coutry on October, 29. It was incredibly exciting. It was a delight. It was unforgettable. It was gorgeous. Nolan once again amazes the viewer's imagination by his painting. Journey to the brink of infinity, the line where humanity has never set, acts as either the first-born purpose and a background of emotional history about the father and the daughter. A loving father who mankind need to help, but that he should leave his children, and a loving daughter who doesn't want to let her dad in the infinity darkness.Starting from the very first frame and ending with the closing credits, a new picture of Nolan will absorb you completely, forcing stare at the screen during the whole action, because it's all so exciting and interesting that escape becomes physically impossible. No, this three hours won't fly quickly for you. You'll feel every emotion, every event, every character. You will not look how the main characters travel through the universe, because the movie experience in this film is so excellent that you will be on board of \"Endurance\" starship and travel between the worlds with the main characters by yourself.The emotional core of this story is the relationship of Matthew McConaughey's character and his daughter - Mackenzie Foy' and Jessica Chastain' character. And the acting work of these three artists in \"Interstellar\" impress the most. McConaughey was acting really great, and this is one of the most emotional, if not the most emotional role of his life. All the drama and tragedy of the relationship of father and daughter in this film will not leave anyone indifferent. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn and other actors also coped with their roles and presented the film's supporting characters very realistic. I would particularly like to note a small but important in this story role of Matt Damon, a character who has received quite memorable. If we talk about the characters, it should be noted also two robots that accompanied our heroes in this difficult journey. One of them adds a touch of humor in the film, which mitigates constantly depressing, dramatic, and sometimes really dark atmosphere.The script of the film is very well combined the history of space exploration and the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The story is complex and complicated, is based on real scientific theories by Kip Thorne, and indeed contains a reference to the \"Space Odyssey\" and other sci-fi pictures. This story about true love, about loyalty, forgiveness, fraud, hard decisions, and much more. And it is designed so that leaves a lot of room for the imagination of the viewer. It's also possible to notice some structure allusion to another Nolan's work - Inception. The story and visuals are combined just perfectly in Interstellar.Hans Zimmer's score, written by him on the basis of only one letter from Nolan, hold the key: \"Once we become parents, we can't help but look at ourselves through the eyes of our children\", deserves a special praise. On this basis, Hans managed to write just incredible soundtrack that perfectly harmonizes with the history and the visual side of the picture. And this work of the composer is really different from the previous ones. It is executed in a different style from another subject in its base. Very impressive work, which will be pleasantly listened again and separate from the film itself.Visual range of the picture is incredibly beautiful and circuses. The \"Endurance\" itself, new worlds, insanely beautiful and mysterious space, wormholes, black holes, and travel through them, folds of time and space are arranged so that is simply breathtaking. I would like to thank all those who contributed to the creation of a visual of this film. It must be seen. That mastery with which this is done, not just words. In the visual pattern also has some references to the Kubrick's \"Odyssey\", and they are pleasing to the eye.Many thanks to Christopher Nolan for having given us such an incredible movie, which once again proved to us that the cinema is Nolan's life.\"Interstellar\" is a film that wins the hearts of the audience not only with its sci-fi splendor, but also an emotional story that lies at its very heart. This film is not only about the discoveries, space exploration and the final frontier of mankind, but also about the relationship of father and daughter, who were in a difficult situation in life when one has to leave the other in the name of a goal that can not be underestimated. So, with what Nolan's genius unfolds before us this action is beyond praise. Combining the story, filled with not only real science fiction, but the true human values ​​and emotions, outstanding and very emotional performances, breathtaking visuals, epic and dramatic soundtrack, Christopher Nolan breathed the life into this film by his directing to create something truly masterpiece again.\"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night... Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light.\"",

            "review": "This year is not very good for the sci-fi cinematography. Besides multiple unintentional parodies of the genre (like X-Men: Days of Future Past), there was actually only one big-budget movie worth watching: On the Edge of Tomorrow. It seems like Tom Cruise is one of the few Hollywood stars able to wisely pick roles. His recent achievements leave little to desire: Valkyrie, or Knight and Day are good at worst, with the high pitch of Oblivion. Are we able to say the same about Matthew McConaughey?Unfortunately, not. Although his recent movies are above average (True Detective or Dallas Buyers Club), the latest picture he plays in, Interstellar (directed by Christopher Nolan and written by him and his brother), is a huge letdown and misunderstanding. I don't think anyone being fond of \"hard\" science-fiction stories will like it. Here is why.Firstly, the story. It is in general similar to Mission to Mars or The Red Planet, where the handful of daredevils are put in the spaceship to venture on a mission, which result will impact the whole human race. Unfortunately, which is the usual problem in this case, the whole plot is neither engaging, nor entertaining. We have a bunch of uninteresting people making uninteresting things in space. Maybe because of the long time span of the picture, the viewer quickly gets bored and does not care about the main characters. Besides, the space adventure is mixed with the very personal story of the father trying to save his children (which is also a time-consuming thread here). Anyway, the main conclusion of Interstellar is the banal statement that \"love is the most important thing in the world\". Do we really need to sit for almost three hours in the cinema to get this?By coincidence, the second problem is the length of the movie. Currently, when the the picture is recorded not on the tape, but in the digital medium, every director tries to surpass his rivals by creating as long movie as possible. Maybe it is supposed to be the emblem of his might, skills or wisdom? I have no idea, but the fact is that the contemporary blockbusters are difficult to watch especially because they last for three or more hours, having the plot for only half of this time. This is exactly the case with Interstellar. The presented story is far from complex, and could easily fit in two hours. In fact, the first forty minutes of the movie have nothing to do with the rest of the story and could be recapitulated by the narrator in two sentences...This film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously. Unfortunately, some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy, while others are just stupid. This mixture makes the suspension of disbelief, necessary to enjoy such movie, impossible to attain. On one side we have wormholes, black holes, higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void. On the other hand, there is totally unconvincing reality of the XXI century, where farmers are more valuable than engineers (guys, really?) and tomography is (mysteriously) gone. In one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole (by the way, this scene is IDENTICAL to the one from the far better Event Horizon). In another, we see the mission robot TARS, being the member of the crew. I know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today (like the one from The Day The Earth Stood Still), but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in Interstellar. It is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture! It's almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of Alien 3...The number of errors and non-logical events is just amazing. Anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in Prometheus (which was also much better than this one) will have the real hunting ground here. In fact, the more time passes after seeing the movie, the more nonsenses are detected. Don't think about this too much, anyway, its not worthy...The Nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story, where the word \"magic\" (interchangeable with \"nonsense\") comes to mind. As the result, the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters... Please recall the infamous Black Hole, and You will have the impression of what is going on here...The music is of course the extremely important part of every picture. If the composer knows his craft, the soundtrack complements the images, creating the flawless combo (as was in Terminator, Starship Troopers, Aliens, etc.). Here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere, but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting, therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise, making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him.Unfortunately, it seems like making a good movie about the interstellar travel is extremely difficult. People like to go to the movies and see a good story. There are multiple requirements for the entertaining movie: the mystery, the convincing scenery, the real characters we could care about, finally, the emotional strain, often related to the dangers our protagonists are exposed to. Interstellar does not offer anything of these. It is a long and boring sermon about the future of Mankind in the universe, pretending to be the science-fiction movie. With this picture Christopher Nolan proved his only memorable work was Prestige and the Batman trilogy was not the accident, but the clear sign that his main achievements in Hollywood will be too long, boring and utterly disappointing pictures, initially rising hopes for a good time spent in the cinema, but leaving in a complete, sad disillusion after all.",

I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ...",

            "review": "So last night I got the chance to see the early screening of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. The film I've been waiting so much from the early days of the shooting. How did it fare? Here's my take:To avoid any tl;dr risk, let me get this straight from the very beginning, Interstellar is one goddamnedly good film, it gets you to the edge of your seat, it soars, it warps, it rips your brain senseless. It's that good.Interstellar is a story about the earth dying, with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn, and of course, it will lead to the extinction of humanity. Our hero is an ex-NASA test pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a typical ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary- situation everyman who's also a dedicated family man, especially toward his daughter Murphy (named after the Murphy's Law). In an all-too-Armageddon style our hero gets invited by the (publicly) defunct NASA to become humanity's last hope in finding a new home, for they have found a wormhole near Saturn (2001, anyone?) which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. Solid and compact premise, although it's been used before.For seasoned filmgoers, there are many similar elements (although it's understandable) with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). In a sense that this is not a bang-bang-shoot-shoot-blow-em-up sci-fi, but more of a slow-burning, metaphysical sci-fi which gets you to think about your place in the universe and your exact place in time.Similarity with 2001 and Contact is never a bad thing, but it becomes a wee bit too predictable, although Nolan is a smart enough director in providing the final (a very sentimental one, I should say) twist in the story. The visuals in this film is majestic, everything is shot to a meticulously calculated level, Nolan-style. The space scenes are serenely suspenseful just like Cuaron's Gravity, but unlike the documentary feel of Gravity, there's a real gusto and pace to these scenes. You should also be prepared for the (for some, maybe) unexpected third act, it is Nolan's most sentimental and humane moment to date. And this is why Interstellar is more than just a science-fiction, it is a human drama intertwined in space and time loop.One thing that Nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. Nolan was never a 'warm' director, his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair but it feels cold, it maybe suits Memento and The Dark Knight but in Interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the interpersonal drama or the sci-fi that will be Interstellar's forte. The result is a rather incongruous script, intermittently cutting off the excitement of the previous scene and so on. But it is a forgivable sin, for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film. At the end of the day, all I can say is that Interstellar is a grand film. It is monolithic, thoughtful, sentimental, sophisticated, visceral but also with its flaws. I wouldn't say it's Nolan's best work to date, but I daresay that this is one of the best science fiction ever released.After watching Interstellar, do yourself a favor and get lost in space and time and go back in time to see Contact (1997) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to further wonder and wander into the realms of the unknown.Because sometimes it is the unknown that fascinates us, frightens us and brings out the best in us.",

            "review": "A good friend of mine, the writer Mark Shulman, once pointed out that our standards are being gradually eroded, so that sadly, we are left with less and less in lieu of a threshold of acceptability, finding ourselves not unlike frogs in a pan being brought to a slow, imperceptible boil.Christopher Nolan and some of his cast are telling the press that Interstellar is a love story. I will take them at their word and assume that whatever else I picked up on was left there unwittingly, for the rest of us to parse through.Considering how much pain is involved in traveling to and from a crowded movie theater on a Saturday night, I feel like it's my prerogative, when I have paid good money, to take a film apart if I am still hungry for substance at the end of it; and I WILL get my nourishment from something or other, if not from the movie's plot itself.The first thing that strikes me, when I think back to the experience of Interstellar, is that it leaves me with nothing, emotionally - no takeaway. I did not care about any of its characters, or believe they were real, and I did not really worry about the fate of humanity (any more than the film itself actually does, beyond paying it casual lip-service).I wasn't awed like I may have been by other wondrous space movies that Interstellar measures itself against (or steals from), and I am not compelled to go back and see any part of it ever again. (I suspect most viewers won't either, once the collective neophile contact high has passed.)For starters, I do not like the moral core of the story: Interstellar is a film about \"saving humanity\" but it is unclear who will pay for humanity's failures. The film offers a great debate over where to repopulate, but none about what we have learned from having to leave our home in the first place. There is no therapy, no penance, no sacrifice. In a way, this represents a subconscious confession about our culture's moral failures: when we run out of spaces to consume, and out of fertile ground to slash an burn, we will have to look for new worlds to expand out into, since we cannot show self control and learn to care for what we have...But enough psychobabble. A dysfunctional moral compass is not the worst thing about Interstellar.The worst thing about the film is that, to quote my girlfriend, \"It's OK to for characters to talk in pseudo-scientific gobbledygook when the show is Star Trek, because in Star Trek, they all have pointy ears.\"Interstellar may be worth a glance, certainly for the photography and exciting visuals, but it is a buffet of messy ideas that fire in all directions. Clearly the script is not written by career screenwriters, but by a director who has freed himself from gravity and has achieved his own artificial self-sufficiency amid the vast nothingness.The result is an often far-fetched and unintelligible, outlandish tale which takes an awfully long time to suspend the viewer's disbelief (and cringing), to finally arrive at a tepid plot after about an hour or so.In hindsight, it makes perfect sense that Nolan's 'tightest' film is Memento, a dis-cognitive story told from the point of view of a man who is unable to string two events together, or to remember where he started.Interstellar is not an intelligent picture, but a pseudo-intelligent one. It seems designed to appeal to the sort of audience who loves to be flattered with cheap shots - a sort of space odyssey version of \"who wants to be a millionaire?\" Its success resting entirely on the fact that every member of the audience gets to feel superior. To whom? No one knows. This technique seems to be trending within the Nolan's filmography.For the rest, the picture is a narrative mess that trivializes space travel on a galactic scale, (black hole, wormhole, same difference,) and is often plagued by ridiculous star-studded cameos that shatter the viewer's concentration by landing in the middle of tense emotional scenes like a cockroach in your soup.The film is oddly timed with elliptical cuts that compress the action into some often confusing edits, and only leave in lieu of dialog some awful scenes of trite, contrived exposition, filled with emetic pseudo physics, sure to give an immature modern audience raised on Batman a sense that they are building their cultural ego by agreeing with this farce. Worst of all, it feels long and never ending.Sadly, good science fiction is hard to come by, harder than a good ordinary film even, and although this picture is somewhat entertaining, it fades away from the heart and mind, like the flickering green of the traffic light we just passed, as we head home from the cinema, once more.",

            "review": "Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, \"we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it.\" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that.",

            "review": "Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving \"business\" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the \"greatest films of all time\". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, \"Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?\" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to \"11\" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of \"oscillating\" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) \"zoom out\" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the \"greatest film of all time\" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a \"historical family saga\" as a crime or gangster film.",

I've seen it twice--a second time just to make sure--and I have to tell you that I sat there in a stupor, bored out of my mind.  And I'm not a teenager raised on MTV; I'm in my 30s and am absolutely devoted to movies--I've seen as many classics (American & foreign) that I can get my hands on.

But The Godfather?   It's just a bland epic about a bunch of moronic gangsters, with Marlon Brando giving a campy performance, and riddled with repulsive violence.  Give me a break.  The fact that this movie is so \"beloved\" has had the direct result that nowadays we got absurdly worse and worse films every year, created by clueless filmmakers.",

            "review": "First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.I thought \"The Godfather\" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's \"business\" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family \"business\" to the eventual \"Don.\"It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.6/10",

            "review": "It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. \"Citizen Kane\" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". \"The Godfather\" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.",

            "review": "I remember distinctly the first time I saw \"The Godfather\". I was a child and it was being shown on broadcast television.  Granted, neither of theses are optimal conditions for rendering an informed opinion but I remember being struck with how unremarkable- in fact how boring I found the film.  I was particularly surprised by this, as there had been a great fanfare over the broadcast. I chalked this up to my own immaturity and thought no more of it.The second time I saw the film was in college.  My friend had a brother who was quite a film enthusiast and he, like many others, counted \"The Godfather\" as the finest film.  One evening my friend and I watched the film.  The viewing once again left me unimpressed.  I feigned an enthusiasm for the film that I did not feel, as it seemed the popular, and even the intellectual expectation.  Once again I associated my dislike for the movie with a failing in myself. I apparently did not appreciate a \"good movie\" when I saw one.Since that time I have seen many films, from many directors, from many countries, in many languages, and with varying budgets from independent offerings to mainstream Hollywood fare.  I certainly do not consider myself to be an expert but feel myself to be an informed member of an audience. Armed with my experience I recently viewed \"The Godfather\" again to expunge my previous failures and to gleefully join the ranks of Godfather sycophants.  Well, I think you know the outcome.  As they say in baseball, three strikes and you're out.I find the film to be completely un-redeeming in every way.  I do not have space to address the film systematically or technically so I will speak to my central grievance- the story is hollow.  There is no moral center.I do not demand that a movie have morality.  I do not demand that a film even have a point.  I can take a film at its face value for what it is.  A slapstick comedy is foolish and an action flick is mindless, I do not ask that they be a different movie- only that they meet the narrow definition to which they aspire.  The problem is that \"The Godfather\" aspires to be a great drama and that aspiration comes with high expectations.Gratuitous violence is expected in big-budget action flicks, amorality can be understood in the quiet desperation of an independent film's philosophy, and self-indulgence is to be expected in the over-the-top musical extravaganza.  However, violence, amorality, and self-indulgence in a film that portrays itself as mainstream drama or even tragedy are reprehensible. This is not art- it is base voyeurism at its worst.  We are standing in the bailey at New Castle or at the Coliseum watching with leering stares at the baseness and depravity of man. This film is not a criticism of man's foul nature, as in the above referenced independent film; it is a celebration of it.  Anyone who claims otherwise deludes himself.Thus conceived I can appreciate `The Godfather' as a film oddity, a curious victory of the popularity of evil men.  But to say that it is a great film is scandalous, and to say that it is the greatest film is blasphemous.  To say that the highest achievement of man in film is a celebration of cruelty, deception, and greed is a statement that many should reconsider.I find it interesting that many of those who claim \"The Godfather\" as their favorite film, or the best film of all time can count their viewings of the film on one hand. In fact, I myself (who thinks unfavorably of the film) have given the film more attention then many of the \"fans\" I know.  A friend of mine who professes to like the film recently returned the box-set DVD \"Godfather\" collection that he received for Christmas.  As he put it, he loved the film but when was he ever going to watch it?  That is faint praise indeed for the \"greatest film of all time\".I am sure there are those who genuinely enjoy the film, but you could say that about any movie.  I would advise those who fawn over this film so to ask themselves if their enthusiasm comes from within or from a modern mythology. \"The Godfather\" is a paper tiger.",

Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did.

            "review": "Does \"Godfather\" romanticize crime and criminals? Yes, it does. Take, for instance, the Godfather's name \"Corleone\" which translates as \"Lionhearted,\" suggesting that the heroes are to be compared to Richard the Lionhearted, legendary chivalrous hero of the Crusades and friend to Robin Hood. There can be no doubt that author Mario Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola have made romantic idols of the Corleones, as the film gilds them with mystery, honor and gallantry. But of what Holy Crusade are the Corleones the leaders? Seemingly a war for survival against vicious enemies who would destroy their gang. But why should we care what happens to a bunch of evil criminals?\"Godfather\" is just as much interesting for what it fails to show the audience as what it does show. The film makers wrongly assume that the audience is sophisticated enough to infer the kind of lurid but educational scene that made such a great success of earlier gangster films, nitty gritty illustrations of the inside workings of organized crime: loan sharking, extortion and vice. \"Godfather\" for the most part ignores this subject matter, the everyday business of crime, in favor of what should be only the end part of its story: a war between gangs over control of the rackets. The drama is essentially without motivation. The movie is simply not interested in showing us much of the dirty business that is the reason for the war. That is because the heroes would seem much less chivalrous if their criminal enterprises were shown in any depth or with any real understanding. For most of its length, the movie plays as a revenge tragedy in which the gallant protagonists could be members of any great family (whether criminal or not) protecting their cherished honor.Why did the film makers deliberately sanitize the criminal aspect of the Corleone family? Are they apologists for crime? I think they are. One confidence game employed by the film makers, which is also familiar among the annals of organized crime leaders, is a variation on the trick called \"bait and switch.\" We expect a portrait of a ruthless and immoral criminal, instead we are made to believe in the essential moral rightness of Don Corleone when he condemns as a contemptible enemy the kind of criminal who trades in narcotics. In other words, we are lured into the theater with the promise of a true to life depiction of the actions of a bad guy, and then the film makers slyly pull a fast one and show us a good guy instead! (We are persuaded to ignore the fact that the Godfather is an extortionist and pimp  even worse we are asked to believe that extortion and pimping are not so bad, especially if practiced by an honorable guy like Don Corleone, who, whatever his failings, is much too decent to trade in narcotics.)This jiggery pokery was so effective that around the time the movie and its sequel came out an ivy league educated friend of mine on his way to a brilliant career on Wall Street bitterly denounced a critic of \"Godfather\" for making the claim that Don Corleone was not entitled to be regarded as a great hero like President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, General Douglas MacArthur or Doctor Albert Schweitzer, who had received similarly adulatory treatment in film. My friend, having seen both Godfathers, was convinced that a Mafia leader might be just as honorable as the heroic portrait the movies presented.So, I feel some need on this occasion to remind the public of what the Mafia does, even when they allegedly refuse to get involved in narcotics sales. The Mafia is mainly in the business of Vice. It feeds off the weaknesses of a mass of little people who are corruptible, who are vulnerable to the appeal of easy sex, cheap thrills, quick money and quick fixes of their problems. These little people pay for their vices all their lives, much more than they can afford to pay, and end up ruined for the greater glory of the Mafia. Most racket crime is not glorious; it is petty and mean and easily committed by anyone who has less courage or daring than the average person. But it's easy to understand why the film makers left this out of the movie. It would be kind of absurd to call a scuzzy dirtbag by the name \"Lionheart.\"",

Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred \"Goodfellas\". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.8/10",

            "review": "Director David Mackenzie wasn't on my radar until 2016's HELL OR HIGH WATER, which I highly recommend. He has now made a paranoid thriller called RELAY. Originally called THE BROKER, it was featured on the 2019 \"Black-List\" of most-liked unproduced screenplays. It tells the story of whistleblower Sarah Grant (Lilly James) who changes her mind about going public with very sensitive and damning documents from a big bioengineering company. She is recommended to call an anonymous broker to help give back the documents while keeping herself safe. The broker, played by Riz Ahmed, keeps his anonymity by using a telecommunications device for the deaf, connected to the Tri-State Relay Service. It's a pretty cool concept that uses a totally real service in such a creative way. This movie feels bigger than it actually is. There was almost no marketing for it, so almost nobody is actually watching it. I'm a huge fan of Riz Ahmed. Ever since he broke out in the series THE NIGHT OF, he's been doing great things. This is the second movie with him that represents the deaf community, the other being the wonderful SOUND OF METAL. As I've been thinking more about this movie's ending though, without giving anything away, I think it could've been a little smoother, especially in today's society. I also think a little more mystery was needed in certain aspects. Riz's palpable quiet intensity and the nice tension-building are what ultimately drew me into this. I enjoyed my time with RELAY, and I wish it had a wider release.",

Everything falls apart when, for the first time, he breaks his own rules: a new client doesn't want profit but protection, determined to survive at any cost.On paper, this could have been a decent thriller. On screen, however, it's a dull and dragging affair. The script never evolves beyond its logline. The narrative stalls, the momentum only kicks in toward the end - far too late - and the twist fails to impress.The positives: competent direction and a solid cast. Yet the characters are flat cutouts, with the lone exception of the protagonist. Sam Worthington and Willa Fitzgerald do what they can, but they're given nothing of substance to play. Willa's character, for some reason, is constantly chewing - a bizarre choice, more puzzling than meaningful.The film is riddled with plot holes, contrivances, and narrative \"miracles\" that collapse under scrutiny.

Was debating whether to go, but it was \"revealed\" early that it was Relay, so based on the previews I'd seen decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did.This was well and cleverly written. Some might be bored by some of the repetitiveness of some of the scenes, the main character's methodological preparations for everything he did to protect his client (and to keep order in his own life - you'll understand why when you see the movie). And the repetitiveness all makes sense as the movie comes together.The acting is excellent. Have always loved the two main players, Riz Ahmed and Lily James. While not an \"action\" movie in the traditional sense of the word, I would still consider this to be in the \"thriller\" category. The tension is often palpable, the cat and mouse quite clever. And the twistiness towards the end is both surprising and fun.Despite it's thriller-ish attitude, it is also a fairly small, quiet movie. There is little dialog other than conversation through the Tri-State Relay System, which gives much of that dialog an almost robotic feeling. But it works, and actually adds to the tension.I won't give anything away. To do so would spoil the fun. This one is worthwhile.",

The premise and execution feels like a mobie that would be made during the old days of Hollywood and I mean that in a good way. The writing in this movie is so smart and clever with everything happening and you feel the sense of urgency and tension with every scene that plays out. The performances from Riz Ahmed, Lily James and Sam Worthington are amazing and you can tell that they are committed to these roles. There is some good action sequences here, but the movie is focused on the thriller aspect and that was the best thing this movie could've done. And finally, I love the way how this movie wraps up the story for the characters and it comes to a satisfying conclusion.Negatives for Relay (2025):\nThe pacing of the movie is off as there are scenes that play out much longer than they should be.Overall, Relay (2025) was one of the most intense and interesting movies I've watched in 2025 so far and I highly recommend that you make it a priority to watch this movie when you have the chance.",

It's unfortunate to say because it's clear that the filmmakers are wanting to create something fun and Logan Lerman and Molly Gordon both are doing their best. However by simply creating a modern-like version of Misery but with romance, drama, teen vibes, and absurd nature blended together to make a non-serious approach doesn't work. Rather, it becomes repetitive, annoying, and frustrating. Conventional frustrating character decisions and annoying forced absurd nature, it felt as if the filmmakers watched Jennifer's Body and somehow misunderstood the comedic purpose and tone, and decided to make a more messy absurd feature that comes off more edgy and forced, rather something brilliant.To top it off with terrible characters and awful dialogue, it becomes more an aggravating experience. Many of the characters personalities feel like Hollywood cliches, the production designs are cheap, and the musical score was pretty overbearing. I do understand it's meant to be non-serious, but the issue is that the writing and poor approach doesn't really do justice. It comes off as sloppy and doesn't seem to have a real strong purpose.Props for Lerman and Gordon for doing their best tho.",

The actors were funny and likable, and the idea is amusing, but the way the entire film is presented makes it feel like a script that was written by a grade school child.Firstly, I'll talk about the good. The opening 20-30 minutes was cute. The actor's chemistry mixed with some gorgeous cinematography made for quite the romantic setting. I was thoroughly enjoying what I was seeing. It's when the awkward sex scene mixed with the handcuffs begins that the film gets beyond bizarre and the story slips into someone's weird and childish fantasy brought to life.The decisions the characters made had no real world weight to them. I mean for the plot to work, both of the main characters would have to have the mental capacity of a 13 year old. No adult would do the things that are done in the film. From the whole hostage situation in hopes for love, all the way up to doing the witchy seance scene that was something only a teenage girl would think of. It all just seemed so unrealistic and far removed from anything remotely palpable.The ending also left a lot to be desired. There is absolutely no way, and I mean NO WAY, that I would've been the one apologizing after being handcuffed to a bed for 48 hours, and enduring what the main character had to endure for more than half of the film's runtime. Nor would she be the one I would be calling help for after, literally, speeding away from what was at that point a crime scene.On the flipside, if a person didn't want a relationship, I honestly can't think of anybody that would take them out for a weekend together in the countryside. Complete with pretty music, wine, romance and all the extra things you could think of. And we're talking proposal level romantic here. The creator must have a really low opinion of males to think that this is a real thing someone would do for just a bit of fun. It's borderline offensive.Overall, I can't recommend it. Far too unrealistic, and campy but in all the wrong ways. Again, this felt like a teenager's fantasy brought to life, but the film was far too adult for anything a teenager could be allowed to watch. All I could think of at the credits was the creator must have the mind of a child, and I wonder who hurt her to make this screenplay happen. The first 20-30 minutes are very sweet, but ultimately misleading as to the context of the rest of the film. And although the film does have some interesting points to make about love and the fear of relationships, it was just too dumb to be taken as anything more than a footnote in the larger picture here.2 broken hearts out of 5.",

            "review": "Recently, I had the opportunity to attend an early screening of a film that, to be honest, I now wish I hadn't seen. Going into the theater, I had moderate expectations, hoping at the very least for a compelling narrative or standout performances. Unfortunately, what unfolded on screen was a sluggish, disjointed, and ultimately disappointing experience that left me more frustrated than entertained.From the outset, the movie struggled with pacing. The story trudged along without a clear direction or sense of urgency, and scenes often felt stretched far beyond their purpose. It was as though the filmmakers were trying to build tension or depth, but instead, they created a slow, meandering plot that failed to hold attention. Instead of drawing me in, it made me painfully aware of each passing minute. I've had dreams more compelling and coherent than this film's storyline-and that's not hyperbole.The core plot was muddled and, worse, problematic in several key areas. One of the most concerning elements of the film was its depiction of domestic violence and how that subject was handled. Rather than thoughtfully exploring the complexity of this issue, especially as it affects men-who are often overlooked and underrepresented in these narratives-the film seemed to ignore the reality of male victims. Instead of offering a nuanced or empathetic perspective, it left the impression that men are either not believable or not worth supporting when they come forward. This is not just an oversight; it's a dangerous message to send.As the film progressed, any hope for resolution or depth in its treatment of serious themes evaporated. By the end, there was a strange sense of forgiveness and closure that felt entirely unearned. The characters seemed to brush past major trauma and complex emotional wounds with little to no reckoning. It gave the impression that the writers were more concerned with wrapping things up neatly than dealing with the gravity of what had unfolded. This approach felt not only unrealistic but insensitive.The film also dipped into elements of witchcraft and the supernatural, which might have been intriguing in a more cohesive or stylized narrative. Instead, these elements felt out of place and poorly integrated. Rather than adding to the atmosphere or offering symbolic weight, they seemed like distractions-poorly executed attempts to spice up an otherwise flat script.As for the performances, the actors did what they could with the material they were given. It's clear that the cast tried to bring some life to the lifeless script, and at times, there were flashes of genuine talent. But even the best acting can't save a film burdened with bad writing, weak character development, and unclear thematic intentions. In this case, the cast was ultimately let down by the script, the direction, and the overall lack of coherence in the story.The movie also contained multiple sexually explicit scenes, most of which felt gratuitous rather than meaningful. Instead of serving the narrative or deepening the characters, these scenes seemed thrown in for shock value or filler. Combined with the other tonal inconsistencies and underdeveloped themes, they only contributed to the film's overall feeling of confusion and lack of direction.In the end, it's difficult to imagine this movie surviving long at the box office or leaving any kind of meaningful mark. Between the poor pacing, the troubling thematic choices, the lackluster writing, and the uneven tone, there's little here to recommend. I walked out of the theater not just disappointed, but genuinely concerned about the kind of message this film sends-especially regarding sensitive issues like domestic violence.This was a missed opportunity on all fronts.",

I didn't expect much because I hadn't even heard of it, but it turned out way better than anticipated. It has one of those absolutely bonkers premises that somehow works. The opening pulls you in quickly, and the cast has great chemistry that carries the film.From the start, I genuinely had no idea the story would take the turns it did, I assume maybe the trailer could be revealing but I hadn't seen it. The handcuffs gave me vague \"Gerald's Game\" vibes, though this takes things in a much more comedic direction. Her making breakfast had me laughing out loud. The movie just generally a lot of laughs from everybody.It's definitely a \"shut your brain off to enjoy\" kind of film. Some character decisions aren't the most logical, but the humor makes it work. Molly's descent into chaos was oddly believable; it was wild but never so over the top that it pulled me out of it. It does lose a bit of momentum in the middle, with the characters(plus you, yourself watching) just waiting to see how this all ends. But the finale ties everything up nicely.I was surprised I hadn't seen this movie advertised anywhere, but turns out this screening was a month before the official release. Hopefully, more people see it then because it worth a watch. All four, or five, of the main actors have great performances and chemistry which is what made the movie fun. Especially Molly Gordon.Also, side note, it always blows my mind how long it takes to make movies. Every Q&A I've been to has someone saying, \"we've been working on this for 7 years.\"I also hope the blooopers for this come out, I feel like it'd be a really fun watch.",

But I think the film delivers a hilarious movie with some excellent comedy throughout the movie as I found myself to truly be dying at some of the jokes thrown in this movie as they really did land for me and I found myself to have a great time with this film and the comedy elements thrown into this film. I found the romantic parts to be intriguing as well and found our leads to be such interesting characters and I really loved these characters of Iris played by Molly Gordon and also Isaac played by Logan Lerman who personally was my favorite character in this film and I really loved his performance. My one complaint with the characters is I wish they had more depth to them and sometimes in my personal opinion in some scenes they feel bland and boring but other than that I really do like these characters a lot. I also really liked the story they told in this film as I honestly expected to go into a Rom-Com but I was kind of surprised by the direction they take the romantic elements in this movie as I really found this direction to be really interesting for me and I really liked the direction they took as it didn't feel like every other boring rom-com with nothing going on in this film but I found this film to be a really fun and hilarious time. One other complaint in my opinion is I'm not the biggest fan of the ending since it felt like everything happened so quickly and I wish the movie would've been longer so we could've explored some of this stuff that happened at the end some more and it felt sort of rushed near the end in my personal opinion but other than my little complaints I found myself to have a great time with this movie and going into this movie with no expectations at all I was pleasantly surprised with this movie and I honestly throughly enjoyed it and I think this is worth checking out in theaters for sure once it officially releases theatrically.",

I'm older (late 50s) but I enjoyed it but I do think this might work for the younger crowd more.There were many moments that I thought it was going to turn into a horror film but never did but that's fine as I felt the characters were interesting and enjoyable to watch and it was fresh to have the what should've been expected not happen.Not disappointed.",

I thought I was going to see a good slightly comedic love (or not love) story, that was well written and well acted.The strawberry lady and the whole buying all the strawberries she had made me giggle. The romance of the couple seeing their getaway house was so sweet. But when Iris tries to perform to keep the guy and he's trapped on the bed, I got bored. She was telling him stories, behaving manically, it seemed like a long monologue. There were isolated short parts that were funny. Like Max confessing to her boyfriend or the neighbor guy or Iris hurting her back trying to turn at the foot of the bed.But it seemed as if they were just putting things in hoping something stuck. I don't like when movies are too formulaic (this movie isn't), but the movie needed some structure in the writing and storytelling.

            "review": "Many years ago I made the tragic error of breaking up with a woman at my place. I was young, dumb and unaware of the rules of disengagement. With no means of escape the situation turned into a protracted nightmare from which I still suffer PTSD.Nothing compares to the uncoupling gaffe Logan Lerman's Isaac is responsible for in Director Sophie Brooks' new feature Oh Hi!. It is as perplexing as it is unforgiveable except for the fact the movie would be a 20 minute short without it.Isaac and Molly Gordon's Iris are on an idealized version of a romantic getaway in upstate New York. There's oodles of sex, seafood and sunsets. The fun comes to a whiplash inducing halt when the young (ish) lovers realize they do not share the same relationship goals. Iris wants to lock it down while Isaac wants to keep things chill.Throughout Oh Hi! There is a hint of detachment to Lerman's Isaac which comes more into full view during his brief mea culpa in the third act.Gordon, for her part, plays Iris with a yearning sweetness that turns into progressively manic behaviour (there's my PTSD again).Oh Hi!'s biggest flaws are the broader comedic elements such as handcuffs and witchcraft. Perhaps Brooks and Gordon knew their story/script didn't have the chops to match something like Celine Song's recent Materialists or better yet Past Lives. In lieu of letting words do the talking they went a little high concept for a relationship dramedy.Perhaps it is odd for me to say but Oh Hi! Made me harken back to Peter Berg's 1998 Very Bad Things. I thought I was getting a film about a group of normal guys who take things too far at a bachelor party. Instead Christian Slater's Robert is a psychopath and this helped make Very Bad Things a Very Bad Movie. In the middle section of Oh Hi! Iris behaves almost as CRAZY as Robert. Something a little more grounded would have been better.We are entrenched in an era of filmmaking where accountability and female characters go together like vampires and sunlight. It all started with Reese Witherspoon's Cheryl in 2014's Wild and hit a baffling zenith with Nicole Kidman's Romy in 2024's Babygirl. In the latter film, if we gender swapped the two lead roles, the male CEO would end up in prison by the 25th minute.Oh Hi! Is to be commended for only allowing Iris partially off the hook. The film leans into the fact Iris is behaving like the stereotypical manic female. She obsesses over Isaac, latching onto minor details and refusing to see any way forward which isn't together.Brooks and Gordon create a female character it appears not only wants a man but needs one. Oh Hi! May get them uninvited from the Hollywood radical feminist book club - second wave, I believe. The movie isn't always good but it is rather exceptional in how it doesn't outright hate or blame men for the onscreen action.In fact, Oh Hi! Has a large amount of affection for the type of non threatening, non alpha typified by Isaac and John Reynolds' Kenny. Men like this are soft spoken and don't know how to drive. They will, however, cook a girl a mean scallop and go down on her in broad daylight.Sounds like progress for all involved.",

            "review": "This is the worst movie that I have EVER had the displeasure of watching. I have never before been so upset with a movie that I felt the need to write a review over it, and I saw Cats. It fails on every single count of what makes a good movie. I do not know how this movie has the rating it does; it genuinely boggles my mind. Do not let the rating fool you. It is, simply put, not worth watching. Let's begin with my favorite aspect of a good movie, the writing. If I were asked to sum up this movie's writing in a single word, that word would be \"stupid\". It is genuinely nonsensical. Any dinosaur movie will naturally have logical inconsistencies and plot holes; that is what happens when screenwriters have to think of a way to make creatures that died out over 65 million years ago pose a threat now. It would be unreasonable to expect a \"realistic\" explanation for this, which is not a fair standard, as a viewer must assume a certain level of suspension of disbelief. HOWEVER, a self-respecting movie should at least have decency of internal consistency and compelling characters, both of which are sorely absent. The plot is both nonsensical and inconsistent; the dinosaurs are extremely lethal and bulletproof in one scene and in the next have the strength and durability of wet tissue paper. The same can be said of characters' weapons, skills, intelligence, etc. The character development and emotional appeal are hamfisted at best, nonexistent at worst. There is more chemistry and emotional depth demonstrated within two T. Rexes interacting in a ~15-second clip than the entire rest of the characters combined. The explanations are obviously techno-babble that violates several laws of physics and shows a complete misunderstanding of basic science, but that's to be expected with a movie of this quality. The plot is overall exceptionally weak. So much so that, as someone who used to tutor students, I have seen better writing skills, both in narrative consistency and development, in a literal twelve-year-old. This writing is an insult to good cinema writing. It is so bad that I would like to call it AI-generated, in dire hope that no human screenwriter could think this level of writing is acceptable on a screen, but that would be an insult to AI. The acting is not much better. It is better for sure. I cannot argue that it isn't, but that is a very, very, low bar. Most of the lines and performances are flat and uninspired, the pronunciation of basic words like \"Ruski\" is wrong, and the Russian (as a native speaker) is terrible, as are the Russian accents. The redeeming factor of this movie could have been its visual appeal and sound design. Unfortunately, it is not. The jungles are actually rather pretty, but the fight scenes, which make up a large chunk of the movie, are obnoxiously loud, jumbled messes of quick cuts. The CGI is subpar, especially when it comes to injuries, as they often don't match up with what is shown. Sound design is not great either. I am by no means an expert, but even I noticed instances of noise not lining up with what's happening on screen and generally low-tier CGI. The visual appeal is definitely the strongest suit, though that is a low bar. I struggle to think of positive remarks to make about this movie, so I will simply conclude with a summary and overall points. I am not an overly pretentious snob, while I prefer movies like Oppenheimer over movies like Rambo, I still enjoyed Rambo. Some movies have a great cast with exceptional acting that pulls you right into the scene and grips your attention. Other movies have a gripping narrative that develops naturally and is perfectly timed. Others still are just plain fun to watch and delight in the sound and visual design, even if they might be weaker on the first two elements. Sometimes movies can even be so bad, fail so profoundly that they are hilarious and still fun to watch, like \"Sharknado\" or \"Shark Side of the Moon\". This movie is none of these things. It fails on every count of being remotely enjoyable, and frankly, I am embarrassed that I bought tickets and in some small way benefited the people who created it. DO NOT WATCH.",

If you're a fan of dinosaurs and want a mature tone for your dinosaur media than this is right up your alley, it's not a field trip in the jungle it's a fight for survival and seeing that in a serious tone with consequences was great to see on the big screen. As Luke Sparke said on InGeneral: The Jurassic Outpost Podcast, he said he loves randomness with his dinosaurs and them just being animals and you get a lot of that in this movie. From grazing, to hunting (some were on demon mode), to sleeping they captured the dinosaurs in a great way (while showing off how dangerous and deadly they are).The Marines and their story took me by surprise with how good it was and how they got a story and honestly the struggles of war and PTSD and just mental health was captured really well and something that caught me off guard. The characters were good and did their job only some were a tad questionable but it's not that bad. The dialogue was good and I was surprised with how funny it was? I guess because it is a war movie set in Vietnam you can use colourful language and they didn't shy away from it and it really sets the tone.The gore was INTENSE and I'm definitely not use to seeing that in a Dinosaur movie and it was a nice change showing how dangerous a dinosaur is and so much death, I honestly lost count in the first 15 mins there was so much and it was fun a fun WILD ride. For an independent film, the scale is amazing I honestly can't get over how great it was and you can just tell how much passion is in this movie, Luke Sparke is like us A HUGE dinosaur fan that achieved his dream and made his dinosaur movie, I genuinely think you should check it out if you love Dinosaurs and as a Jurassic Park/World fan we need competition and competition breeds greatness, we need more dinosaur media in general and this is the right way forward as a Dinosaur fan.

Ryan Kwanten is the king of B movies and he doesn't let anyone down in this one. I was worried in the first twenty minutes or so because it really felt like they were trying so hard to get you to care about the characters and I really couldn't, they felt flat. But an hour in I cared about all of them. The subplot with how the dinos came to be in Vietnam was also ridiculous but in the best possible way. I don't want to give any spoilers because I think you should just see it in the theater while you have a chance, I don't think it'll be the same watching it at home. A lot of it is also shot very very dark so I can imagine it being difficult to see exactly what's going on watching on a TV screen. Jeremy Piven, say what you want about him, is also hilariously over the top in his performance. You can tell he had a lot of fun with this. There's a specific scene with a tiger that had me actually laugh out loud a little, and then a scene near the end in a helicopter where he's yelling that got me laughing again.

The military porn is hopeless (every American military stereotype to the point it's an absolute insult to every soldier who's put on the uniform), and the dinosaurs go from being impervious to bullets to being able to be hacked apart by a tired grunt with a machete in the same, final scene?!The dinosaurs looked decent (one star of the 3), and there were a few genuinely deep moments (the leader [sergeant, I think? They were so generic I couldn't have cared less] having a moment with a soldier who's going through a mental health crisis brought me right back to a similar moment I shared in Afghanistan, and the mother and father T-Rex nuzzling were real, unlike the other 99% of the movie).

While Deverakonda delivers on his promise of a strong portrayal, the film's narrative execution, particularly in its storytelling and screenplay, falls significantly short of making it an engaging cinematic experience.Vijay Deverakonda is undoubtedly the film's greatest asset. He carries the movie with his intense screen presence and delivers a compelling performance that stands out. His dedication to the role is evident, and he proves his capabilities even when the material around him falters.However, the core narrative of \"Kingdom\" feels underdeveloped and lacks a cohesive flow. The storytelling struggles to maintain momentum, making it difficult for the audience to stay invested in the plot. The screenplay appears to be one of the film's major weaknesses, preventing the story from unfolding in a consistently engaging manner. This leads to parts of the film feeling rather average and failing to capture the viewer's full attention.While the film may boast impressive visuals or a strong background score (as per other reviews), these elements are ultimately overshadowed by the uninspired plot and its execution. The lack of a gripping narrative arc means that even the high points don't land with the impact they should.Overall, \"Kingdom\" (2025) is a film that might appeal to fans of Vijay Deverakonda, who delivers a noteworthy performance. However, its weak story narration and unengaging screenplay prevent it from being a truly satisfying or memorable cinematic outing.",

The production values are impressive-locations are picturesque, sets and props are tastefully designed, and the costumes and makeup are neatly done. The cinematography is rich and adds visual appeal, while the background score enhances a few key moments, though it doesn't stay memorable. Two of the fight sequences stand out with slick choreography and decent buildup-they offer some of the film's rare bursts of energy.The direction doesn't falter entirely, but it doesn't elevate the film either. With a sharper script and more emotional depth, this could have been a far more engaging watch. As it stands, it's a film that plays it safe and ends up being just about tolerable.

Through the lens of black comedy, the film highlights the absurdities and contradictions inherent in modern work culture. Park's signature style is evident in the meticulous framing, darkly ironic tone, and clever use of paradox, which gives the narrative both intellectual bite and emotional resonance.The strength of the piece lies in its ability to provoke thought without overstaying its welcome. Each scene balances humor with critique, revealing the subtle ways in which societal pressures and corporate hierarchies strip individuals of autonomy and humanity. While brief, the film succeeds in creating a memorable impression, leveraging satire to make its message resonate well beyond its runtime.Though limited by its short format, which naturally constrains character development and plot complexity, the work excels in precision and thematic clarity. Park's acute observation of social dynamics, combined with a taste for paradoxical storytelling, makes this a notable addition to his oeuvre and a smart, incisive commentary on work and society.",

We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there.",

With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael  Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the \"damsel-in-distress\"  stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than \"Begins\"  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than \"Begins.\" The  action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud  Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who  sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing  in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may  feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I  will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a  human being and father to his daughter Matilda  Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his  daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this  role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented  actor.  Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008.",

After each of the prequel \"Star Wars\" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for \"Dark Knight\".Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, \"Dark Knight\" ably stands on its own with or without \"Batman Begins\". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the \"Batman\" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in \"Batman Forever\", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.\"The Dark Knight\" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.",

With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it.But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece.

I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. \"The Dark Knight\" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!",

I loved the TV show when I was a kid, really enjoyed the early Tim Burton films and have even worn the costume on a few occasions. I've even taken the time to read Batman comics and graphic novels. I thought Christian Bale was an excellent choice of the lead role for the new films and thought the first one was a great start and I was really looking forward to this one. So how come I've just walked out of the cinema feeling very disappointed? Why? Because this film just wasn't that good. It's far too long, has very little fun in it and takes itself so seriously it's painful. The makers have thrown the kitchen sink at it with very little thought. The whole thing was one great, big, dreadful, noisy, mess. The only good thing in it is Heath Ledger's performance. I had my doubts when I first heard who'd they'd cast but I gotta hand it to Heath, he pulled it off. No thanks to the film however, which is so over cooked it's burnt. Sure there's loads of action, cool bat gadgets and lots of running about and shouting but absolutely no soul. It was great looking but has no personality. I felt neither happy, scared or even mildly concerned let alone entertained. I really didn't give a damn. So next time people, slim it down, less is more. It's not Apocalypse Now, put some fun into it.....Why so serious?",

Or maybe it was my adrenaline rushing when two 12 year old were attacked by velociraptors.  It might possibly be the chills that went down my spine when the T-Rex first made his terrifying roar.  Whatever it was, it made me write this review.Allan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie (Laura Dern) are two successful paleontologists who are asked by a rich man John Hammond to come at his park for a major tour.  They agree and are taken to an island where \"Jurassic Park\" logos are everywhere.  The two paleontologists have no idea what they are getting themselves into.  The first dinosaur to make an apearance is the Brachiosaurus, which both of them are extrememly amazed by its giant apearance, and so is the audience.  What the two of them don't know is that there are much more terrifying and carnivorous dinosaurs who are about to escape and run loose....Directed by the mighty Steven Speilberg, Jurassic Park relied on more character development than any other creature-feature.  Usually you get second-rate actors who can't act, getting terrified by monsters that don't really exist.  Jurassic Park was the opposite.  It changed the way we looked at the world, and it will forever.  Based on the novel by Micheal Crichton, Jurassic Park was an amazing movie.From beginning to end, Jurassic Park bedazzled us with dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs that are EXTINCT.  There are a lot of cool cameos and the stars give great performances.  The whole family should watch this movie.  Not for the glossy title, but because of the dinosaurs.  I remember being a kid when I first watched it, and I remember loving this movie so bad.  The climax was excellent, and I am not saying what happens, unlike the sequel to this film (Jurassic Park 3).  A climax-less bad film, that was.  But this....this was magic.  And yes, it was a masterpiece.The magic of this film is what brought me into dinosaurs, too.  I had a \"Jurassic Park\" marathon today and I watched this movie, and I can still feel the magic.  You will feel the magic too once you see it.  I just have absolutely nothing to say except that Steven Speilberg will put a spell on you.  Even if you don't like creature-features, this movie will entertain you.  Steven Speilberg will take you to places that no one else ever will. And the \"life will find a way\" speech is here, ready to make someone feel that creating dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years is a good thing.Absolutely needless to say, Jurassic Park was a golden diamond.10/10 (One of the greatest films ever made)",

            "review": "In the year 1993, Hollywood saw something unlike anything else, the film Jurassic Park. Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.The plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn't seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn't the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.This is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn't even in the top 250. Today, people don't appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90's, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn't understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.This spawned two sequels. The second one wasn't bad, but the third wasn't very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.The story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone's life is at stake.The special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.Younger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren't scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.I highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.Watch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.Enjoy",

True, it is the fourth highest grossing movie ever (for the time being) and was a motion picture bible for eight-year-olds across the country, but it has never been regarded as artistically superior. When, in reality, it is one of the most artistically inventive movies ever. It contains all of Spielberg's magical strokes of genius from fantastic art direction and wonderful camera techniques to astounding technical quality ( which comes from his well known control over technology). The minor flaws of a theme park are masterfully embedded into the art direction, script etc. and the acting is superb. This is one of the only movies I've seen with great acting by children. Spielberg's camera usage ranges from foreshadowing the appearance of dinosaurs with extreme up-angles to exquisitely composed scenes of the dinosaurs' \"interaction\" with the characters. Aside from technical quality, Jurassic Park bears powerful social messages of human intrusion and destruction of natural environment and the self-revering nature of man. Also, it had an undeniable effect on cinema being one of the first movies to use CGI at such a large scale. However, the most ingenious aspect of the film is the portrayal of the dinosaurs as animals rather than ruthless monsters. At many times throughout the movie, the humans are portrayed as antagonists and the respect and appreciation of the dinosaurs is wonderfully developed. And, best of all, like star wars you can analyze the movie all you want or just sit back and enjoy the ride.",

I was eleven when I read the book, but all the technical stuff lost me and I never finished it. A couple years later when I heard the movie was coming out, I decided I would just see it instead. With advance tickets selling out fast, my mom was lucky enough to get some a few days before it's premiere. We stood in line for roughly thirty minutes before we finally got in. Even as the lights were dimming, I still had no idea what to expect. Within moments I was glued to my seat. The opening sequences remains one of my favorite scenes in any film and continues to give me goosebumps to this day. For the next two hours, I sat in my seat just staring at the screen as these marvelous, life-like creatures that were unlike anything I had ever seen before. The film was full of awe and scares. I walked out of the theater virtually trying to catch my breath. What a thrill ride the film had been, and I eventually went back and saw it a few more times. The film was a turning point in my life, as I said, because I walked out saying to myself, \"That's what I want to do.\" Sure the characters aren't deep and the dialogue isn't great, but who cares when the film is this entertaining? The actors are good in their parts, especially the always great Sam Neill, and the dinosaurs are incredibly life-like. The action is great, and the pacing (after a slow start) is relentless.

The acting was spectacular, and aside from how wonderful the creatures look and how vicious and exciting they were like no other dinosaur film had had them before, the plot and characters were solid and incredibly entertaining where you didn't think they would be so amusing.I will have to say again that one really huge reason why most people loved this movie was because of the special effects, but here again, isn't that an accomplishment in itself? Having your audience enjoy the film because of how realistic and fresh you are able to make it feel and look? I have never seen another movie with better effects than this one, ever. I am sure none of these horrible effects dinosaur movies that have been coming out lately could ever live up to the greatness of Jurassic Park.I am always going to love Jurassic Park for it's witty, unbelievable maneuvers and incredible screenplay though, as well. It was so properly thought out and executed, where most might have been expecting it to be nothing but high levels of adrenaline rushes with brainless action, which there was pulsating action, it just certainly wasn't as mindless. Many who dislike Jurassic Park really just have all the same reasons the average movie-goer would have for disliking a film, yet I haven't heard anyone fully describe and explain, well, what they truly thought were faults with this film, which gives me reason to believe that Jurassic Park is a masterpiece, for I, myself, have no faults with this film, except that I have seen other films that I enjoyed more. . . just a little more.",

While some of the exclusively digital dinosaurs don't hold up quite as well as the rest (despite having been only relatively recently surpassed by their peers - depending on budgetary constraints, of course), there are times when the superb CG almost seamlessly blends with possibly the best practical effects I've ever seen to create phenomenally believable, groundbreaking special-effects that truly are, still to this day, some of the best of their kind. Seriously, both the Raptor rigs and, specifically, the to-scale T-Rex are nothing short of breathtaking. They work so well not only due to the flick's fantastic technical prowess but also thanks to its beautiful blending of its core techniques (those created by clay and those by computer), its legitimate reactions from the compelling characters and its uncanny ability to put the audience right in the middle of it all, making you feel genuine wonder, fear, suspense and elation as if you're really sat alongside these long-extinct creatures. It's difficult to stress just how important the characters are in making it all so utterly believable, as well as so utterly captivating. Each of them feel like fleshed-out people, written to perfection by screenwriters who know how to get information across to the audience in a very organic way. It's almost as entertaining watching these people just converse with one another, discussing the morals of bringing extinct creatures back from the dead, as it is seeing them navigate the survival situation in which they are inevitably placed. It is only because we care so much about all the core players that the suspense sequences work so well, that we are kept on the edge of our seat every time a dinosaur lurks around the corner and that we grip our chairs when they leap for their prey. These scenes are some of the best in cinema, perfectly constructed with restraint and splendour. It's also difficult to describe how affecting even the simple moments can be, the moments in which we are asked to sit back and stare at the mere sight of a dinosaur. These should have dampened with time and yet they haven't, still eliciting the awe they did when they first hit the big-screen. They emulate the imagined magic of seeing one of these animals in real life for the first time. Running underneath all of this are some compelling themes that eagerly invite analysis, with the central debate being a tough and intriguing one. The picture is simply one of the most engaging I've ever seen, one that puts an ear-to-ear smile on your face just because it's so utterly amazing. It balances all of its core tenants impeccably, being a proper 'summer blockbuster' that's incredibly intelligent as well, to the point that every second is just supreme entertainment. It can make you lean forward in your seat or well-up with awe and, in general, have a blast from beginning to end. The movie is, without a doubt, a true masterpiece. 10/10",

The lumber some walking and bobbing of heads that Hollywood often adopts for dinosaurs is highly uncommon in modern cold blooded reptiles. Even the giant Gila Monsters move swiftly with grace and dexterity. The dramatic human like personalities of the dinosaurs is another purely Hollywood stunt. Yes, velociraptors may have the physiological ability to open a door, but without human reasoning, they wouldn't know \"why\" to open one. The biggest underlying question throughout the movie is \"why?\". Why do the dinosaurs want to kill? Why aren't the characters more surprised and ask more questions? Why are there kids on the island? Why did the director let so many slip-ups pass through the final cut? Why did the boy survive a 10,000 volt electric shock?

Despite being filmed in the 90s, Jurassic Park continues to be a classic to this day. \nWatching the movie now highlights the contrast between the effects then and the special effects available now. This, along with some acting that is a tad overdone, are the only real critiques I would give this film. \nThe child actors were especially hilarious to me-the young boy, Timmy, has moments that really capture a reaction that a child in real life would have (\"I threw up.\" \"Well that's ok! That happens sometimes\"-Allen-is one of my favorite quotes). \nAnother extremely influential aspect of this film is the music that plays over certain intense scenes and the iconic theme music in the opening/closing. The music combined with the diegetic sound of the dinosaur stomping/approaching builds the suspense and creates an intense tension in the audience. \nAs a classic worldwide, it's no wonder that this movie provided the basis for generations of movies to follow.",

            "review": "Jurassic Park was surely a tremendous ground breaking event. Spielberg is at his best here.  The special effects are fantastic and each scene has a special tension and effect of its own.  Spielberg weaves a magic web and pleases everyone in the process.  He puts in a few things here and there to please the more liberal in the audience as well as the more traditional.  He even sends messages to the critics with words such as sexism to try and appease the media critics.Spielberg also has us rooting against every one who dies and for everyone who lives.  He even gets the audience to laugh hysterically while a person is torn apart.  In fact a number of people complained that there was not enough gore in Jurassic Park 3.  If you are looking for gore than you will get much more with this film than with JP3.  There was a more gritty tone with this film than with JP3. We got to see cows and other animals eaten alive in detail. But beyond the appeasement of those who need to be convinced of realism through gore and other methods, it is with action that Spielberg excels.  Fantastic use of sound and special effects make this film a thrilling event.  Spielberg has shown he is the king of action even on the small budget of Duel.  I was reminded of the terror invoked through the shaking of the ground and the loud sounds of a dinosaur walking.Jurassic Park was about terror and fear while JP3 was about adventure.  JP3 was a thrll ride in which the audience wishes it was on the island while Jurassic Park we were more in a state of fear.  JP3 was full of imagination and excitement and we really cared about the characters.  The smart kid in JP1 was more enjoyable than the crying kids in JP1.  Those who say he could not have survived because teenagers are dumb would probably be the same ones who at one time said women were unable to do anything.  Anyway JP3 was just an adventure that really found redeeming value in every character where JP1 just killed off all the creeps. I was also reminded that Jurassic Park was a statement movie.  The statement being that people should not clone creatures or try and create monsters similar to the ideas in Frankenstein.  JP3 was more like Dracula in that it had no real statement.  JP3 was really about whether or not the characters would escape with their son similar to whether or not one could survive a night in Dracula's castle.  So JP3 was more of a good old fashioned scary adventure and about imagination.  It really depends on what you like.  JP3 also was at a disadvantage being the second sequel but was still very exciting.  Personally, I give a slight edge to JP3 because I just enjoyed it more, though it definately could have been a little longer and would have been even better had Jeff Goldblum been in it.",

            "review": "Before giving me a thumbs down. Read at least what I have to say :)Luc Besson's Dracula is a visually arresting, emotionally charged, and hauntingly original take on the iconic legend. From the very first frame, it's clear that this is not just another vampire film-this is Besson in full command of his craft, blending gothic horror, art-house style, and deeply human storytelling into something truly unforgettable.The cinematography is stunning-moody shadows, rich textures, and bold color contrasts create a dreamlike atmosphere that pulls you into Dracula's cursed world. The pacing is masterful, slowly building tension while allowing the characters to breathe and evolve. And the music? A hypnotic blend of classical and modern that adds a visceral pulse to every scene.The performances are outstanding. The lead actor's portrayal of Dracula is both terrifying and tragic, capturing the eternal conflict between monstrous hunger and lost humanity. The supporting cast adds layers of depth, especially the heroine, whose chemistry with Dracula gives the film a beating heart.What sets this Dracula apart is its ambition. Besson doesn't just retell the story-he reimagines it, fusing romance, philosophy, and horror into a mythic, poetic experience. There are echoes of The Fifth Element in its stylization, but this is darker, more mature, and grounded in emotional truth.This is a Dracula for the 21st century-mysterious, seductive, and deeply cinematic. Highly recommended for fans of intelligent horror and visionary filmmaking.Verdict: A modern gothic masterpiece.",

The dialogues are a terrible combination of failed attempts at being profound about subjects like religion and love, and lots of stupid jokes and situations. The characters are just poorly written, they feel superficial and it's hard to empathize with any of them. The film is outright disrespectful of Stoker's work and of vampire folklore in general. It feels more like a caricature or a mockery of Coppola's version than an honest take on Stoker's book. There's even a dancing montage and CGI gargoyles reminiscent of Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The ambiance is just confusing, trying to be serious at times, but then cutting the tension with a stupid joke or goofy action. This confusion is clearly noticeable in Christoph Waltz's performance, who doesn't seem to be sure what to do and falls back at reenacting Dr. King Shultz. The protagonist has some decent moments, but spends half the time crying and mumbling like a mental patient, and half acting like a Parisian pimp. Nothing even remotely close to give presence and substance needed for such a heavy character. Don't waste your money on the theatre, wait until it comes out on a streaming platform, probably very soon, considering the quality.",

While the visuals are striking, they can't hide the film's self-indulgent pacing and lack of real scares. The story drags, weighed down by pretentious themes and melodramatic performances. Dracula himself is more mopey than menacing, and the supposed emotional depth feels forced. Strangely, the film borrows heavily in tone and aesthetic from Patrick Süskind's *Perfume*-the same obsessive atmosphere, the same brooding romanticism-but without the narrative clarity or psychological sharpness. Besson's ambition to \"reimagine\" the legend results in a film that's more style than substance.

            "review": "It takes real nerve to tackle Bram Stoker's most-filmed anti-hero in 2025. First, the role has already been immortalised by everyone from Bela Lugosi to Gary Oldman, so comparisons are savage. Second, gothic horror sits miles away from Luc Besson's usual playground of kinetic sci-fi (The Fifth Element) and neon crime capers (Léon). Walking in, I honestly wasn't sure whether we'd get an idiosyncratic triumph or a beautiful train wreck.Happily, it's closer to the former. Visually, the film is a feast: swirling Carpathian blizzards bleed into candle-lit castle corridors, while Besson's trademark flair for colour and movement gives the vampire myth a fresh, almost operatic sheen. The cast meet the challenge head-on-Dracula himself is equal parts seductively reptilian and heartbreakingly lonely, and the supporting ensemble never drops the ball. I found myself grinning at several sly nods to past adaptations yet never felt trapped in pastiche.Where the film stumbles is in the marrow of its story. The plot beats are solid but seldom surprising, and a mid-act detour about Dracula's centuries-old heartbreak lingers a few crimson drops too long. Trim twenty minutes, sharpen a couple of character arcs, and we might be talking instant classic. As it stands, Dracula is a very good film-bold, stylistically sumptuous, thoroughly entertaining-but not quite the genre-redefining masterpiece its ambition hints at.Verdict: 7.5 / 10. Worth the ticket for the imagery and performances alone; just don't expect it to eclipse Coppola's fang-print on the legend.",

            "review": "Dracula: A Love Tale is a new fantasy romance film directed, partially written, and produced by Luc Besson, known for The Fifth Element and Léon.After the death of his wife, Prince Vlad (Caleb Landry Jones) turns against the church and humanity. He transforms into the vampire Dracula, retreating to his castle.When Jonathan Harker (Ewens Abid) visits, Dracula learns about his wife Mina (Zoë Bleu), who bears a striking resemblance to the woman he once lost. He becomes obsessed with her and tries to win her over. This leads to an inner conflict: can the monstrous side of him make way for the more human Vlad so that he can experience love again?Luc Besson based this adaptation on Bram Stoker's Dracula, which has been filmed several times before. One of the most famous versions is Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) by Francis Ford Coppola. Last year, a new version of Nosferatu, directed by Robert Eggers, was also released. All these films essentially tell the same story of Dracula but emphasize different elements.While Bram Stoker's Dracula is mainly a gothic-romantic story with horror elements, Nosferatu focuses more on the horror aspect. Besson also opts for the romantic angle, but takes a lot of time with it. As a result, you follow a lost, aimless Dracula who only regains direction when he meets Mina. Until then, the film feels empty and slow, much like the character himself. This emptiness is filled with familiar scenes and elements from Stoker's book, but due to their repetition, they can seem meaningless and shallow.Though Besson places the romantic aspect at the center, he adds little new. At times, it even seems like he has removed or adjusted elements, possibly to make the film more suitable for a younger or teenage audience.The makeup effects are fitting and effective, but with other visual effects, the CGI is clearly noticeable.The cast delivers a solid performance but remains in the shadow of previous iconic portrayals of characters from the Dracula story, such as Gary Oldman, Bill Skarsgård, Anthony Hopkins, or Willem Dafoe.",

And he would be a great Joker in the style of Heath Ledger in the event of a prequel. A film with heart and soul made for the audience with an anti-hero who is hard to love, but can be understood, and can be sympathized with. I never liked Coppola's version of Bram Stocker's Dracula, and I really wanted someone to make a better version, but I really didn't expect that someone would be my favorite director from the great nineties (Nikita, Leon).

            "review": "Besson grabs hold of Dracula and tries to give it a romantic spin-think Romeo + Juliet drenched in hemoglobin. On paper, fine. On screen? It feels more like a Wattpad fanfic crossed with a Cartier commercial. The prince of darkness loses his wife, renounces God, and becomes a vampire... except instead of being a vicious, tormented predator, he spends the film whining like Anakin Skywalker every time he loses Padmé.Caleb Landry-Jones as Dracula is like casting Michel Drucker as Conan the Barbarian: it makes absolutely no damn sense. He's got the face of a guy selling metro tickets, not an unholy lord of the night. Christoph Waltz does his usual Waltz routine, but in \"Friday paycheck mode,\" while the actress playing Dracula's eternal love overacts so much you'd think she graduated from the Shia LaBeouf School of Overdoing It.Between the photo being tossed around like a soccer ball and the random gargoyles popping up with zero explanation, you can tell Besson dropped the pen after three coffees and finished the script freestyle, like a teenager on a Red Bull binge. At this point it's less a vampire's curse and more a Ubisoft glitch.To be fair, visually there are a few sparks. The horseback ride in the snow, the shots of a decrepit old Dracula-you can tell the cinematographer put in work. But copying Coppola with nice makeup is like cosplaying Darth Vader with a mask from Wish: it impresses for two seconds before everyone realizes it's reheated leftovers.The real issue? Dracula has zero darkness. The guy is supposed to embody sin, lust, the demonic... and here he's got all the charisma of a Twilight extra. Even Edward Cullen, sparkling like a disco ball, had more bite than this neutered immortal. Besson pulled off the impossible: he made Dracula boring.In the end, Dracula: A Love Tale is like a kebab without sauce: it looks appetizing, but leaves you unsatisfied. Besson wanted to reinvent the myth; he just watered it down. A few shots keep it from collapsing completely, but with a botched cast, grotesque inconsistencies, and a Dracula stripped of menace, the result reeks of roadkill.

The set design, costumes, and cinematography are beautiful. Only the gargoyles/goblins feel oddly out of place and not particularly well executed for a big-budget 2025 production.There are a few minor errors-such as modern toy balloons appearing at a 19th-century funfair-that are unfortunate and should have been avoided.

I expect this movie to spark a lot of debate, but I want to focus solely on the cinematic aspects, leaving politics aside.Let's start by talking about director Bong Joon-ho.He first caught my attention in 2000 with Barking Dogs Never Bite, a film that convinced me he was an outstanding filmmaker of that era.Then came Memories of Murder, a film based on real-life serial killings that sent shockwaves through the Korean film industry. This movie cemented his status as a commercially successful director in South Korea.Following that, he directed The Host, Mother, Snowpiercer, Netflix's Okja, and the Academy Award-winning Parasite, solidifying his global recognition as a filmmaker.Now, let's evaluate Mickey 17-without spoilers.This film intertwines modern political landscapes, human greed, desire, the ethical dilemmas brought on by scientific advancements, the philosophical implications of encountering extraterrestrial life, and even religious inquiries.It is a film that constantly challenges the viewer with profound questions, making you search for the essence of it all throughout its runtime.Honestly, watching a movie multiple times isn't always easy, but this is one that makes you want to revisit it and reflect on its themes again.Cautiously, I'd say this film has the potential to compete for an award at major film festivals.In particular, Robert Pattinson, the lead actor, may very well receive some form of recognition for his performance.It was an enjoyable film, and I highly recommend you watch it when it gets released.From a movie lover in Korea.",

Bong Joon Ho's thorough investigation of identity, duality, and the relationship between ego and power stick with you far after the film's credits roll. We all have fragmented personalities; various versions of ourselves. Some of these \"characters\" are consistently active and in rotation while others lay dormant, hidden deep beneath. Unless you're a complete sociopath, you have an empathic, emotional piece of your personality fostered in feelings of both love and fear. However, it's constantly at war with the carelessness, confidence, and bravery we all paradoxically have the potential for.Classically personified by symbolic imagery of an angel on one shoulder and a devious demon on the other, the moral and spiritual duality of man is a tale old as time... Yet, Joon Ho and Robert Pattison's lovable, highly animated Mickey Barnes breathe new life into the classic concept. The film's as unrealistic and ridiculous as it is refreshing and surprisingly relatable. Pattison's seemingly endless range and raw acting ability are on full display, perhaps more than ever. Not to mention, his natural charm in the role makes for a hell of a good time for audience members willing to give theirselves up to the cynicism and obvious outrageousness of it all.Joon Ho swings for the fences with his first fully-English feature, while Pattison's performance puts to rest any allegations left he can only play characters in the vein of Twilight's eerie Edward. On the other end, Mark Ruffalo's characterization of the relentlessly greedy and hilariously obnoxious Kenneth Marshall feels as fragmented and frantically scattered (in both its execution and inspiration) as Mickey's rich spirit and diverse personality traits throughout the course of the insanely inhumane scientific investigation he so desperately (and naively) agrees to take part in during the film's effective exposition. Despite this singular flaw, the picture is perfect from top to bottom, nothing new for the work of the Oscar-winning director. We all have our own Mickey-17s and -18s within. Now, much like moral Mickey, I'll find myself asking... \"What would eighteen do?\"",

What does it say about cloning? About colonization? It touches these subjects, sure, but it's so shallow.Robert Pattinson is fine but I think he's wasted in this. All the different versions of Mickey are also supposed to have different personalities but aside from 17 and 18 (as seen in the trailer) the previous 16 all act the same, even though the movie says that have different characteristics. But even that doesn't matter because we never get to see all the different Mickeys aside from a quick montage.Also, let me say that the use of narration in this movie is egregious. It doesn't enhance the experience, it's just filler to cover the silence.Finally, it's so boring! Boring visuals, boring sci-fi elements, boring creature designs, no unique aesthetic, no nothing.",

However, this sci-fi offering, based on Edward Ashton's novel Mickey7, ultimately falls short, bogged down by superficial explorations of complex themes and a frustrating lack of cinematic storytelling.The film's initial setup, depicting a near-future reality of dehumanization and casual cruelty, feels intentionally off-putting. While this world-building aims for a visceral impact, it quickly becomes tiresome. The narrative then shifts into a series of lengthy speeches, where the film's supposed ideas about colonization, human identity, governance, and corruption are laid bare in a manner akin to amateur middle-school debates. This reliance on dialogue rather than visual storytelling significantly weakens the film's impact.Robert Pattinson, a talented actor, is unfortunately underutilized. While his performance is solid, it lacks the space to truly shine. Mark Ruffalo, on the other hand, comes across as pretentious and artificial, his presence more annoying than engaging. The female characters are relegated to mere mannequins, their potential completely wasted.The central conflict between human personality and technological advancement concludes with a simplistic, Luddite-esque resolution, offering no genuine exploration or insight. Similarly, the secondary theme of colonization is reduced to a simplistic good-versus-evil narrative, flattening the complexities of the issue.Mickey 17 ultimately suffers from a pervasive superficiality. It raises intriguing questions but fails to provide meaningful answers or even stimulate productive discussion. While fans of Korean cinema and Robert Pattinson may feel compelled to see it, others can safely skip this one.",

Pattinson's weird voice was very distracting and they reduced him to a mushy-brained fool. It took all my patience to not walk out, but we suffered through to the end.

            "review": "Let's start with the obvious-while \"Mickey 17\" offers plenty of social commentary, it falls short of the sharp satire and intelligent (class) critique that made \"Parasite\" a modern masterpiece. Instead, what we get is a sci-fi parody that explores humanity's vanity and self-destruction, yet for some reason, it never truly feels like it takes place in a distant future.***\nRobert Pattinson delivers another strong performance, continuing his streak of unique and compelling roles. He has successfully reshaped his career, moving far beyond his early days, and frankly, we prefer him this way. His unexpected comedic side is a revelation, adding a fresh layer to his performance. Mark Ruffalo also shines, delivering a performance reminiscent of his role in Poor Things, with certain expressions and mannerisms subtly evoking Trump.***\nThe production is undeniably grand and expensive, evident in its visually striking yet occasionally excessive scenes. The film often gives off a sense of familiarity-as if we've seen these themes before. The idea for example that we are the real aliens and \"monsters\" is hardly new, and at times, the script leans too heavily on familiar concepts explored already by many movies.***\nWhile Mickey 17 is a solid film, it's far from a masterpiece. Perhaps the biggest challenge is that Bong Joon-ho has set the bar so high that anything less than exceptional feels like a slight let-down. There's a lingering sense that something is missing-a sharper edge, a deeper impact, or a more innovative twist.",

And he's always great in the role of all Mickey's.The supporting cast are fine except for in my opinion a terrible character in Mark Ruffalo's Kenneth Mars and yes I know what he was going for. It's just pretty bad.The story isn't bad, it's decent enough for a sci fi movie. But it doesn't nail any political or social matters like Parasite or Okja, both of which are absolutely brilliant films.And therefore a straight sci fi actioner could've been better here.Although admittedly there's some pretty funny moments.I sound disappointed which is probably the right emotion. I was expecting something really good but this had too much of Okja and Snowpiercer type action and acting to be unique.I don't want Bong Joon-Ho to become a parody of himself like Wes Anderson. I believe he's capable of much more.I have absolutely loved all of his past efforts even Barking Dogs Never Bite, which I think is hilarious.So that's 3 American made movies all very similar in tone. Definitely time for something more.Anyway it's worth a watch but this is not a classic.",

He's too passive to succeed. Meanwhile, the black female lead is the smartest person in the film-the savior (of course). The more aggressive and dominant version of him is also the one she's attracted to. Mark Ruffalo plays a ridiculous authority figure clearly meant to be a stand-in for Trump, warning us about the dangers of his leadership. Earth's future is bleak, corporations are destroying the planet, and humanity is forced to flee into space to survive. The \"aliens\" we encounter are harmless, but we treat them as a threat, stealing their land while pretending they're dangerous. And most importantly, the expendable working-class clones bear the brunt of society's suffering so that the privileged can thrive.Did I get all that right?This film is beyond horrible. The characters are so exaggerated that they barely function as actual people, instead serving as thinly veiled political mouthpieces. The messaging is as subtle as a brick to the face-about as much of a \"farce\" as Borat, except it pretends to be deep and thought-provoking instead of just saying the quiet part out loud. It's the worst kind of midwit storytelling-simultaneously acting like it's making some clever, subtle commentary while actually being as blunt and obvious as possible. It's like the film wants you to believe it's being cryptic and intellectual when it's really just screaming the most surface-level takes imaginable.And of course, this kind of left-leaning, hyper-contrived narrative gets praised, even though it presents a completely one-sided perspective, ignoring any middle ground.The most frustrating part is the bait-and-switch. The trailer sells this as a fun sci-fi adventure, but the actual film is just another over-the-top political lecture disguised as entertainment. Nobody goes to the movies to be force-fed a message they already get nonstop from the news. If you're going to be this overt, at least have the balls to be upfront about it.And then there's Mark Ruffalo-easily the worst part of the whole thing. He plays the same delusional, self-righteous clown that he is in real life, blindly clinging to every cause he doesn't understand. His entire presence in this film is unbearable.I think this film is exactly why Hollywood gets derided and why the theater industry is dying. Why do we need to be tricked into this kind of nonsense? This is the reason superhero shlock dominates the box office-because adults don't want to be ambushed with a lecture and are losing faith in movies thanks to the constant barrage of left-leaning pandering.

After watching a film like Parasite, which was very well done, this was rather tame. I think part of it is the narration and the other part was the writing. Acting wise I think everyone did a fine job, there were themes that were put out there that didn't quite hit or didn't really matter as the story unfolds, and while I could sympathize with the characters and the situations, the actions and consequences of them didn't carry much weight.This didn't seem to be set up for a sequel and probably for the best, but I'd be curious to see if a part 2 would have more to offer.

Pete Davidson is not one of these people. There needs to be immense skill and a sense of focus that turns a loveable character actor into a terror and sadly we're treated to lots of close ups of Pete's face looking blank, bored, confused, constipated and spaced out rather than the tumult of emotions he needs to express.His line delivery is wooden and unemotional and I got the impression of Billy the puppets from Saw and Dead Silence.This weak performance is highlighted in every scene when he is opposite an established actor such as John Glover, Ethan Phillips, Bruce Altman & Mary Beth Peil, which is almost every scene. They are effortless and embody their characters, believe what they are saying, no matter how ridiculous, and sell their lines with a mixture of talent, experience and craft that is the most fun parts of this movie.Sadly, all their characters exist only to move Pete's character through the plot and to be honest, the plot is a bit of a mess.A huge part of the horror is that old people are gross, illness is gross and old sick people are very gross and weird and crazy. Yawn.There's a big reveal that comes about two thirds of the way through for no reason other than to get us to the end of the film, the established plot is discarded with a handwave and we move on to Plot B.The final act would be fun if it didn't feel that it had been lifted poorly from The Substance and the resolution for two characters is literally random.I wasn't expecting much, given Pete Davidson's awful turn in Bodies, Bodies, Bodies and James DeMonaco's decrease in quality of The Purge films and I somehow still walked away disappointed.If you enjoy horror movies, skip this one. There's nothing new, nothing inventive and the most interesting performances total up to probably about ten minutes of the 95m runtime and having to stare at Pete's blank face while he plays a character better suited to an actor ten years younger that can modulate their voice at all is not worth the waste of 85m.",

            "review": "It turns out the scariest place to work isn't a haunted house or an abandoned asylum... it's a retirement home. James DeMonaco's The Home proves just that, delivering a slow-burn psychological horror experience that builds dread with every creaking hallway, awkward stare, and cryptic bedtime story told after dark. It's moody, gripping, and ultimately, unshakable, a horror film that knows how to get under your skin without resorting to cheap thrills.Pete Davidson shines. Ever since Bodies Bodies Bodies, he's been quietly redefining what kind of roles he can handle, and The Home might be his best work yet. He plays Max, a troubled man sent to work at a retirement facility as part of a community service sentence. Max is sarcastic and detached, but there's pain behind his eyes, and Davidson walks the line between dark comedy and genuine fear with surprising skill. His performance feels grounded, especially as the story spirals into madness.The setup could've been generic... \"guy works in creepy place, spooky stuff happens\" but DeMonaco, best known for The Purge series, infuses the film with a claustrophobic sense of paranoia. You can feel the walls closing in around Max as the residents' cryptic comments grow weirder and the staff becomes increasingly suspicious. And unlike 2023's The Rule of Jenny Pen (a retirement home horror film that dragged like it had arthritis), The Home knows how to pace itself. Every chapter pushes the mystery forward, no filler, no wheel-spinning, just a steady build toward something chilling and earned.The supporting cast is a huge asset. John Glover, as a disturbingly charming resident, delivers a performance that's as enigmatic as it is unnerving. Bruce Altman adds quiet menace as one of the staff, the kind of guy who's always just too helpful. The film doesn't go for over-the-top monsters or gore, this is a psychological horror that plays in the shadows, thriving on uncertainty, whispers, and the ever-present fear that Max might be losing his grip on reality.Visually, the film is drenched in muted tones and sickly yellows, echoing the sterile, fading world of the retirement home. Dream sequences bleed into reality so fluidly you start to question what's real right alongside Max. The sound design adds to the tension: distant cries, shuffling footsteps at night, the hum of fluorescent lights that feel like they're watching you.The Home is a taut, eerie, and emotionally charged psychological horror film that doesn't just entertain-it lingers. Pete Davidson continues to prove his range, and James DeMonaco crafts a story that's rich with atmosphere and tension. This might be one of the year's biggest surprises, and easily one of the strongest horror entries of 2025 so far.",

That is so far from the case here.That was the happiest happy ending I've watched in sometime, and I was smiling very hard by the time the credits rolled. I was very vocal in my wtf!?! That I boisterously exclaimed as the movie plowed on. It starts out slow, I guess. It isn't as slow start as I'm used to seeing when people say that. It is only a matter of minutes, because the writing of the characters and the way the story is told with the cinematography, it really had me hooked like a tow truck. It doesn't take long for the crazy to start creeping in. By the time you've noticed the overt you might have a little time to think back on things and see the way it's been creeping on ya all along. It really is that good and one of the strongest newer horror movies released this year and much of last. I was last surprised by Dead Mail, and I loved it, but this definitely takes the cake for unexpected surprised enjoyment. I also feel it's great to have someone to watch it with because as the stuff starts to spiral, it's fun to hear the reactions.",

It's heartfelt, beautifully made, and captures the spirit of the original while adding just the right amount of freshness.This is the kind of remake we actually want-one made with care, love, and deep respect for the source material. The emotional themes about family, love, and belonging are still front and center, and they hit just as hard today as they did years ago. Lilo's story is just as touching, Stitch is just as chaotic and adorable, and the message of \"ohana\" still resonates powerfully.Visually, the movie is stunning. The Hawaiian setting feels authentic and vibrant, and the design of Stitch and the other alien characters blends surprisingly well with the real-world elements. It never feels forced or overly modernized. The music also keeps that nostalgic charm with new energy.I could tell the creators worked hard on this. It's not a cash grab-it's a genuine love letter to fans old and new. Whether you've seen the original or not, this remake stands tall on its own.This is probably the best Disney remake so far. 10/10. It's emotional, entertaining, and full of heart. A true example of how remakes should be.",

One of my favorite Disney films of all time. I have stitch paintings on my walls in my home.That being said. I don't know what all the negative reviewers are crying about. After watching this and reading the reviews. I Start to wonder is Snow White was all that bad? I skipped it BECAUSE of the reviews. But the reviews on this film are ridiculous. The movie was wonderful.Did they change things? YES People are always shocked by that as if they expected the new movie to be a shot for shot, word for word copy of the first film. If you want that.l just watch the original!Of COURSE things will be changed. If you are not comfortable with that concept. Don't watch remakes. And don't complain about it when you do.The changes made aren't even that bad. Yes the main villain isn't in it. Ubuntu. But hey. I get it. Kinda hard to fit a 15 foot tall hammerhead shark man into a real life setting and still have it somewhat grounded. Ok.Pleakley and Jumba are in a \"human form\" as opposed to being in disguise. This was done to save on budget. Whatever.They added some more to Lilo and Nanis story. Some back story. Fleshed it out a little. But the heart of it is still there. It hits all the same notes. The feelings are there. The meaning of Ohana. It'll make you laugh and tug at your heart. Just like the original. The little actress who played Lilo is adorable. She does an amazing job. Stitch is still a menacing little deviant with his character arc in fact. Albeit, without the duck book which seemed to make a lot of the reviewers mad as well.Just. Go see it. Unless you're as stuck up as some of these other reviewers you'll enjoy it like my daughter and I did. Don't listen to people. People don't let people enjoy things these days.It was great.",

But it was not.Just as heartwarming and moving as the original Lilo&Stitch from 2002; this one had very few slight changes to the script. Yet it felt new. The theme of family, belonging and acceptance thankfully has been well preserved and translated the way no other Disney production probably has.Maia Kealoha did a good job portraying Lilo, but for me the best addition to this Ohana was Sydney Agudong who played Nani. She was so believable, so sisterly, she carried every single one of her scenes perfectly.For those who complained about Pleakley's live action adaptation after seeing the trailer, I think you will enjoy his character in this version. Not to the full extent of the original but Billy Magnussen totally delivers what was asked of him.Another great surprise was bringing the original voice of Nani - Tia Carrere - to partake in the live action (in a different role of course), it was nostalgic seeing her on the big screen again and hearing her voice.I didn't expect to get as emotional as I did watching this version as an adult, but the grief, chances as redemption and the idea that even the most flawed of us deserve love hits at any age I guess.Still to this day one of Disney's more unconventional and emotionally resonant stories, especially for its honest portrayal of family struggles and the strength of sibling bonds. And I know the new generation will fall in love with these characters just like we did 23 years ago. Luckily the run was kept under 2 hours long so nobody will have a chance to complain.",

            "review": "Lilo & Stitch suffers from all the usual problems that make these Disney live action remakes so much worse than the animated originals they attempt to adapt. The film is noticeably longer for no reason thanks to its unnecessary need to add new characters who bring nothing and almost all of its changes do more damage than good. However, it mostly retains the heart of its predecessor and still contains some good laughs so it can comfortably avoid being the worst remake.Maia Kealoha is a suitably adorable Lilo and Chris Sanders is obviously a great Stitch, who remains the best part. Sydney Agudong is a good Nani but pretty much everyone else is so bland and Courtney B. Vance's Cobra Bubbles is especially screwed over by the changes to his character. Zach Galifianakis & Billy Magnussen as Jumba & Pleakley are a colossal step down in comparison to the original duo and their alien forms are now extremely uncanny.Dean Fleischer Camp's direction gets the job done in the standard issue authorless fashion. All the technical issues stem from the near total lack of energy which comes from the misguided idea to (kinda) faithfully adapt a film that wasn't even remotely made with live action sensibilities in mind. The uniqueness has gone and it's replaced by something that generally feels a lot more generic. At least the CGI for Stitch is good enough because it would've been unwatchable if it wasn't.",

Iconic moments from the animated version are lovingly recreated, while new scenes add depth and emotional resonance. The soundtrack is a delightful blend of classic and new music, enhancing every scene with warmth and energy.More than just a family film, Lilo & Stitch (2025) is a touching story about love, loss, and the meaning of 'ohana - family.

They completely lost the heart of the story. The original was about found family, feeling like an outsider, and growing into love and understanding. This version just kind of glosses over all that. They cut out some important characters who brought depth, and the new ones they added didn't move the plot forward at all-they felt like filler.And then there's Lilo. In the original, her behavior came from trauma, misunderstanding, or just being a kid who felt deeply and didn't know how to express it. Here, it feels like they made her act out just to be bad. It wasn't quirky or endearing-it was out of character and kind of mean-spirited.What really stings is the lack of emotional growth. The original gave us real redemption arcs and character development. Here, it's like everyone stays the same the whole movie. No payoff, no evolution.Visually it's fine, and I'm sure some people might enjoy it on a surface level. But for fans who connected with the original's heart? This just feels hollow.",

Well, it turns out that was a blessing in disguise when Warner Bros. Booked him for a slot of this movie and months later, he was reemployed by the giant-sized company for GOTG 3 and he just killed two heroes with one stone. 2021's The Suicide Squad is indeed, THE Suicide Squad that we all deserve!The most outstanding thing about this latest squad is the way they blend and mix in everything into the recipe. It's like you're watching a bunch of genres; comedy, dark comedy, fantasy, action, thriller, drama, superhero, spoof and commentaries; political, social contexts, world revolving issues all together and yet, it tastes très bon! Often enough, movies that try to do everything together fail big time but not this one. This is a cinematic achievement.James Gunn, who also directed Guardians of the Galaxy, knew that the Marvel/DC films have rehashed their materials multiple times; basic origin, romance, giving up, final battle. Hence, Gunn develops a non-formulaic approach that seems suicidal at first but triumphantly creates something unique and unpredictable. From the get-go, Gunn's vision is unconventional but polished, enough to make the audience feels they have never seen anything like it before.Talking about unpredictability, it indeed is what it is. You never know what will come next, who will die or survive. There are a few times that Gunn uses the head fake technique to deceive viewers from its sequential but engaging storytelling. Like Deadpool, something unexpected happens at the moment when you least expect it.The juxtaposition of both the 2016's and 2021's is evidently visible. While 2016 has its moments, almost everyone could agree it was disappointingly bland af. The 2021 entry has a strong direction and far better pacing, let alone twists that are fully captivating. The only couple of things that 2016 did it better were the trailers and the soundtrack.The Rated-R is straight up hardcore to the face. It's superbly gory, darkly comical and unabashedly funny, all without pulling its punches. This is how DC films should be, not as dour as Zack Snyder's but not as light as Marvel's either.When it comes to flaws, albeit its powerful opening scene, I feel that they waste many of the potential characters here insofar some of them never even got the chance to show their abilities, skills, talents or superpowers.I am also not impressed by the intensity of the movie's brightness particularly on the background in some scorching white scenes. It defaces the texture of the film and should dazzle some viewers, left distorting of what could have been an iconic scene like the slo-mo segment.All in all, 2021's The Suicide Squad makes for a suicidal task with flamboyantly sheer colourful characters that collectively sign up for one thing amidst this pandemic chaos; blasting out loud the volume of fun and violence, subsequently climbing to the top as the best DCEU Film ever made.",

No hate towards David Ayer, the studios definitely meddled with his film to the max, I would LOVE to see his version but nonetheless, what we got was such a terrible film.... Fast forward 5 years & Warner Brothers turns the tables and makes what is probably one of the GREATEST comic book movies of all time. The film is very ballsy, violent & full of heart. The characters are eye candy & I'm VERY happy that James Gunn kept what worked in the original. Because it was a bad movie but there were some good in it. This film James really respects David Ayers film by keeping what worked while just sticking to what needed to be done. The R Rating was needed, I'm also glad the studio acknowledged that. I'm VERY Tired of seeing studios go for a PG-13 rating so they can get more views. Like cmon now, grow a pair please. Sony doing it with Venom & all other types of examples of studios fearing the R Rating... I think ever since Joker Warner Brothers has discovered that they can really get the same numbers if not more regardless, Then Birds Of Prey happened, which I enjoyed too. BUT my point is ALL of this led up to this movie RIGHT HERE. So again, kudos to Warner Brothers for the R Rating!!! Now first things first, The action is GREAT & the twists are even more magnificent. The Comedy is SPOT ON, and lands when it needs to, the use of dark comedy and balance of character development is done so well that it doesn't feel out of place or that one is taking over the other. BloodSport carry's this movie, his performance was SCREAMING Will Smith for me, (meaning the role just looks like it was meant for him because he had daughter issues too) but I gotta say, Idris Elba grew on me more than Will Smith did. His performance is GREAT and he has amazing chemistry with another character and it just feels special. Polka Dot man was absolutely hilarious yet gave me a bittersweet taste in my mouth, but in a good way. King Shark was an amazing joy to watch on screen. Peacemaker was awesome too. Now what I mean by awesome is off their importance, performance and role in the movie. Some of these characters are not like able... mind you... and some things will happen over the course of events and make you not like characters more and that's where this movie shines. It's VERY unpredictable. And when you feel like you think you know where the movie is going it pulls the rug from under you hard. Very enjoyable ride. When it was over I wanted to watch it again.*Pros*\nWell written characters / performances\nComedy/Action (is not repetitive)\nEffects/CGI\nStory / plot / script*Cons*\nThinly written Villain\nClimax for the ending felt just a bit thin wish it would have required more \"teamwork\" and not one character being the reason they won (you'll see what I mean)\nSome Characters I felt died a bit too soon and would have liked a little more depth before they went.WB needs to keep this up and we will continue to want more. If they understand the character they should know the direction needed to continue the character. Superman doesn't need to be dark and suicide squad should never be PG13. Not saying these are \"impossible to do\" but just saying if you REALLY understand the character you should know what works and what doesn't, and as far as I see it... this is the RIGHT direction for The Suicide Squad Peacemaker show is something to look forward to! And I will be more than happy to call this Film an \"The REAL Academy Winning Suicide Squad\" because it deserves the title more than the 2016 one... #releasetheayercut.",

James Gunn struck gold with the first Guardians of the Galaxy, and the attempt to repeat that formula is apparent here - only it's amped up to the nth degree. The plot, if one can call it that, is one long exercise in subverting expectations. But Gunn is no M. Night Shymalan and no Monty Python either. This is pure randomness and lack of structure masquerading as subversiveness and edginess. I found myself reminded of the old Ren & Stimpy cartoon show at times, the bad later seasons, not the good early ones. Trying so hard to be edgy that it just becomes cringe worthy.This film reeks of studio desperation. It's Homer's makeup shotgun from the Simpsons in movie form. A bizarre, unfocused and pitiful smear of concepts, moods and sounds.Speaking of sound, the use of music in this film is awful. Different genres of songs are used randomly like in a late 90s Tarantino rip off. Most of the pop songs don't even work with what's happening on screen. Harley's escape is such a case. Frequently the score is interrupted full stop by sound fx or jokes. Again another attempt at \"subverting expectations\" and a simple trick at that. People expect music to go on, so when it's suddenly interrupted, they feel surprised. It's a dumb man's clever movie.It's not entirely without merit. Some of the photography is nice. Some of the acting performances are good (Polka Dot man, Idris Elba, the Shark and Rat Girl stand out) and some are awful (the villains, the nerds in front of the computer screens who do nothing but comment on things). Some of the character interactions are funny. Most are not.The first 20 minutes are amusing. The movie grinds to a painful halt in the middle and never regains its momentum. It's one exceedingly long, constantly interrupted, unfocused stew. Worst of all is the blatant disrespect this film has for its audience.I compare Marvel movies to fast food. Simple, safe, unhealthy junk food for the brain with very few nutrients. This is worse.

            "review": "Before I talk about the film, let me talk a bit about DCEU. The difference between DC and Marvel (and why Marvel is more successful than DC) is the people behind them. The people/company behind Marvel (Disney) know and plan everything. They even planned this whole MCU thing ever since 2008's Iron Man. They know what they are doing, where they are heading with their characters, stories, and films, and how to do them and write them right. That's why their Universe is more successful. But, for DC the people/company behind it (Warner Bros.) are ruining this beautiful universe that's filled with great characters by bringing the wrong people to direct/write their movies which brings chaos to the films and world of the DCEU. Or they create issues with the right director like Zack Snyder (which we all saw how he was building that big/creative universe in Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) and where it was going). However, this time DC choses James Gunn to write & direct this film which if you're not familiar with, he directed Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 (2014) and Vol. 2 (2017). And this is the second proof (after Snyder's) that when having the right person/people behind a film, they will kill it. And THIS IS HOW \"The SUICIDE SQUAD\" STORY SHOULD LOOK LIKE. And that's all thanks to James Gunn.So happy that the film got an R rating because the suicide squad story should be like that. It should be full of blood, comedy, craziness, violence, disgusting action scenes, and curse words. Thank god they didn't care about the film being PG 13+ or whatever so more people could see it. And I feel like James Gunn was behind that part. It's not a suicide squad film if there were no sexual, bloody, violent, and disgusting content.The cinematography was beyond amazing and the film presented some new ideas. Like, in one scene (dw no spoilers) two characters were fighting and we were seeing it through the reflection of a helmet. Or in a specific fight scene, instead of \"blood\" coming out of the bodies, it was \"flowers\" which made the 3 or 5 min action sequence very colorful and fun to watch. The camera movements were also great and felt that they sometimes were steady handheld which was so unique. Also loved how the film picks slow motion in certain times only to show the chaos that's happening around and they were very limited which is a good thing.For the third time, Margot Robbie proves that she is the best portrayal of Harley Quinn and I cannot imagine anyone other than her as Harley Quinn. She presents the beauty, craziness, and wildness of the character. Idris Alba really surprised me. His character was very well written and Idris played it so right. The real surprise was John Cena. Personally, I don't like Cena's acting. But, in this film his acting was alright and the thing that helped him is how good his character (Peacemaker) is written. Especially that Peacemaker has a huge impact on the story of the film and the future of DCEU. Daniela Melchior gave the film such a warm/soft vibe and her acting was well done especially in the emotional scenes. The whole cast was just amazing and each actor/actress played their role perfectly.Really loved the music in the film. And if you have seen Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) you'd know that it has the same style/vibe. The costumes were brilliant and loved how James kept the original costume of each character from the comics which made the film/character even more special & real. Also, loved how the film jumps back in time suddenly to explain where a specific character is or how things ended up that way and there was something different about it which I can't tell what it is.My rating is 8/10\nWATCHED: in an IMAX Theatre.",

            "review": "While James Gunn was excellent in directing Guardians 1 & 2, I feel he missed the mark with this one. It seems that this movie struggled with the genre it belonged to and the issues with David Ayer's version were actually exacerbated in this. I do think it was very well shot and it was creative, however, I think the writing was a let down. The humour did not work in this film, the jokes fell flat and they did not have the intended effect which is why it feels like a film struck between two genres. It would be best described as an action comedy, however, considering the comedic aspect of the film failed, what we were left with was a mediocre action film. What made Guardians successful was the ability to combine the humour and the action in an organic way but it seems that James Gunn failed in this movie to do that.The characters were written quite well and they were likeable which was one aspect that I enjoyed and they had their own identity which shined through. The characters were not forgettable like in 2016 and it did make the film bearable. The plot itself was quite generic and it felt that nothing was at stake. While this is perhaps the intent, it did not make the audience care much for what was going on.I do think the subplot of Luna was both bizzare and unnecessary. It added nothing of value, neither in the story nor character development. Perhaps it did add a bit for Harley but it felt very out of place.The background of a corrupt south American regime did seem too heavy and it felt like it was shoehorned in by the US government to reinforce how being against the US government is evil and those who oppose the US foreign policy are malicious people with ulterior motives.Once all these elements are combined, it really is quite an incoherent film. The humour and action do not fit together organically, the jokes fall flat, the idea of a corrupt regime did not fit well with the genre, it was like combining two different films, nothing felt at stake, and the way the villain was defeated felt childish and odd.It's mediocre in my opinion. Not a lot more than that.",

She is to Harley what Heath Ledger was to the joker. The movie is filled with funny one liners and never takes itself too seriously. I felt the first Suicide Squad was bordering too much pretty humour and seriousness and wasn't sure what it was. This reboot blends humour and seriousness perfectly.

I say \"near\" real time because the drive is only 40 minutes and yet surely takes up longer in the movie as it's ~80%+ of the runtime.The problem for me is that this felt like a cheap episode of a TV drama that would be shown on ITV. The parents were annoying, particularly the father and the car setting began to get tedious, especially every time the sat-nav told the audience how far we had to go. For some this will rachet up tension and desperation to get there quicker, but for me the journey felt like a slow crawl.For me the ending left much to be desired. An earlier throwaway line about how the parents \"will never find resolution\" felt like expectations management from the director - when I heard this I prepared for the worst and was still disappointed. Another cop out ending in a critically acclaimed indie movie? Surely not?!The second twist is revealed when the lights come up, but this one itself was largely guessable if you were paying attention - but even if you weren't, spelling it out in this fashion felt like an odd bolt-on to the movie. It would have benefitted from being included in the film and not the credits.Overall Hallow Road is a largely tepid, slightly creepy story of parents rushing to the aid of the child but I now grow weary of so many indie films choosing to use amibiguity as a means to add weight to their story.

Director Babak Anvari (\"I Came By\") delivers a very intense and compelling thriller here, even though the story largely takes place in one enclosed location (a car) and has only two main characters (and also a few voices over the phone).The concept is simple, but that makes it even more efficient. In the middle of the night, parents Maddie and Franck receive a panicky phone call from their teenage daughter Alice. She caused an accident with her father's car. The car is stuck and damaged, but - much worse - there is another girl lying motionless on the road. The parents jump in the car and stay in touch with Alice, but during the long journey the problems pile up. Is the girl who was hit by a car still alive? Where is the ambulance? Why did Alice drive to such a remote place? Was she sober? Will this incident destroy the rest of her life?There are 2 main reasons why \"Hallow Road\" is the most haunting and unforgettable thriller you will see this year (and perhaps also in the coming years). First and foremost because it is - simply - a realistic scenario. The chance this horror will happen to yourself, or someone close to you, is much greater than, say, moving into a haunted house or having to fight werewolves and zombies. You read about hit-and-run accidents almost daily, and behind each of these incidents is a tragic story for both sides. Secondly, because Matthew Rhys and - especially - Rosamund Pike give away such incredibly strong performances. Director Anvari felt that the story couldn't just end like a random news fact, and so there are some weird twists in the script towards the end. Still very absorbing, though. The ending is completely open to interpretation, and that too is the best they could have done. Powerful film, recommended!",

Together, they balance parental instinct with quiet dread, delivering performances that emotionally anchor the film.When Alice calls her mother in a panic-having hit and killed a girl on the remote Hallow Road in the fictional town of Ashfolk-it sets off a psychological mystery told almost entirely through a phone call and in-car dialogue.The cinematography is cloaked in shadow, using the night not just as a setting, but as a symbol of the unknown-where every frame hums with mystery, suppressed fear, and the creeping sense that something is just out of sight.As a viewer, you're confined with the parents-just their car, a phone, and Alice's disembodied voice guiding you through a spiral of guilt, fear, and confusion.The film explores how language can disturb more deeply than imagery, and how those we trust most can become sources of dread.\"Hallow Road\" is a haunting meditation on parenting, moral ambiguity, and the fragile boundary between safety and threat.It's the kind of horror that doesn't scream-it lingers, whispering long after the screen fades to black.",

Mum (a paramedic) and Dad drive the 40 something miles to find her. Most of the movie consists of Alice talking on the 'phone to her parents in their vehicle and their drive is in real time, quite an interesting idea though it will not please everyone, no doubt some viewers will find it boring. The good performances and the urgency of the family's plight do help keep the movie together. This is a film that you could follow with your eyes closed for the bulk of the running time. And it also proves that suggested horror can be far more scary than actually seeing it. Hallow Road is a creepy and unnerving journey. However, it is not all good. For a start I found the ending a bit disappointing, I had hoped for more. Also the film is set in England/The UK, the road markings aren't British, the car's Satnav reads in miles but its speedometer is in KM/H (it was filmed in Ireland and the Czech Republic). And it is obvious that the vehicle isn't always moving when it is meant to be (bear in mind most of the plot takes place in the car).

With only the intensity of their car as the scenario as this all takes place via the telephone, and what I must admit was probably the slowest and/or safest driving to the site of an accident I've ever witnessed on film (or anywhere else, for that matter) we are introduced to a couple with demons galore and a somewhat confused sense of the ridiculous and of their own priorities. It's that very superficiality and flakiness that makes this a bit more potent than your average thriller and at times it has a characterful intensity akin to a late night radio play with limited visuals and audio: just two people and an increasingly effective and frenzied script. Rhys tends to overact a bit but Pike and the gripping pace of the film deliver something that asks what we might do for our kids, but in a much less typical and frankly more pragmatic fashion.

The pair race to the scene, keeping in touch on speaker phone, but as they do, tensions erupt between the couple, before things take a sinister turn.For those not lulled in by the big new Mission: Impossible film, this little (virtually un) publicised film might be a decent distraction. After checking the running time, it becomes quickly evident that it's another addition from the 'real time' staple (with events playing out exactly as they occur with no cuts) , the last I can remember being Paul Andrew Williams's 2010 effort Cherry Tree Lane.In a film with pretty much only two cast members, Pike and Rhys play well off each other, and develop an effective chemistry as a couple with conflicting approaches and attitudes towards their daughter, and what may have led to and how to resolve her current predicament. Likewise, McDonnell does well in a voiceover role, descending further into distress and disbelief while her happy, carefree profile picture stares back at us. It's all genuinely compelling and inspired , until an unwelcome supernatural element is added to the story that detracts from the realism of the events. Indeed, it's at this late point that we suddenly learn the film is set at Halloween (which may have been foreshadowed by the Hallow in the title.)It remains genuinely suspenseful until the end, which comes in not the most comprehensible fashion, with matters feeling unresolved.

Plus this movie knows suspense, I tell you, I almost threw a water bottle at the screen from sheer terror once the scare finally happened. There are no fake jump scares, the movie earned an R rating without any blood, sex, or profanity, it's all from the terror that this movie builds upon.Not only is the movie scary, but as a film itself, it's almost a masterpiece. The script, acting, direction, style, tone, etc were all simply top notch. Wan's camera-work here is by far his best out of any of his movies. The choice to set the movie in the 70s was a stroke of genius as it feels so authentic and all the more real. If this story were set in the present, it simply wouldn't be as a effective or scary. The 70s style film making, costuming, and hair styling are a great throwback to likes of The Exorcist & The Amityville Horror.Though there are a few (extremely minor) flaws, such are length, repetitiveness, and a resolution that happens way too fast. I don't care, every horror movie (or movie in general) has it's flaws. There will never be a perfect horror movie, if there is one, I haven't seen it yet. But all I know is James Wan's The Conjuring is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time, and it's been a really long time that a movie has scared me this badly.10/10 Don't miss this one, it's an amazing theater viewing experience.",

            "review": "\"Don't summon the devil, don't call the priest ...\"I was one of a lucky few to have seen The Conjuring at a preview screening for FrightFest 2013.I went in totally cold, not having seen a trailer, nor knowing anything about the story or plot and it turned out to be one of the best scary horror movies I have ever seen.The Conjuring is a nail-biting, hiding-behind-hands movie. If you've been disappointed with the likes of Paranormal Acivity and Insidious, this one is likely to deliver in areas where they failed.It tells the supposedly true story of two paranormal investigators, who aim to rid families and properties of their suspected supernatural visitations, either by disproving them (if they turn out to be just creaky floorboards or slamming doors) or tackling them head-on if not. A leap of faith is required to buy into this theme but if you're okay with it, then the movies plays out pretty well within its genre confines.The particular incident they are brought in to deal with is described as surrounding a spirit 'so malevolent' it was hidden from the public until only now. In fairly Amityville-like circumstances, a family move into a new house and discover the basement is sealed; boarded-up behind a doorway.It's not at all surprising what follows, once they decide to take a look in the basement but it is surprising how James Wan has managed to take such a tired theme of haunting and possession and revive it so convincingly.I am no stranger to these kind of movies but this one truly tops them all for tension and terror. I really enjoyed Sinister recently, which I found to be equally as scary but it lost its way a bit towards the end, whereas The Conjuring keeps tempo and has a fairly satisfying conclusion.I particularly liked the way the film took a turn for the comical somewhere in the middle, only for perhaps five minutes, then came back firing on all cylinders as it headed to the finale. If this was intentional, to lure us into a false sense of security, it worked beautifully.If you're the type to poo-poo this genre in general, I can't see you suddenly being converted to a believer but, if you enjoy classic horror like The Exorcist, The Amityville Horror and Poltergeist, I can almost guarantee The Conjuring won't disappoint.",

            "review": "I got a chance to see this movie at the film festival, and boy was I TERRifically surprised! James Wan's 'The Conjuring' is one of those rare gems in the horror industry that finds a spot beside the classic titles of horror, 'The Shining', 'Poltergeist', and 'The Exorcist' due to James Wan's ability to balance an atmospheric dreadful tale involving wonderfully crafted characters with a haunted house that had my palms sweating and my heart pounding during some of the most horrifying moments (There are a few of those; make sure you empty your bladder BEFORE entering the theater).The things that make 'The Shining', 'Poltergeist', and 'The Exorcist' good is that if the editor were to chop out all the jump-scares and those sequences that fry an image into your brain, you would still have a moody, edgy story that makes you sympathies for the characters and their struggle. This is what Wan does right in this film, and it's then that you realize horror is more than what pops out at you, or what makes you scream. Rather, it's that feeling of dread you get that escalates into sheer terror and suspense, aided by shocking scares.BUT WAIT! All this not to say 'The Conjuring' doesn't have its share of frightening visuals and pee-your-pants moments; believe me when I say I also rank this as one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Yet, Wan realizes here that jump scares aren't what moves a story along, but what defines that classic image everyone gets in their head when someone talks about a certain horror movie that frightened them the most, kind of like a celebrity's autograph in the corner of a huge poster of their face.All of this hence to say, \"The Conjuring\" is an exceptional piece of film that pulls all the right stops to frighten the audience, leaving a lasting impression on your mind as well the recently tired genre of horror.Movie Score: 10/10!",

            "review": "\"The Conjuring\" is a high class horror film, its hard not to be scared by it, we care for the characters and the story is compelling enough to make you feel interested the whole time.Based on true life events, Ed and Lorraine Warren are paranormal investigators set to help a family terrorized by a demon, said to be one of the most terrifying cases of their lives which they hadn't shared with anyone...until now.First of all, I loved that it takes place in the 70's, I agree completely with director James Wan's point of view that it is almost impossible to make a horror film set in the present. For example, the teenage daughters of the haunted family would be taking pictures of the demons with their iphones and would be posting them on posting them on instagram, basically the demons would turn into the victims and the humans would be the bad guys.The movie isn't perfect though, there are a few plot holes in it, but still it does have some great scares in it that had me jumping out my seat and I liked the way it builds up tension and lets us know the characters before it starts with all the craziness. Not only is the movie set in the 70's, but it also has the feel of a 70's horror film, with slow zooms and filming styles you wouldn't expect from a modern movie. I really believe James Wan has outdone himself with this movie, I'll even go so far to calling it the scariest movie I've seen in my life. Thank you James Wan for this great movie and good luck with Fast & Furious 7.I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great horror film, I guess it gives the feeling audiences must have felt when watching \"The Exorcist\", \"Don't Look Now\", or Poltergeist\" for the first time.",

            "review": "Like comedy, the horror genre can be a very subjective beast, finding or missing its mark as much do to its craft and execution as it does the particular individual who plops themselves into a theater seat. If something isn't scary to someone – someone who earnestly believes that of course – then a fright flick has failed at its core intent. Then we have something like James Wan's The Conjuring, an artful, confident throwback that succeeds in maintaining a high tensile level of pressure on our senses, crafting vital jump scares, a potent human element and all encompassing technical prowess. This is the type of brave, but stripped down horror filmmaking that forces you to analyze other elements besides just the full effectiveness of its frightening intent. Plus it's scary as hell.The Conjuring completes a modern supernatural horror film trifecta started with Wan's own Insidious in 2010 and bridged by last year's unsettling Sinister. With these films the genre has proved that this is far from a dead, now inherently clichéd area of cinema and this effort is perhaps the best of all three. After breaking onto the scene in a big way with the trend setting Saw, the director took a bit of creative detour in the eyes of most with revenge thriller Death Sentence and supernatural doll flick Dead Silence (which is vastly underrated by the way) before rebounding with the aforementioned Insidious. For The Conjuring it seems Wan has taken everything he's learned – congealing everything he's found to be effective – and assembled them exquisitely and with ample new flare to boot.The Conjuring pulls its inspiration from a case file of famed demonologists and paranormal investigators the Warrens, the husband and wife team who's other journeys inspired films such as The Amityville Horror. Here they are played respectively by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga who are now both genre regulars with roles in Insidious and the upcoming Chapter 2 due this year for the gentleman and Orphan and television's Psycho prequel Bates Motel for Farmiga. We've all seen the painful trope of priests, exorcists, psychics and every nut-job in between showing up at the eleventh hour to save a haunted family but the way they're approached in The Conjuring stands as one of the film's greatest strengths.Though it's something that should be completely obvious out of the gate (but still something those inspired by the Warren's stories forget) this is just as much their story as those experiencing the phenomena. In giving nearly as much screen time to this duo as it does the Perron's (a seven family troop lead by actors Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor and their five daughters) we grow and involve with these nine individuals so when things get terrifying we not only feel just as much for everyone on screen but everyone gets a satisfying arc. It's something so rare in most horror films. Though this dynamic is certainly not presented through these two separate camps – the fearful and the experts – but the men bond over their love of cars and their wives and the women over the unfathomable: harm befalling their children. It's a satisfying an utterly untapped approach for the genre.But \"wait, wait\" you proclaim \"this is a horror movie after all, stop talking about the little girls and get to the scares!\" Graciously, somewhat rude reader. The Conjuring is creepy, intermittently nightmarish, tense, gross, unsettling, and in its purest form, scary. This is the type of film that dares you not to hug yourself or laugh nervously in the hopes you deflect some iota of the sensation of primal fear. But these emotions are never extracted in a manipulative fashion and the jump scares are orchestrated effectively through physical objects falling, bumping, banging and generally causing off-putting noises, not blaring, out of context musical chords.The camera work is also fantastic employing every angle imaginable and even some very impressive point of view and upside-down-spin shots. It's easily Wan's best directed effort to date but never one that lets its style eclipse the mood. Similarly his use of sound both in the score (which utilizes your average brooding options as well as sharp, grating notes that call back to horror of days gone by) and practical noises such as a strained rope swinging or a door slamming shut. Again, it all adds to the experience and in eventually pulling of the major frights.Like most fare of this nature, the restrained tension does take a bit of a hit heading into the finale, as subtlety is sacrificed for more overt horror to resolve the story. Thankfully this change in approach is handled with just as much aplomb and also manages to deliver one of the most effective exorcism sequences in recent memory – a victory made all the more notable thanks to the generally overexposed and silly nature of that staple. It's not the perfect ending that the previous acts demanded but one that by no means insults the audience and still remains scary (if in a more upfront manner).Perhaps the biggest compliment I can pay The Conjuring is that it actually deserves a sequel. There are tales of the Warrens left to tell and the acting is uniformly strong enough that revisiting these characters would be more a treat then a chore. It takes a skillful filmmaker to take well worn themes and approaches (while avoiding gore and a high body count to boot) and make them seem as original as ever. Coming from a huge horror buff and one that experiences more disappointments then the average soul can handle, I can earnestly say The Conjuring is one of the best ever and what can serve as a fantastic induction into the genre for the uninitiated.",

            "review": "The key with The Conjuring is not that it has freshness on its side, as evidenced by the ream of horror fans arguing on internet sites about \"nothing new on the table\" , but while those fans will be going hungry for a very, very long time, The Conjuring does everything right for the splinter of horror it deals with.There's a lot to admire about a horror film that in this day and age stands tall and proud against the ream of remakes, sequels and teen friendly slashers that \"haunt\" the multiplexes with all too much frequency these days. Free of gore and sex, this was automatically going to alienate a good portion of the lustful members of the horror fan base, but for those who like their horror served with appetising scares and a cauldron of suspense, then this delivers plenty to your particular table.Forget the \"based on a true story\" tag, since it's kind of irrelevant in this new technological age, it's a selling gimmick that actually means \"this story might be true and we might have played with it a bit\". Regardless of hoax charges and embellishments, just buy into the premise, commit to it as a scary story in the same way as director James Wan has, for then the rewards are there for the compliant.Story essentially is based around an investigation in the early seventies by paranormal specialists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who aided the Perron family as they were victims of dreadful supernatural events at their Rhode Island home. Wan builds it deftly, letting us into the Perron families lives as they move into what they believe to be a dream home. Then things start to happen, but again Wan builds it in slow instances, creating a palpable sense of dread, his camera work intelligent. So when the big moments come they have maximum impact and have us also yearning for the Warren's to get involved.There is no over killing of the boo-jump scares, they are placed with care and marry up superbly with the mounting tension. Naturally all the cliché conventions of the haunted house movie are here, strange smells, creaky doors, ominous cellar and etc, yet these are supplemented with Wan's talented knack for a good scare and a very effective production design. From mysterious bruises and literal leg pulls – breath holding games of hide and seek – to bona fide pant soiling moments, The Conjuring is a lesson in sustained unease until the big finale is unleashed.The script is devoid of cheese and pointless filler, itself refreshing in a horror sub-genre that suffers often with these problems. Joseph Bishara's musical score is an absolute nerve shredder, and again it's a refreshing accompaniment because it doesn't resort to telegraphed shrieks to tell us to be afraid, it never overwhelms a scene. John Leonetti's cinematography has Gothic textures, both in the house and outside of the lakeside farmhouse, while the strong lead cast of Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston come up trumps for sure.Met with critical and box office success, The Conjuring justifies its reputation as a superb haunted house movie. 9/10",

            "review": "The Conjuring claims to be based on a true story about one of the Warrens' paranormal investigations. At this point, that fact doesn't quite matter, especially when this is mostly designed as a horror movie. And as a horror movie, its job is to offer real terror and take any ghostly elements seriously. The film isn't actually trying to give newer scares. This is old school stuff, but good old school horror movie stuff. This is the kind that gets to do more than pull off another jump scare trick. Another benefit the movie got is its director, James Wan, who delivers a crafty storytelling. The Conjuring is not terribly innovative, but I don't think it needed to. It's the execution that keeps everything so gripping, and I think we needed that in this suffering era of the genre.The story is actually more than the haunting of the Perrons. The first act juxtaposed between their situation and the life of the Warrens. The Warrens side is a fascinating little exposition of their daily life and job, while the Perrons are introduced like any typical horror film that has a haunted house and family in it, the danger is slow burn until they get to realize they needed help. What makes this somewhat different from those clichés is we are also supposed to root and care for the investigators, like we do not want them to be harm by the spirits as well. For that, the tension becomes much effective.Even at the less scary scenes, the film is also interesting. And yes, all the characters are worth rooting for. The major ones get their own stories told at the beginning and some flashbacks in the middle of the mystery. The performances are pretty enjoyable as they take the viewers into the characters' mind. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are excellent at exploring their roles and whatever they do are totally intriguing. Lili Taylor is engaging enough for shifting her character's innocence to something terrifying.Most of the credit goes to director James Wan who makes it all compelling. We already accepted that jump scares are inevitable to our modern horror movies, but the better scares go when it shows its campiness, like the creepy update of the Annabelle doll, and some demonic masks and makeup. They are unlike to today's tricks that depend on gore and repetitive noise. There is also genuine terror can be felt in the quiet scenes. The finale is kind of ridiculous, but it's filled with energetic action which makes the ride even much fun. Apart from the scary stuff, the film continues to employ its style that serves a lot of magnificent shots. This could be one of the best looking movies I've seen this year. The music score brings sorts of good chills.The Conjuring is no groundbreaker, but the film is best at recapturing the classic horror. Extra merit is fleshing out and adding depth to the story which made the ghost hunting investigation more thrilling. The craft is amazing and the performances are terrific. I think it has most of the things that lack in our horror films today; curiously setting the pieces together, relateable characters, good creeps, and full insanity. The Conjuring isn't meant to change the game, but because of the filmmakers' ambition and love for the genre, it is a marvelous experience.",

The Conjuring did something a horror movie hasn't been able to do in a long time. No, not scare the hell out of me but it didn't make me laugh. This movie was one of the scariest movies I have seen in a very long time. The jump scares were there but necessary and not as predictable. The story of the Warrens is one I have never heard about but the supernatural and demon possession is something I sort of believe in, and that made the movie feel more real. I really enjoyed this movie, let's see why.A family is struggling on money and buys a house in the country off a bank auction. Little do they know, this house is haunted and has an awful past. When they bought the house you would think they would do the research on the history of the house but that is just me. From the mysterious leg tugs to the creepy doll that moves on its own, this movie knows how to scare. The terror and horror in this movie is overwhelming and lives up to the hype. It takes a lot to scare me in a movie and I have seen scarier movie there were many different ways this movie had an edge.One of the first things I noticed was that all the characters looked pale. The opening scene is a side story with a few girls who are being terrorized by an old doll. Not only was the doll creepy but the poor girls looked terrible. There was no pigmentation in their face. In fact no character, even the Warrens had much color in their face. All the clothes the characters wore were dull colors and they were not vibrant. Almost every scene was dark. Even when the sun was out, it was cloudy and there were shadows everywhere. That was something I noticed early and it was the same throughout the entire movie and it made the movie scarier.The scariest scene is easily when the mother plays hide and clap or whatever that game was called. Yes, I was too scared to remember, okay, don't judge me. Everything in this scene worked. The scared mother made the scare more believable and the acting she did. The music blended in well. The idea of turning on the lights is used a lot but it always works. She is running around the house trying to find the ghost and the jumps and spooks were great. The theater jumped and screamed at the end of the scene which ended in darkness and terror.The major flaw in most horror movies is the acting. The acting in this movie, however, is actually pretty good. The family that is haunted has five kids and a few of them are stereotypical but they all do a good job. They each have a scene or two where they shine in their moment of terror. If they are scared then the audience is scared and the movie works. Seeing one of the youngest daughters sleep walk and bang her head against the closet was creepy and of course the entire movie starts with normal occurrences that are creepy and quickly elevate.Was this movie perfect? No, there were some scenes where the movie slowed down and got a little out of hand. There are scenes that are supposed to be scary but aren't and they were hard to believe. The key to a movie like this is the backstory and the \"based on a true story\" gimmick. The Warrens are real people who were paranormal investigators but there were parts of this movie where this could not have possibly been real. There were times where I was taken out of the movie because a girl was being dragged by her hair because of a ghost or something. It is hard to make a scene like that work because it looks silly.The characters of the Warrens themselves were unexpected. The movie focused on them just as much as it did on the family that was being haunted. The Warren's have a daughter of their own which was unexpected and she gets involved in a creepy scene as well. They had really good chemistry but their acting was a little weak at times. The Conjuring was a good time and I had fun with the movie but I don't think I would see it again. I think it only has the real effect once.Overall The Conjuring is a very good horror movie. Is that really saying much? Well, you tell me. I'm not a huge fan of horror movies. They are usually poorly made and cheap, but this one was different. It didn't rely on jump scares and cheesy tricks, but rather clever movements with the camera and limited CGI. The presentation of this movie was great and the writing clever. The backstory to this movie interesting and I bought it. I believe things like this happen but the movie needs to exaggerate it to make money and a good movie. I usually hate horror movies and laugh at them but this one was different. I was legitimately scared and I had fun. The scare wasn't constant and it wasn't there long but it was there. Some movies the scare is always there but in this movie it was here in bursts. For being the scariest movie I have seen in a long time it gets the WillyT Scaredy Pants Award. That's my horror genre rating so it also gets the WillyT Recommendation.",

You will have to turn your brain off though, which is what they were aiming for to instill the fear of God in you, when stupid moments happen such as demons teleporting through metal. I am very certain after seeing this film that every exorcism movie is just an attempt to scare people into becoming religious. The oh so subtle nuances such as \"We're not what you would call a religious family.\" \"You might want to change that.\" and at the end of the movie, I am not sure if anyone caught this but there was a giant quote telling people to worship God and fear the Devil. Not to mention the convenience that you cannot move out of a haunted house, you need a priest to bless it. I guess the Catholic Church never grew out of the Renaissance days of forcing its need.

It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus.I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness.I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didn't like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will.I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is just so hard not too.If you liked this review check out my new film blog: http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com",

            "review": "I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i'll definitely do the same with Inception.Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that's hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won't happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren't all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it's not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan's latest masterpiece! My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!",

            "review": "I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to \"The Dark Knight\", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film \"Paprika\" in the whole \"invading dreams\" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (\"G.I. Joe\", \"Transformers\") or the exact opposite (\"Doubt\", \"Invictus\"). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where \"Inception\" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years.Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (\"Avatar\" be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort \"Shutter Island\". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (\"The Dark Knight\"). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And \"Inception\" can proudly stand alongside \"Blade Runner\" and \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)",

            "review": "Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3.",

The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult).The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It's great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you're thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show, it is worth every penny you pay.Truly unique, like nothing i've ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn't afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending.",

            "review": "Inception is one of those movies that \"engaged\" film-goers will mistake for genius. Let me explain my theory on people and movies. There are three types of movie-watchers: passive, engaged, and intelligently engaged. Passive people will watch Die Another Day and like it just as much as the Bourne Identity. They don't go to the movies to think, they go to be entertained by cool effects and witty one-liners. Engaged people think they know what they're talking about, and generally love movies that are edgy in plot and execution but conventional enough to understand, like Fight Club and the subject of this review. They believe themselves to be refined in cinema, but, in reality, just don't quite have the intellect, cinematically speaking, to pull it off. Intelligently engaged people will appreciate the complexity of Inception, but also recognize it's a little sloppy, self-serious, over drawn, and empty. They recognize its audacity, but don't pretend like it is Kubrick or Paul Thomas Anderson. Suffice it to say, most people who fall into the engaged category will try and pretend that Inception is a 'masterpiece' and that they know everything about movies. They don't. Inception is clever, but it doesn't rank anything above respectable.The premise is ingenious, and Inception is able to live off its sheer mind-bendiness for the first 45 minutes. Leo is a specialist at entering people's minds through their dreams and extracting, or in this case, planting information. The dream world Nolan creates is so exciting and unpredictable that the audience, me included, couldn't care less about the actual story line. Unfortunately, when the magic wears off and the extravagantly overlong climax starts (almost at the midway point), things fall apart.The first problem is the eventual goal of the whole operation is seriously anti-climactic. As far as I could tell, they're trying to break up some obscure monopolistic multi-national company for a rich CEO, who in turn will give them large sums of money and Leo a way back to his kids. Sound under-developed? It is. Nolan never really fleshes it out. He is too busy creating spectacularly slick effects to get caught up in silly things like crucial plot points.When Inception hits its final profligate culmination (the climax inside the climax), I couldn't help but notice how empty it all was. Nolan makes the mistake of thinking multiple things happening at once equals suspense. In an effort to ratchet up the intensity, Nolan piles on at least 5 simultaneous plot-lines that climax at the same time. All this serves to do is suffocate the little suspense that had been built up. There is literally a fifteen minute stretch where Hans Zimmer's deafening score blares and Nolan annoyingly flips through the parallel actions like an ADD-afflicted friend who can't decide what channel to watch. It's mind- numbing, not to mention confusing as hell. One of these little subplots is particularly ridiculous and consists of a guy running around a snowbound bunker shooting people for the whole 15 minutes. Cutting-edge techno thriller? At this point, I was thinking more along the lines of a Roger Moore Bond flick.For all its structural faults, the single most damning aspect of Inception is its complete lack of heart or emotion. The one remotely human thread in the film deals with Leo and his mysterious dead wife. This thread is drawn out to excess and becomes more and more incomprehensible as the movie progresses. Inception seems to delight in keeping the audience in the dark regarding if Leo's wife is real or just a projection of his subconscious. Inception thinks it's awfully clever, but it's hard to feel emotion towards characters that you're not even sure exist. Near the end, I found the dialog between the unhappy couple completely devoid of meaning, made worse by Nolan attempting to give it resonance through close ups of people crying and a climaxing score.Despite the fact that the majority of this review deals with Inception's shortcomings, I actually like the movie as a whole. For all of its faults, I was grudgingly won over through Inception's pure style and visceral power. Nolan occasionally strikes brilliance, especially in an early scene where a dream explodes around Ellen and Leo in slow-motion virtuosity. This movie is not the genius many will claim, but it's not so bad either. Give it a shot, just don't expect to dream about it afterwards.",

            "review": "You have this basic idea and the story, they are very good. And boy did the have money. And the CGI is spectacular, yes.Further on this:Inception is constantly VERBALLY explaining what is happening, why it is happening, how it's relating to things explained earlier and so on. The rules, the plot, the inner conflicts. Even at the 2/3rd of the movie, they are still explaining basic rules. I don't see why this was necessary as most of it is repetition. You get the same stuff over and over again, supposed you didn't get it for the first time. And again: VERBALLY. Exactly like in your average, random Venezuelan soap opera.Inception does almost not have any scenes. As far as I'm concerned, movies are about scenes. Here, you'll only be able to remember certain sequences, because it's all just one big a montage of sequences. It's the montage of the master-plan from Oceans 11 for 150 minutes and it's exaggerating.The score is non-stop blaring, all the darn time, even when people are just talking to each other, music is building up constantly to give you the perception, that there are serious things going on. It's just annoying, painful for the ears and pointless. Generally important scenes are in no contrast to basic scenes. It's one big video clip.Characters. I don't remember a single name, as there is no kind of character development going on here. It's just some well dressed people. All the dialog is used up, for basic explaining like \"for dummies\", rather then building character, relationships, or just being generally cool dialog. Occasional tries sounds like tag-lines or slogans while being just plain unintelligent. Also, this is leaving the actors no space to - well - act... which is a waste of the great cast.Now all these things are very amateur scriptwriting mistakes, or if you prefer: it's a stupid movie. But no one seems to notice as Nolan does everything to convince you that you are watching something meaningful.The blaring music and the hectic editing, the fact that there are permanently 3 scenes of action cut together into one sequence underlined by an incredibly severe score, it's just there to distract. Because in fact the movie has nothing new to show us. Separate the sequences and you have the most basic and outdated action b-movie there is. Car chase. Fire fight. Explosion. Present it confusing enough so it seems complex. Same goes for the plot. The rules of the dream world are not complicated at all, you are absolutely able to sum it up in two sentences, just try. The Matrix set up it's world with a 10 minute sequence and we all got it where the whole theme is about equally, or more complex. Now Nolan is either deliberately confusing people for effect or simply because he doesn't have the skills as a scriptwriter to set up a movie. Neither of the versions seems too noble, but I guess it's a combination of those.Now the fact, that no one really seems to have noticed ALL THIS this is just a total riddle to me. Even famous film critics praise this movie as ground breaking and brilliant and I just can't see, where I am totally stupid, or why I'd construe all these mistakes into the movie, when in reality, they just weren't there.It's just malpractice, as what you have here is basic movie making rules ignored in the most inelegant fashion possible and then compensating for it with - well - money. Don't get me wrong, it's not knowing the rules and then breaking them, it just looks like not knowing the rules. It's what you could expect a first year student at a mediocre film school to do where his teacher then asks him to start all over again, with the first book. And it's just so \"in your face\". For most of the time, there is really nothing more then cutaways, the characters describing what is happening and Hans Zimmer smashing while you see expensive CGI and explosions.But everything just seems so damn serious and exclusive and the music is really dramatic. How could this movie not be good, right? But it's a trick. It's the concept of visceral over-stimulation brought to a new level and I'm shocked that it works to the point where after almost a century of film making THIS is regarded as one of the best movies of all time.IMDb TOT 250 #8.

            "review": "Contrary to the opinions of the deluded army of comic reading Nolan fanboy geeks who have descended on IMDb, Christopher Nolan has entirely and irrevocably disappeared up his own self inflated backside with this movie. I say The Emperors New Clothes because the director will sneer at anyone who doesn't understand the film and he has thus created a perfect defence mechanism. I'm sure Di Caprio et al had in depth briefings about the narrative and can explain it verbatim but us viewers are left to work it out for ourselves. And it's so full of holes, so full of irrelevant tripe and so full of itself that it isn't easy. It's incredible that its been voted the 3rd best film of all time by IMDb users. I mean seriously, that's a joke. The fanboys all want to laud Nolan as the new Kubrick (another joke) but in doing so they have voted this tosh above ALL of Kubricks work. It's such a smug self congratulatory film from the get go and it just gets smugger as time drags on.Now of course I appreciate that you can go too far in explaining every detail to the viewer with unnecessary script mechanics that insult the viewers intelligence. However, although you can go too far in explaining, you can also go too far in NOT explaining and expect the viewer to grasp in a single viewing what is a massively complex concept film - and one that's so badly flawed in so many areas for it to undermine the whole 'intellectual' nature of it. The idea of the film is OK and the film does have its moments but there are so many scenes that don't make sense that it spoils it entirely. I appreciate that 'heist' movies are usually procedural and that Nolan wanted to avoid that but in doing so he's created the most self-indulgent picture ever.I could go on about the snow scene, the thoroughly implausible way these people not only do what they do but 'assemble' as a team, the oh-I'm-Christoper-so-considerably-cleverer-than-you-are-Nolan backstory with Di Caprio's wife but I'm not going to pick apart the scenes because I'd be here for hours and I haven't got the energy left after enduring this nonsense. Besides; everything could be spun that he meant this or that (he isn't as deep as he likes you to think). Inception is all fur coat and no knickers. It explains so little of what is going on that I left feeling angry. And I generally get these films so it's not a case of me being some moronic fool who struggles to follow the weather.And billed as a completely original idea? Nah. There's obvious similarities with The Matrix, Dreamscape, Total Recall, Flatliners, Vanilla Sky, Pan's Labyrinth, Dream Demon and even one of the Star Trek Next Generation Episodes centred around the holodeck, all of which I've 'gotten' - the good ones, the bad ones, the ones you ponder for days afterwards. The fact is with this abomination I simply can't be bothered to think about it because I really don't care. I don't care about the characters, I don't care about the ending (which was excruciatingly predictable) and I don't care about how clever Nolan thinks he is. You're not mate. You've pulled a massive con with this film by creating a movie where you can call people stupid if they don't get it / like it. You get to sneer and snigger at the stupid little people. You've taken your previous successes to the movie execs and they've foolishly allowed themselves to fund your rampant self indulgence. That's what irritates me the most about this utter piffle. I understood what was understandable about this film and there are of course films where the intention is to purposely let the viewer fill in the gaps with their own imagination (generally a nice touch) but that simply isn't the case here. The story script and indeed most of the awful acting (outside of Di Caprio, Juno girl and Cillian Murphy) neither holds it together nor papers over the cracks of a weak script that's trying to be oh so deep... and badly failing.This is over 120 minutes of my life that I will never ever get back and I simply couldn't wait for the film to end. I had lost all interest in any of the characters, their backstorys or indeed the 'mission' after an hour once I woke up to the fact that he was clearly unable to pull the film together into something coherent and genuinely contemplative. And judging by the rest of the audience and the people I was with, I wasn't the only person who left feeling bitterly cheated. I congratulate Nolan on creating hysteria, mass hypnosis and hype because he's clearly managed to brainwash a lot of the audience into making them think they've seen a clever film. That's the only inception.Go and see this insidious fluff for a visual experience perhaps (even then; visually it's pretty overrated). But don't be surprised if you feel a strange peer group pressure to tell whoever you go to see it with that you understood it all when you probably didn't (or if you did; that you actually care and did so in spite of a dumb script).Nolan is not nor ever will be Kubrick. Kubrick would have done this film justice - after he had rewritten the script, changed half the cast, removed 45 minutes of length and replaced it with sensible content that made the film engaging and cohesive. I fear the next set of people to be duped will be those who vote for this trite idiocy come the Oscars.BTW I wager that Nolan watched Guy Ritchies Revolver and liked it. Congratulations Christopher, you have just descended to his level of filmmaking.Meh.",

            "review": "I'm afraid I'm a bit confused. I saw \"Inception\" last night. I had high expectations based on miles of positive ink from reviewers and professional critics, all tripping over themselves to bestow demigod status upon Christopher Nolan. These expectations were dashed to bits within the first thirty minutes of the film, and turned to a kind of dread as I realized what folks these days will accept as \"depth\" in their entertainment. I wish I'd never seen those gushing reviews, I would've enjoyed the film much more.Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Christopher Nolan's Batman reboots \"Batman Begins\" and \"The Dark Knight.\" For my money, those were without a doubt the second and third most effective superhero movies to date (sorry, Raimi wins.) The man certainly knows how to keep a story moving along, and he knows how to film action. In the case of The Dark Knight, Heath Ledger provided an emotional lynchpin non-pareil in his Joker portrait, and Nolan milked it for all it was worth. There was real pathos and genuine mortal horror built into the foundation of the film's impressive structure. Also, the fact that it was based on a comic book lowered the bar and allowed the audience to suspend just enough disbelief to allow most of the dorky plot elements to slip through and do their work.Now let's discuss obvious comparisons to an earlier effort in this vein—that is, an action movie dolled up to the nines as philosophical treatise. I'll admit that I was never a fan of The Matrix. I thought it was asinine in conception and brutish in execution, even as I admired some of the visual effects and spectacular stunt work. Comparing The Matrix's ridiculous endless \"stream-of-consciousness\" gibberish about free will with, say, Roy Batty's laconic final soliloquy in Blade Runner, is like comparing the Twilight series' moronic teen romantic angst with David Foster Wallace. Unfortunately, Inception had precisely the same effect on me, which is to say very little.Here we find the great and terrible Nolan exploring the tired territory already plundered in countless films of yore, including Hitchcock's Spellbound and 1980's genre pics such as Brain Storm, The Dead Zone, and Dreamscape. The basic premise reads like a dime store sci-fi novel's back cover: \"In the future, we can enter into each other's dreams! Feel the magic of dreams, within dreams, within dreams! Experience the thrill and wonder of miraculous \"Dream Time.\" Oh Boy!\" Within twenty minutes of the film's somewhat intriguing intro, I knew not only how it would end—I also pretty much knew how we were getting there. Nolan plays primarily to the back row, and—no offense, America—but we've been slightly dumbed down over the past few decades, and we're much easier as a whole to entertain than we used to be. Look back at a few films of the past with vast, labyrinthine plot structures like Hawk and Faulkner's \"The Big Sleep\", or practically anything by the Coen Brothers. What's defines their deep-impact gravitas, as opposed to the flat and diffuse emotional landscape of Inception? It's character development, pure and simple. In this case, Nolan didn't have a single character —especially the one played with typically earnest gusto by Leo Dicaprio—with a plausibly human fatal flaw, foible, or reason for doing uh, whatever it was he was doing. We're simply dropped into an alternate universe with rules seemingly invented to favor nerds of any stripe —almost impossibly similar to the one in The Matrix—and told to hold onto our hats, because here we go! Except we're not actually GOING anywhere, or at least not anywhere we haven't been a thousand times before.Sorry to rain on the parade of everyone that's ready to lionize C. Nolan as the great white hope of modern blockbuster cinema, but from my vantage, there is no there there. If you want a lesson in basic existential philosophy, take a class at your local community college. You'll get more out of it, and you can keep your textbook as a souvenir. If it's great car chases you're after, rent \"The French Connection,\" or \"Ronin.\" In other words, keep your high-octane action movie out of my high-concept art film. These are two tastes that do not go great together. Meanwhile, if Inception somehow does \"become a religion\" in another five years, than I'm reconsidering my continued faith in Hollywood as some kind of egalitarian oracle, where the huddled masses can go to get their myths, and feel the true power of redemption. If this is the kind of movie that will be worshipped from now on, than the god of blockbuster cinema may truly be dead.",

I am able to rap around 120 of his songs, including some really hard parts. Not only do I think he's the greatest rapper of all time, I don't think anyone else comes close.Here's the thing though. I'm a fan of his music. I don't know his birthday or the town he was born in. 99% of my knowledge comes from the music.The extent of the Stan-ery from the Stans featured in this movie is shocking. It's just too much. I am all for music having a deeper meaning for you, a connection, an emotion. But this level of obsession with his life is unhealthy.As for the movie overall, I enjoyed the Eminem parts, but I didn't care to hear the personal stories of the Stans. Those parts bored me. I didn't mind watching Stans but I was hoping to enjoy it more.(1 viewing, 8/26/2025)",

We looked up to Eminem as representatives of people who looked like us in the hip hop culture . His lyrics were bar none the best out there. He was better than Jay-Z who at the time was considered the top rapper. It's always debatable, but what wasn't was that Eminem was on fire and his first couple of albums were just ridiculous from beginning to end really. This documentary is cool and more sappy really than anything else. I know he cleaned up but I really feel like he went liberal and woke like many other rich and famous entertainers and movie stars over the last 5 years. He became someone who I don't really believe he is. I dont believe half these Hollywood elite snobs actually believe or live the nonsense they pretend to stand for now. I think they are all scared to get cancelled and now that woke is dead they just scared to look like sellouts so they stick with the BS. Anyway, the documentary is a fans wet dream, if you are still even an Eminem fan. I mean I don't really know much of his work passed 2015, and anything past 2010 isn't great anyway.

That balance made the film feel authentic, raw, and deeply human.It could have been a self-indulgent victory lap, but instead, Stan is about connection, identity, and what it means when an artist becomes a voice for millions.

            "review": "A classic feature of Danny DeVito's (far too few) works as a director is that they are utterly evil. Cruel. Wicked. Merciless to their characters and merciless to the viewer. Although this is often combined with slight exaggeration, it is exactly what I love about them.After seeing The War of the Roses the second time after having grown a little older, I still feel that particular satisfaction. But this time, there are a few more things I think about, a few more questions I ask myself. For instance: who is the bad guy in the film? Who is `to blame'? And although it's clear that the Roses both have extremely unmoveable and stubborn characters, which partly leads to the catastrophe, I came to the conclusion that Barbara is the driving force of the whole divorce story. She announces her wish to divorce upon grounds that are not quite convincing. Maybe people who do not like Michael Douglas can sympathize with her but her reasons are not fair. She invariably follows her instinct without paying any respect to other people. Kathleen Turner portrays her most believably in this insufferable phase.Oliver Rose, on the other hand, is one of those people who are proud of doing everything in a perfectly correct manner. He is therefore very sensitive and easily confronted if one doesn't acknowledge his correct behavior. He then becomes completely helpless and unable to react properly. That makes him an ideal `victim' to Barbara's striking egoism.I'm mentioning this only because it is a new aspect I found during second viewing, and I am sure it was also DeVito's intention to develop characters like this, so for him, the turbulent divorce story is not just a parable on how stupid people are in general. He of course reserved the best role in the film for himself  he is the wise man who tells the parable and who emerges victorious in the end.The War of the Roses with its merciless cruelness remains one of my favourite comedies of all time.",

            "review": "DeVito is a hit-and-miss director. He's turned out some very good films and some very bad ones. Sometimes his satire just falls short (\"Death to Smoochy,\" for example); however, \"War of the Roses\" is his strongest directorial effort to date.It's got everything - a clever script, great interaction between its two stars, exciting thrills, funny gags (without ever resorting to unnecessary crudity), and to top it all off, the direction is very effective - DeVito is heavily influenced by Hitchcock and that is very clear in the final sequence, which is reminiscent of \"Vertigo\" and \"Rear Window.\" Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner play the Rose couple - two once-happily-married people who are now, after many years together, bitter and at the end of their frustration. Deciding upon a divorce, they begin to split apart; however, negotiations regarding belongings begin to go awry as Oliver Rose (Douglas) demands more from his wife, claiming it's his money that purchased their enormous house and all objects inside.DeVito turns in a performance as the narrator, and Oliver's lawyer, who tells us at the start we are about to watch a sad tale about divorce. By the time the film has ended we've seen events spiral totally out of control - beginning with absolute believability and ending in absolute absurdity.That's the crucial part of all this. Black comedy relies on whether the dramatic arc of the content - the leap from reality to lunacy - can be believable. Many times in DeVito's film, it isn't. \"Smoochy,\" for example, was clever satire at first, and fairly reminiscent of real-life people and events; then it turned into an over-the-top revenge rampage.\"War of the Roses\" is more careful, and the arc is subtler. It's believable because the characters are given such room to grow and their conflict blossoms throughout the picture.I'd classify \"War of the Roses\" as one of the funniest, cleverest and most underrated black comedies of the 1980s - it's one of my personal favorite movies and never fails to crack me up. A cult film? Maybe; but I think many more people would enjoy it if they gave it a chance.",

They both gave electric powerful performances and really proved themselves as fine artists. They have awesome chemistry too, we first saw that in Romancing the Stone, but their chemistry in The War of the Roses is a very different kind of chemistry. Yeah sure in the first 15 minutes it shows them making passionate love and becoming infatuated with one another, then comes the kiddies, but really this film is not at all about love, this is NOT a romance story. No it's a movie about an extremely bitter married couple going through a divorce. Neither of the two are willing to give up the elegant nice house they live in. So thus the war begins. \"The gloves are off\" as Douglas's character states at one point in the film. The script is very well written, it doesn't waste any time or drag on, it entertains the entire runtime, there was not a single moment. Danny DeVito is a talented actor and director, he proves that in this film. Both his acting and his directing are both great. The events that happen throughout the film are bitter and full of anger, but it's very interesting to watch. It runs deep in character development, a movie like this would have to in order to be successful. The movie is not one to view for a \"feel good\" mood or for when you want something sweet and romantic.

A middle-aged couple with marital woes (Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner) fight over possession of their mansion-like home, and I do mean fight. DeVito takes his time building up to the actual fight, and the first half gives us the troubled couple inching along toward self-destruction. The second half -- well, if there's an adult HOME ALONE, this is definitely it. Priceless family heirlooms get smashed, the attic is booby-trapped and a loosened chandelier to rival that from PHANTOM OF THE OPERA becomes the focus of the Roses' final confrontation. It is mentioned early on that Mrs. Rose is a former gymnast, which comes in handy in later scenes where she might have otherwise been a goner. Throughout the movie, Mr. Rose claims to still love his wife, but he sure has some odd ways of showing it, including peeing on a fish dinner she whips up for some very pricey clients. Douglas as always is a wonder. He slips into the skin of this haughty, misguided individual and wears it well. He has given a handful of great performances, in WONDER BOYS, THE American PRESIDENT, FALLING DOWN and THE GAME, but this may be his best. Like Brad Pitt's bumbling Mr. Smith in MR. AND MRS. SMITH, Mr. Rose never quite gets it. It is a highly nuanced performance. Turner looks great and her Mrs. Rose never wavers from her goal, which is to divorce the increasingly unbearable Mr. Smith. You will either love or hate these always believable characters. DeVito as Mr. Smith's lawyer softens the cruel ending by adding a corny physical \"gag\" as well as a closing moment involving a phone conversation between lawyer and wife. No harm done. No one who has ever seen the chandelier scene is likely to forget it. Douglas and Turner, who with DeVito had done two previous films together, are at the top of their form here.",

Douglas and Turner are basically let loose on this film to chew the scenery and go cartoonishly over-the-top. And for the most part it's a great deal of fun seeing them do this, as both are very capable actors who can play mildly deranged very convincingly. I felt, however, that the film lost a bit of steam in its final section. As the pair went increasingly berserk in their antics, the film lost me a bit.

Why is this happening you might ask?  Simple.  The war begins when in their divorce proceedings, Oliver and Barbara desperately want to get the house in their settlement. Unforturnately, they \"both\" get the house and try to avoid coming into contact (verbal or physical) with each other, which makes the situation worse.DeVito, who is the film's onscreen narrator and plays Gavin, a close friend of Oliver's, tries to be careful here in how to handle the ongoing spat that Rose gets into.  He has made an intelligent movie here in letting the film take a very fine line between love and hate.  Also, there a few hilarious scenes where Douglas adds a special flavor to a pot of cooking fish that Turner was going to serve a small group of guests and how the house becomes a warzone that's rigged with some unexpected surprises.  Plus, the DeVito character defines the legal battle as \"a love story\".The performances are great and the photography by Stephen H. Burum (\"The Untouchables\") is stylish and marvellous.

But neither of them wants to give up their house, and both remain living in it, getting on each other's nerves as they deliberately and maliciously annoy and attack each other, each in an attempt to get the other to give up and leave.It's exactly the sort of film I don't normally enjoy, where two equally detestable parties go back and forth trying to one up each other with ridiculous shenanigans that are rarely funny and never make up for the ninety minutes of wasted time. It reminds me of dumb comedy films like Duplex—which pits neighbor against neighbor—and Are We There Yet?, in which Ice Cube goes up against his new girlfriend's mischievous kids. These sorts of films aren't typically my cup of tea, but it wasn't my turn to pick the movie, so I just sat back and watched.And then a funny thing occurred. Almost immediately, I got drawn into the story. That wasn't supposed to happen, but it did, and I was pleasantly surprised. I normally don't even care for Danny DeVito as a director, probably due to the fact that he made the awful Duplex, which I mentioned earlier. I mean, I did enjoy Matilda, but that was a family movie that I watched as a kid. War of the Roses was something else entirely, and despite my efforts, I couldn't help but enjoying it.It tells the story in a different way than others of its kind. Things unfold naturally and totally believably. Sure, some of the stunts that the characters pull reach the same levels of ridiculousness as in those other films that I didn't like, but here we get the impression that it's done for the sake of the story, rather than for just another cheap laugh. Instead of yawning, I was wide sitting wide-eyed on the edge of my seat. It's not just funny; it's also very real and poignant, especially considering the fact that most of us know someone who's had a really tough divorce and it's easy to see how things could go just as bad as they do in War of the Roses.And, unlike most of these kinds of movies and apart from my expectations, we actually end up caring about the characters, despite their overabundance of flaws. They're both selfish idiots, which makes the story so much better, but they're still believable and very well acted. From moment to moment we find ourselves siding with each one. Neither of them could be called true protagonists, as they constantly antagonize each other, but there's a balance of both deserved animosity and loathsomeness between them that is very well done. They got good actors to play these roles, and they play them so well that we almost don't notice that it could have been much worse in the hands of anyone else.The whole story is told by Danny DeVito, who plays a divorce attorney who is telling it as a warning to a prospective client who never says a word during the entire film. And the ending is great. I won't spoil it, but trust me, it's a good one. This definitely isn't the best film I've seen, but it's certainly the best of its kind, and makes me reconsider my attitude toward this type of film. I just thought the whole idea was bad, but it turns out that it's often just done very poorly.",

The screenplay is extremely clever and for once there are no compromises in this script. One can only admire the movie's commitment to the truth. It has a certain sincerity that I find absolutely refreshing, so those who call it \"cynical\" miss the point entirely. Marriage and its dissolution are dissected with a stunning finesse of psychological observation; it's all very funny, insightful, touching, ruthless, relentless. Three major stars in their prime (Douglas, Turner, De Vito)play their roles to perfection and deliver the best performance of their careers.One of the best films ever made (don't watch it on a first date though!)",

            "review": "A Masterpiece of Visual Storytelling: Where Artistic Ambition Meets Pulse-Pounding SpectacleIn the ever-evolving landscape of animated cinema emerges a groundbreaking work that redefines the boundaries of visual narrative - a tour de force that orchestrates a perfect symphony of artistic sensibility and crowd-pleasing entertainment. This animated marvel transcends conventional categorization, presenting audiences with an immersive sensory experience that lingers long after the credits roll. Through its bold fusion of painterly aesthetics and kinetic energy, the film establishes itself as a new benchmark for contemporary animation.The Anatomy of Perfection: Martial Choreography as Cinematic PoetryThe film's combat sequences amount to nothing short of a revelation in motion picture craftsmanship. Each frame throbs with meticulously calculated violence that transcends ordinary action - it's balletic brutality elevated to high art. The animators demonstrate masterful command of temporal manipulation, using judicious slow - motion effects not as gimmicks but as narrative punctuation marks. These deliberate pauses in the chaos serve dual purposes: allowing viewers to appreciate the exquisite detail in every muscle contraction and weapon trajectory while amplifying the visceral impact through dramatic tension - building.When the action accelerates to real - time velocity, the screen erupts in a fireworks display of particle effects and environmental destruction that would make Michael Bay reconsider his career choices. The technical wizardry on display draws favorable comparisons to the renowned Western animated series RWBY. With its unique camera language and precise grasp of action rhythm, this work stands out among numerous animations, creating a distinctive style of its own.Humanity in the Midst of Mayhem: A Tapestry of BrotherhoodBeneath the surface pyrotechnics lies the film's beating heart - an emotionally resonant exploration of male camaraderie that avoids sentimental tropes. The ensemble cast functions as a complex ecosystem of conflicting loyalties and shared burdens. Through subtle facial animations and body language that could rival live-action method acting, the characters reveal layered personalities that evolve organically across the narrative arc.Particularly noteworthy is the nuanced portrayal of fraternal bonds under stress - the unspoken understandings conveyed through shared glances during battle preparations, the protective instincts that override self-preservation, and the quiet moments of vulnerability hidden beneath martial bravado. These relationships attain Shakespearean depth through carefully crafted dialogue that balances poetic introspection with vernacular authenticity.Narrative Precision: The Virtue of Restraint in StorycraftIn an era plagued by narrative excess and manufactured drama, this film stands as a testament to the power of disciplined storytelling. The plot unfolds with the elegant efficiency of a Swiss timepiece, each story beat serving multiple purposes - advancing character development while maintaining relentless forward momentum. Unlike lesser productions that rely on contrived conflicts, the tension here arises naturally from established personalities clashing with environmental pressures.The screenplay demonstrates remarkable respect for audience intelligence, trusting viewers to follow complex political machinations without expositional hand-holding. Character decisions remain consistently logical within established parameters, creating a domino effect of cause-and-consequence that heightens dramatic stakes. Even minor supporting roles receive thoughtful motivation arcs, contributing to the rich tapestry of this fully realized world.Conclusion: A New High Water Mark for Animated StorytellingThis cinematic achievement represents more than mere entertainment - it's a paradigm shift in how animation can engage both heart and intellect. By harmonizing state-of-the-art visual innovation with timeless human drama, the creators have crafted a work that will undoubtedly influence the next generation of animators. It satisfies on every conceivable level: as a technical showpiece pushing the medium's boundaries, as a gripping character study, and most importantly, as pure cinematic exhilaration. For connoisseurs of animation and casual viewers alike, this film doesn't just raise the bar - it redesigns the entire stadium.",

I understand the intentions for his new movie for children and families to explain new messages and purposes. Previously the first movie was solid. However despite the colorful animation and good character designs, Ne Zha 2 is basically what I dislike about modern animated movies from the whole world.Sure, it's gorgeous animation and ambitious atmosphere is great which I do like. Especially some of the action sequences and presentations are pretty well structured and filmed. However, by simply placing a convoluted plot with many themes together that don't always work, having many characters that aren't interesting, and interlacing with modern humor that is cringeworthy doesn't make the experience worth remembering.It suffers from trying to charm many elements together in one as if the writers tried to smash many ideas into one. Alongside with characters that aren't that emotionally engaging and some coming off a bit unbearable, tone being all over the place, and despite it being non-serious, the non-serious approach and comedic aspects feels forced and doesn't really add up well.Ne Zha 2 is pretty much like illumination Entertainment but from China.

It even relies on actions like stepping on a woman's skirt, belittling and weakening female characters, and using small, powerless figures like the marmot to evoke sympathy. Is this really what a hero should be?In this show, all the supporting characters exist solely to highlight the protagonist's aura. Nezha comes from the lower class, and his defiance against authority is understandable, but his rise to power doesn't feel particularly moving. Characters like the marmot, Lady Shiji, and his mother are all designed to serve his success. These supporting roles could have been vibrant and compelling, yet they are instead portrayed as foolish or weak. And does the plot really need something as trivial as stepping on a woman's skirt to progress? Is this what a hero's rise should rely on?Nezha's character has been portrayed as impolite, which doesn't seem to provide a positive influence on children.

For instance, the transition between the lighthearted comedic tone dominating the first half and the heavy emotional atmosphere of the latter half feels unnatural, resulting in an incoherent growth arc for Nezha. His core transformation relies more on external plot devices rather than internal self-reflection or accumulated experiences. The protagonist's coming-of-age process lacks a \"spiritual baptism\" - pivotal moments like the battle against three demons were dismissed as \"game-like\" sequences that failed to deepen the character's inner conflicts.While attempting to expand its worldview and introduce more characters, the film's character development remains superficial in parts. Though portrayed as a military general, Yin Furen defining moments still revolve around maternal sacrifices, while female characters like Shiji Niangniang are reduced to stereotypical labels like \"appearance-obsessed overweight women.\" The overarching narrative remains centered on male-centric father-son relationships, with female characters lacking independence and depth.The film continues its predecessor's reliance on crude \"toilet humor\" gags. In emotional expression, its exploration of familial bonds and self-identity has been described as \"superficial,\" particularly in failing to fully develop the complex relationship between Nezha and Ao Bing.",

Nezha comes across as authentic, yet funny, and prone to angry outbursts, yet cute and caring. He makes for a great main protagonist, especially in a kids/family movie.A number of support characters, both heroes and villains, are developed well enough (given that so much run time is dedicated to action rather than - see negatives below). And some of the comic relief characters are fun.When driven by and used to support the story, the special effects are often beautiful.The story is clever. The plot is a little more complex than it seems it first; the ending is satisfying; and there's a decent moral to the story. (Maybe even a bit risky in the current political climate in China, depending on how it's interpreted.)Negatives\nNone of the above is exceptional in any way. The characters and plot are well done, but not amazing. The comedy is good, but limited in amount, and very typical for a kids movie. It certainly doesn't have anything really unique the way movies like Hero, House of Flying Daggers, or The Banquet do. Nor does it have the non-stop laughs and of movies like The Great Bicycle Race, Shaolin Soccer, or Detective Chinatown. Nothing very special, plus a major, major flaw...Only about half the movie has the positives, because the rest of the movie is an almost endless, drawn out, over-the-top fight scene - a final battle that goes on and on and on.It feels like at some point the story-teller lost influence with the director, and the animation team took over, jamming in as many effects as they could. Smaller moments throughout the movie are also examples of this. It often starts with just the right animation to show something magical happening. But then doesn't stop until another one, or two, or multiple, effects are unnecessarily thrown into the mix. The tiring end battle is where it really takes over, though and it's hard to express just how overdone it is. It really does detract from what seems a solid family cartoon at its core.With so much of the movie being that non-stop, violent, CGI-heavy final battle, it also seems unclear who the movie is for. There's too much of that for a fun family flick, yet that's clearly what the core story was *meant* to be.",

Not only did it achieve comprehensive upgrades in visual effects and character development, but it also brought new shock and emotion to the audience in the deep exploration of the plot and theme, once again proving the unlimited potential of domestic animation. After reading it, it still exceeded expectations by too much! It's a complete blow to the dimensionality reduction of certain Chinese comics! Let's talk about the only drawback first, the initial humor was a bit vulgar. However, the flaws do not overshadow the virtues, as everything else is almost perfect.The visual effect is really stunning! It can be called a masterpiece! The movements are smooth and natural, and every detail is handled very well, as if you are in a real battlefield. The visuals are even more stunning, whether it's the magnificent underwater world or the ethereal Jade Void Palace. The special effects visuals are not only gorgeous, but also very realistic. The scene of thousands of troops fighting in the air pushes the visual effect to the extreme, and the majestic atmosphere is no less than that of Hollywood blockbusters. In addition, the texture of water in the special effects is the most precise and complex, and the shots of seawater are numerous and beautiful, delicate and natural. There are even close-up shots of water patterns and mist, including the effects of seawater washing different materials and the subtle differences in the traces left behind, all of which are presented.The character images in the film are more full and three-dimensional compared to the first one, with each character having their own story and motivation, no longer a simple binary opposition of good and evil. Each character has distinct changes in personality. Increased the radiance and power of humanity.The movie continues the passionate and fantastical style of its predecessor in terms of plot, but also boldly innovates and reconstructs on the basis of traditional mythology. The worldview of the film is more complete, the boundaries between humans, demons, monsters, and immortals are clearer, and there are both contradictions and blends between different races. The plot has multiple echoes with the first part, but it is not just a simple echo, but a sublimation based on the first part.In terms of theme, the film continues the core proposition of \"breaking prejudices\" and expands to more complex social contradictions. The setting of the dragon clan being oppressed by the heavenly court due to their demon identity implies racial discrimination and class solidification in reality; Shen Gongbao's \"rebellion\" motivation has been further explored, highlighting the alienation of individuals by institutional biases. Even the dollar sign on the furnace satirizes some things. In addition, Nezha's transition from \"defying the heavens and changing his destiny\" to \"protecting the people\" explores the balance between individual heroism and collective interests.The music and soundtrack of the film are equally impressive, adding a lot of color to the film. The perfect integration of music and soundtrack with the visuals and plot of the film not only adds more artistic charm to the film, but also better enhances the atmosphere of the film.Overall, this is an excellent film that combines visuals, storytelling, and content. It not only showcases the strong power of Chinese animation after its rise, but also demonstrates the infinite possibilities of traditional Chinese mythology in the modern context.",

All technical aspects are pristine, with the sound design/mixing standing out the most. If the director wants you to hear someone chewing obnoxiously, it will sound like the mic is in his mouth.

I found myself getting lost in reflection during the film (as a 47 year old woman it really spoke to me).But it's also extremely fun to watch!Take it seriously as a true work of art, but don't at the same time, and you'll have a blast.",

While the director utilizes artistry for the story, ultimately the plot holes are undeniable, and worst of all, the ending is just ridiculous to the point where everything good that they were selling for the first hour about it devolves into a mess of a movie.Have you ever heard of the term 'reaching'? That is what the people praising this are doing. They are reaching because in the first hour of the film, the movie showed promise, and they are ignoring everything that came after, which is plot holes galore.Also, spiritually, it is a negative movie experience. The energy is negative and pointless by the end. There are no moral lessons here of which should have been if they stuck with the depth and substance of the first hour of a woman trying to regain her youth. Instead, it just devolves into a vapid gore fest in the third act that is just meant to stir up publicity and cause shock.The first hour was pretty decent, but if this is what passes as a \"good movie\" or a \"classic\" these days as many reviews are trying to push, then we are in trouble. It has those very few elements at times of a masterpiece like many movies that try to push boundaries do, but ultimately it's a bad movie that doesn't even come close to a Wes Craven Scream film, and those aren't even masterpieces.We need to cut down the hyperbole these days. Being different is not enough to be a masterpiece, and I feel bad for people who think this is anything great. They must have only seen twenty films in their lifetimes.",

I highly recommend you avoid this if you dislike needles or blood.While the concept was interesting and had potential, the execution was very poor. The film very much lacked substance and felt very hollow. I wouldn't be surprised if this didn't take very much time to produce. It's quite disappointing that this film passed through multiple layers of boards, people, studios, financing and was approved.This is a great film for hollow people with very few thoughts or zero internal monologue, it will appear deep, thoughtful and daring to them.",

While that movie had interesting visual style, the screenplay was bad & stupid and the characters were uninteresting.However she improved a lot from her last movie. \"The Substance\" looks amazing, the shots, the score, the editing, production design and even costumes are well thought out. The screenplay is also great (she actually won an award for Best Screenplay at Cannes for \"The Substance\"), the decisions that characters are making are understandable - they are results from characters' determination to achieve their goals.I also loved Demi Moore's perfomance (it's worth mentioning that I wasn't considering her good actress at all, but after watching that movie, the first thought that came to my mind was that maybe she isn't a bad actress, she was just starring in bad movies), it's definitely highlight of her carrer. Margaret Qualley is great as always. Even Dennis Quaid, despite little screen time, gives fun and engaging perfomance.Probably the most talked about part of that movie is gore and body horror elements. And, yeah, I must admit that this movie is pretty extreme and may be hard to watch for some viewers. Personally during those scenes I wasn't feeling disgusted or smth, cause I'm a big fan of disturbing cinema, so I'm used to that stuff, but I understand that it may be a hard journey for others. That proves how great make-up artist did their job (i would be happy seeing this movie nominated for an Oscar for \"best make-up and hairstyling) and how sick and twisted Fargeat's imagination is.Overall, I strongly recommend this movie. It may not be for everyone, but it's worth checking out for yourself and seeing it for yourself, cause even if u don't like it, u can't deny is isn't one of the most insane, extreme and interesting movie of this year (or even a decade).",

            "review": "The movie started off with an intriguing premise. Seeing Demi Moore back on the big screen, portraying a character grappling with age-related insecurities, was both refreshing and powerful. Moore, as one of the most stunning and graceful mature actresses I've seen, brought a rawness to the role that really hit home. Her character's struggles with the pressure of maintaining physical beauty in a society obsessed with youth and appearance were deeply relatable, and it felt like the film was setting up to explore these important themes in a thoughtful and impactful way.As the plot unfolded, it continued to develop in a promising direction. It took a darker turn, delving into the complexities of self-perception and the destructive obsession with physical perfection. The themes of fractured identity and a lack of self-love were poignant, and for a while, the film seemed to be handling these modern issues effectively. The storyline, touching on the fragmentation of personalities and the psychological consequences of societal pressures, was gripping. I was fully invested in seeing how the narrative would conclude.However, when it came to the ending, it all fell apart. What could have been a profound and thought-provoking conclusion instead devolved into a senseless and, frankly, off-putting sequence that left a bad taste. It felt like all the promise of the earlier parts of the film was undone by a chaotic, incoherent, and ultimately unsatisfying resolution. The ending not only failed to tie up the themes but also undermined the strength of the narrative. It was a great idea, but the execution at the end dragged the entire movie down, leaving me disappointed and questioning what it had all been for.",

After seeing a film with a score of 8, and even with 2 famous actresses, and even with a woman director, whom I had never heard of before, and even in the horror genre, and even in the body horror subgenre.Wow! I told myself and immediately turned on the inflated ratings, waiting, not yet knowing why.I won't hide it for long. That's exactly what happened.The subgenre itself is very niche. Well, judge for yourself: open fractures, blood, intestines. The human body is mutating into something absolutely disgusting. By the way, it is not always only the human body that gets in this format.As a subgenre, why not, but it has never been massive, but this film...The film's wrapper is very attractive. An incomprehensible description and a bright, beautiful, dynamic trailer. You can understand what is depicted there only after viewing, so if the viewer has not familiarized himself with the genre on the profile resource, he will most likely be unpleasantly surprised.But the ratings are high, so the audience was lured by the picture, they slipped an absolute abomination. By the standards of modern sleek mass cinema, that's for sure. And the viewer was satisfied?I would bet that the viewer was just shocked + the film has a message and some kind of morality, so positive ratings still prevail.But I, as a person for whom this genre has existed for 40 years, was satisfied only because of the acting and very cool makeup. They really molded this something at the end out of I don't even want to guess what.But if you delve into the plot, the behavior of the characters sometimes, then the picture begins to float.The fact that all men are goats, objectification of women is bad and that chasing beauty at the sacrifice of health is bad, I realized in the first 15 minutes. Why do I need 2 more hours?Yes, the camera hitting the interesting places of women is cool done, but I did not come to an adult film.The ending is so-so. The scene in the hall is deliberately slipping into trash. You understand that, so it was and it was. It feels like the film deliberately tried to be something sublime and about meaning until the last moment, so as to surprise so much in the end. It surprised me wonderfully.It's a shame for the line with the classmate of the main character. It gets its logical conclusion, but in the middle of the film I thought that the authors would go away, but this is already subjective.Objectively, if you evaluate and compare with others, not even the best representatives of the genre. This movie is just average. But it must be borne in mind that for a film like this, a score of 7 is already a wow success. For understanding, The Thing film has a score of 8.2, and after it there are films of the 30s and only after that the films of Cronenberg begin.Just so you understand. If the score of a horror story is from 7 points, then this is already a masterpiece, but here ... 8 ...\nI do not understand. I'm blocking it.",

            "review": "'The Phoenician Scheme (2025)' is, unsurprisingly, unmistakably a Wes Anderson movie. At this point, a \"Wes Anderson movie\" is almost a genre in and of itself. I'm pretty sure the quirky writer-director could do this in his sleep by now, and it kind of feels like that's what he's been doing recently. He consistently churns out films with no real theme or narrative drive or even reason to exist other than to suitably fit into the twee style he has curated over his career, crafting experiences that are ostensibly style as substance but often feel closer to all style and no substance. What I mean is that where his earlier films felt as though he was using his style to tell a specific and meaningful story, his more recent efforts feel like he is fitting a story into his style. He comes up with quaint nonsense that can be easily configured into the still-pleasing shape all his work takes, putting very little into things like theme or character or emotion. His work is starting to get a tiny bit tedious because it feels like he's simply going through the motions, never really challenging himself or using his specific talents to do anything other than the same thing he's been doing for years. That's not to imply that his newest stuff is bad, as they're just as good as any of his holistically more successful efforts from a formal and technical point of view, but they do lack a certain essentiality that makes them feel ever-so-slightly ho-hum. His latest feature - a business-centred pseudo satirical comedy starring a deadpan Benicio Del Toro, a commanding Mia Threapleton and an absurd Michael Cera, alongside a litany of famous faces both familiar and new - is a perfectly serviceable effort, filled with plenty of visual delight and enjoyable eccentricities. It's undeniable Anderson has complete control of his craft, capable of finely tuning his oxymoronically homogeneous idiosyncrasies so they still enchant even if they no longer surprise. However, it's sort of expected at this point that he can - and will - deliver something like this to this level of quality, which has the unfortunate side-effect of dampening the effectiveness - or, at least, novelty - of his cinematic prowess. The strength of his direction and the specificity of his writing aren't as potent as they once were precisely because they've been at the same level for so long that they're part of the proverbial furniture at this point. Of course, taking excellence for granted isn't something that ought to be encouraged, but it's undeniably difficult to get excited about something we've seen so many times before. Plus, it doesn't help that nothing in this flick hasn't been done better before in one of Anderson's earlier efforts. To be fair, it isn't actually any worse than his previous few, at least formally and technically speaking. However, there is a sense that he's running out of steam - or, at least, resting on his laurels - and comfortably releasing self-eating snakes that are so specifically 'Wes Anderson' that they're almost parodies of actual 'Wes Anderson' films. Still, the movie is enjoyable enough for what it is. It's never boring, moves at a pleasant pace, is well-made in its every aspect, and also provokes a handful of chuckles. The problem is that it only ever connects so deeply, that it never truly moves or inspires. That's primarily because there's no real sense of emotion to it, despite it having a family-focused central arc, and it also isn't really about anything. It's a good effort, for sure, and will probably feel extremely refreshing if you aren't all that familiar with its directors work. It's just a little hard to get excited about something that honestly seems a bit perfunctory. Maybe that's too harsh a term, but it's certainly something that comes to mind as you watch the feature unfold. Again, it is entertaining and it is well-crafted. Its cast, most of whom are now veterans in this field, know exactly what to do with the dialogue they're given, and Wes Anderson's signature style is still fairly fun even after all this time. It isn't hilarious, but there are a handful of funny gags and even more mildly amusing moments, and the narrative is engaging for its entirety. By the same token, though it's only ever mildly amusing, never really getting out of second - or, potentially, third - gear and therefore feeling like one of its director's more minor efforts. It's good enough for what it is, and - again - is very confident and compelling when it comes to its form, but it's just lacking a certain something that's difficult to put my finger on. It's a solid effort, and I definitely don't regret seeing it, but it certainly isn't one of Anderson's best. It's inessential, but enjoyable nevertheless.",

And it's almost as silly.An incredible cast of actors is reduced to a series of bit-part cameos, which should be annoying, but I couldn't help thinking that it was probably enormous fun to make. And Bill Murray as God is without doubt one of my favourite ever bits of casting. The Tom Hanks and Bryan Cranston double act is a total hoot.So I certainly can't recommend it to everyone, but I will definitely recommend it to people who I think will get it.

            "review": "Many world-renowned auteurs with distinct styles take years between projects-filmmakers like Christopher Nolan, Kathryn Bigelow, or Steve McQueen. Wes Anderson is inarguably in league with them. Yet lately, he seems to be hurting his own legacy by producing too much, too quickly. In the past five years alone, he's released four feature films and four short films-including The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar (2023), which finally earned him his first Oscar. The latest in this near-annual output is The Phoenician Scheme (2025).The Phoenician Scheme tells the story of wealthy and maligned industrialist Zsa Zsa Korda (Benicio Del Toro), who, after surviving one too many assassination attempts by rivals, names his forgotten novitiate daughter Liesl (Mia Threapleton) as his sole heir-over his eight sons. Together with Liesl and his insect-obsessed secretary Bjorn (Michael Cera), he sets off to secure his magnum opus: a network of infrastructure projects in Phoenicia.Since Isle of Dogs (2018), Anderson's films have increasingly felt like cast reunions performing stylized imitations of his earlier work, rather than urgent artistic ventures. Both The French Dispatch (2021) and Asteroid City (2023) wandered through quirk without narrative drive-pleasant but aimless. His Roald Dahl short films, by contrast, felt stronger, largely because they stuck closer to plot, message, and character. In The Phoenician Scheme, Anderson attempts a return to plot, giving his aesthetic more structure and a clearer objective.Yet the story at the film's core feels creaky. It plays like a director trying to reawaken his own narrative instincts, so strong in weaving together tones and threads in The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) or The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). The Phoenician Scheme in contrast lacks emotional depth. It rarely moves beyond clever quips and fails to fully explore the father-daughter relationship central to the film. The political commentary, meanwhile, is blunt and didactic, sacrificing subtlety and impact in favor of heavy-handed messaging.Anderson has always toyed with caricature and cliché-it's part of his charm. But here, the self-awareness seems to have dulled. There are still magically hilarious moments where everything clicks-like a high-stakes basketball game featuring Tom Hanks and Bryan Cranston-but many other scenes come across as oblivious to their own hollow aphorisms and tropes.The cast, as ever, is impressive-and thankfully more curtailed than in recent ensemble-heavy efforts. This tighter scope allows for some character development. Newcomers Threapleton and Cera adapt well to Anderson's rapid-fire, deadpan style. Del Toro, however-despite being one of the most talented and underrated actors of the past few decades-feels miscast. His gritty, grounded style clashes with Anderson's hyper-stylized cadence. Del Toro seems out of sync, his performance feeling stiff and unnatural. Zsa Zsa doesn't come across as a genuine industrialist, but rather as someone pretending to be one.That said, Anderson's signature aesthetic remains intact. The film is visually immaculate, his humor still lands in places, and the editing maintains that conspiratorial wink to the audience. Wisely, Anderson pulls back from the exaggerated look of Asteroid City and The French Dispatch, which had begun to feel like parodies of his own work.Ultimately, The Phoenician Scheme corrects some of Anderson's recent missteps but still leaves viewers emotionally cold and narratively uninvested. The technical mastery is still there, and familiar faces remain endearing, but Del Toro's misaligned performance in such a pivotal role weakens the film's core. The result is a forgettable, if not unwelcome, addition to Anderson's unique filmography. One hopes the American director continues to pursue his singular style-but slows down and reinvests in story and heart next time around. There's no need to rush.",

The dry wit of Richard Ayoade, one of Britain's smartest comedians, and Michael Cera particularly stand out.It's difficult not to see Benicio del Toro's empathy free, slave-owning, greedy oligarch character spawning children (mostly boys) with wives he has no relationship with as making some reference to some of today's real life characters, much like Isle of Dogs was used to make a subtle reference to the growing anti-immigration narrative when released around a decade ago, but like Isle of Dogs, the ending of the film leaves room for a positive interpretation of current turbulent times.",

I also loved Moonrise Kingdom for its extended use of Benjamin Britten.*End Credits - worth watching as they tastefully but playfully hold your attention.* Costumes and sets - as always of the highest quality\n* Colour Pallette - the most confectionary-like cinema has ever been; a mixture of stop animation, play within a film and situationist comedy.It's easy to dismiss Wes Anderson films as being all the same but if this were the only film he'd made it would easily be the best of the year so far.

The movie feels like it's on autopilot from the very first scenes and Anderson just ends up feeling like he's recycling his usual tropes to the effect of feeling so dull. I didn't hate this movie but I was amazed by how much of a chore it was to get through.Anderson's last few movies have been criticised for disappearing too far into his own style but I personally enjoyed the unique experiences those movies provided. The French Dispatch is his magnum opus in my opinion and even if I thought Asteroid City was too overwhelming at times I still liked how much it left me to chew on but that's not the case here at all. The story was painfully uninteresting to me and it's told in the flattest, more linear way imaginable. It's essentially a series of business negotiations for nearly the entire runtime and not only do they feel insanely repetitive but they often drag on far longer than necessary.I'm not really sure what Anderson's ultimate vision for this film because he doesn't really do anything behind the camera that we haven't seen from him before and his trademark humour really didn't work for me this time around. It's very deadpan with a lot of moments of quirkiness that just feel forced, it actually made me cringe more often than it didn't with the climax in particular feeling quite ridiculous. From a cinematography perspective it looks gorgeous and I really did feel like the performances were hitting the right notes but I just felt nothing. Most of the supporting characters just feel one noted and they end up feeling like quirks more than anything. Benicio Del Toro's character can be entertaining but he's just far too unlikable and never really felt like the script did much to redeem him by the time the film ends.The Phoenician Scheme is disappointingly flat in almost every way and for whatever criticisms people might have with Anderson's recent offerings at least they had the energy that I thought was sorely missing here. It's not a particularly interesting story with characters that never really peaked my interest at all and the few interesting gimmicks Anderson does use feel like they've been done by him before and better. There's almost surprises technically and it really did end up feeling like Anderson was trying to make one of his own movies.

I've seen people say Michael Cera stole the movie but in my opinion it was Richard Ayoada who stole it fr9m he walked on screen. As Wes Anderson as a Qes Anderson movie can be. Everything from the camera shots to the background screams Wes and I loved every minute of it. Even though I left the cinema still confused about the ending I wouldn't change a thing. I almost didn't notice Bill Murray at first, hes hidden so well amongst an absolutely stellar cast. If you are a Wes fan this is a must, so much better than Asteroid City.",

Then the typically precious, overelaborate Wes Anderson dialogue, animatronic cardboard characters in place of actual feeling ones and general sense of being caught in the slow turning pages of a hipster control-freak children's story book will gradually diminish your interest in the film.

            "review": "MOONRISE KINGDOM was the first Wes Anderson movie I saw, and it's still my favorite. His newest is THE PHOENICIAN SCHEME, a caper about Zsa-Zsa Korda (Benicio del Toro), a businessman trying to squeeze his investors for more money to help overhaul the infrastructure of Phoenicia with slave labor. Joining him on his swindling journey are his estranged nun-to-be daughter Liesel (Mia Threapleton) and his assistant/tutor Bjørn (Michael Cera). It's a wonder how this is the first Anderson film that has Cera in it, the style is a perfect fit for him. If you're not familiar with the style, it's basically side scrolling camera work, symmetrical compositions, vibrant colors, and quick, whimsical dialogue. His best works have both style and substance. This movie definitely has the style, but I think the substance was lacking for me. Maybe I'm just getting tired of his schtick. The plot felt too mechanical and less emotional. It didn't truly have me invested in any of the characters. I laughed quite a bit though. It's always fun to see who Anderson has in his movies. They probably just come in for a day or two, have some fun filming their scene then leave. As always, this has exquisite art direction and production design. I really enjoyed the main trio. Ultimately, THE PHOENICIAN SCHEME boils down to whether or not you're a fan of Wes Anderson movies. This is one of the quirkier ones in his repertoire. In my opinion, it's visually beautiful and funny, but forgettable.",

            "review": "Wes Anderson's The Phoenician Scheme is a film that looks like art, but feels like air - weightless, aimless, and emotionally barren. It's a museum piece: visually exquisite, technically polished, and utterly disconnected from the audience it should be trying to reach.The film assembles an A-list cast - Benicio del Toro, Tilda Swinton, Jeffrey Wright, and more - and gives them almost nothing to do but perform in fragments. Del Toro, in particular, delivers a sincere, grounded performance that deserves a much better film. He carries sorrow, memory, and depth on his face - all of which are squandered by a script that prefers aesthetic games over human truth.Narratively, the film is a mess. The central character dies repeatedly, appears in surreal \"heavenly\" trials, begs money from estranged people, and pursues a cryptic \"project\" that's never made emotionally or intellectually clear. These events don't connect - not symbolically, not structurally. They're scattered scenes dressed in Anderson's trademark symmetry, but without any pulse behind them. It's not storytelling. It's theater with the plot torn out.For viewers expecting another Grand Budapest Hotel - a film with wit, heart, stakes, and storytelling - this is a staggering disappointment. That movie was from another planet in the best sense; this one is stranded in its own head. The Phoenician Scheme substitutes cohesion with confusion and calls it depth. It's not deep - it's vague. It's not subtle - it's evasive.Worse still, the film weaponizes style as if that alone justifies its existence. It doesn't. The score, the framing, the dialogue - all of it points to a filmmaker more invested in aesthetic gymnastics than in reaching the audience with meaning.Anderson is capable of brilliance. Here, he retreats into self-indulgence. The Phoenician Scheme is a beautiful shell, meticulously painted, and completely hollow.",

But we were the only ones. In all fairness there was only 8 people (including my wife & I). The movie wraps at our theater in four days, so there's that.I can only describe this movie as 30's German art-deco meets The Marx Brothers. Very much an 'artsy' film that requires the audience to interpret and react before the next zing comes at you like a 100mph fastball. At the risk of being tagged a snob, not everyone will get it or like it. I call it 'intelligent slapstick comedy,' as opposed to 'Airplane' or 'Caddyshack' of which both are funny as hell and two of my favourite all-timers. But here there is a difference in comedy styling. I'm a Baby Boomer out of Hollywood-Los Angeles so I'm very familiar with the art-deco architecture seen in Beverly Hills, Palm Springs and older Hollywood hills homes and buildings. The Firestone Tire Building (now Citadel Outlets) on Washington Blvd. Is a perfect example of art-deco styling.One has to be fast on their ears to make out much of the dialogue, as there are plenty of accents to go around and the lines come at you machine gun speed.The star-studded cast is impressive: Benicio Del Toro plays the lead role and gets co-write credits. Mia Threapleton plays a most impressive Sister Liesi. Michael Cerna delivers on one character then switches gears to play another. Scarlett Johansson is la cousine. Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston, Bill Murray, Benedict Cumberbatch, Willem Defoe, F. Murray Abraham, Hope Davis. Apparently everyone wanted in on this project directed by Wes Anderson. It is worth the parade and well worth the price of admission if a 30's art-deco, German slapstick comedy is your shtick.",

This film, which chronicles the decades-spanning career of an ambitious architect, aims for epic grandeur but instead delivers a bloated and convoluted narrative that collapses under its own weight.While the film boasts a striking visual style, meticulously recreating period details and crafting impressive architectural set pieces, this commitment to aesthetic flourishes comes at the expense of a compelling story. We are presented with a series of loosely connected vignettes, each more ponderous than the last, detailing the triumphs and tribulations of a man more cipher than character.The film's central problem is its length. Clocking in far too long, \"Brutalist\" feels like a never-ending tour of a building you've already seen every corner of. The complicated, multi-stranded plot, only adds to the confusion, leaving the audience struggling to piece together a narrative that feels unnecessarily fragmented.Ultimately, \"Brutalist\" is a classic case of style over substance. It's a film that clearly prioritizes visual spectacle over emotional resonance, leaving the viewer feeling impressed but ultimately detached. It's a beautifully constructed edifice with nothing inside, a testament to the fact that even the most impressive facade can't mask a hollow core. This film is less a moving story and more an endurance test, a stark reminder that bigger isn't always better, and that sometimes, less is truly more.

Epic period dramas are not very trendy and asking the audience to sit for three and a half hours, is not an easy demand. With that being said, I went to the cinema curious to see what Brady Corbet made. I have to say that the movie has a nice start and development. Even if the character of László Tóth never existed and this is in fact a pure fictional story, overall it is pretty believable, at least in the first half. We see the protagonist getting to America, slowly integrating in the society and finding his first important job: building a complex for the rich businessman Var Buren.The characterization of the protagonist is incredible: we get to know him inside out, which is his backstory, his strengths, his weaknesses, his vices. A brilliant mind that accomplished so much in his home country, getting awarded for the buildings that he projected. The film does a nice job in contextualizing the historical period, through the tragic events that happened during the 40s and 50s in Europe. Screenwriters managed to create a compelling character that needed to endure many difficulties through his life, as he needed to re-affirm his name in the USA. The director is setting this as a biopic, therefore I was expecting to see all the main important parts of this fictional life. But unfortunately I feel that the movie lost its identity halfway through. I can pinpoint the exact moment where things went sideways: there is a scene set in Italy, where the overall mood completely changed and it seemed to watch a different film altogether. The plot never recovered from this mistake. The story is split into four different parts: the first three parts are following the life of László from the 40s until the 60s, and then there is an incredible time jump that brings us directly to the 80s, showing us all the work that the Hungarian architect did in the US. The problem is that the audience never saw what actually happened in those 20 years. The director focused too much on pointless details and it seemed that he remembered that he needed to actually wrap the film somehow. The ending feels rushed and messy.The movie has good ideas, but it feels very unbalanced towards the end. It is truly a pity, because all the right ingredients are there: incredible cast composed by many great names, wonderful photography, compelling and overall well written story. I am also sure that some of the shots are pretty iconic. Potentially this could have been a modern masterpiece. I strongly believe that considering the nature and the length of the production, this would have worked way better as a limited series of maybe 4-5 episodes. Unfortunately, by the end a lot of things are left unanswered. My final mark is 6.5. I recognized that a lot of effort was made into this project, but potential was wasted.",

Unlike similarly bleak films like Blue Ruin or There Will Be Blood, which draw you in with tension and morbid curiosity, this plot leads nowhere. There's no payoff... just escalating disaster.From the opening scenes, we follow one man's relentless suffering. Any initial empathy quickly evaporates when, mere minutes in, he's berating a prostitute at a brothel. His choices consistently dig him deeper into misery and subservience, accompanied by a \"soundtrack\" that could be described as a cat walking across the far end of a piano. Three hours of discordant notes matching his downward spiral.What's particularly frustrating is the historical context. During an era of American prosperity and opportunity, this accomplished architect with significant works to his name chooses to live small. As an immigrant from a similar background, I find his self-defeating approach baffling. His eloquence, architectural mastery, and charisma suggest he could have carved out a very different path.The film drowns in excess: gratuitous nudity, excessive shaky cam, overwhelming sadness, and random weirdness. If the first half dangles hope and potential, the second half plunges into absolute despair. It's relentlessly dark. A parade of gloom, doom, and ARCHITECTURE. Perhaps this reflects Laszlo Toth's character and work, but I left the theater in a thoroughly bitter mood.That aside, Adrien Brody and Guy Pearce deliver phenomenal performances, but they can't salvage a film that seems designed to make its audience suffer.

It's meant to describe the style of architecture its main protagonist employs - harsh, massive, cold concrete monstrosities of buildings. But it also speaks to the brutality of class-divided America, and perhaps of humankind itself.Some think it's an epic drama of immigration to America by WWII refugees, and part one attests to that and promises much. The we have part 2 where the main character, Hungarian immigrant Laszlo Toth, finds a mentor in the rich but empty-hearted and ultimately cruel businessman Harrison Van Buren and his caricature family. A major architectural project for the local town alternatively promises much then falls apart, much like Toth's relationship with .. just about everyone. The movie falls apart here as it leaps blindingly from confused and often totally unnecessary scene to scene, wasting another couple of hours.Then we have the epilogue, 20 years later, which is bizarre. It explains little and leaves a lot of unanswered questions. When the final credits roll (at a jarring 30 degree angle), the numbness and frank shock in the cinema audience was palpable.Adrien Brody gives a fabulous performance in the lead role, although you are never quite sure whether you are supposed to be on his side or not. Felicity Jones seems miscast to me as his refugee wife, physically weak but mentally strong, to me she just doesn't look right for the role. Then there is Guy Pearce, one of my favourite actors, who is very good in the Van Buren role but not Oscar material as has been touted - his performance is just slightly too affected for that.I'll give it 6 stars for the grandeur of vision, even if unrealised, as well as Brody's performance and the great musical score. But it will go down in my memory as yet another if these grand artistic Hollywood visions that don't really work, and descend into confusion and outright stupidity at times. Many will praise it and score it highly, like those who view a pretentious painting as a visionary masterpiece.

At the beginning of the film, I expected it to be a concentration camp survivor's story. And it is that, but it's also more complicated than that. The protagonist (played by Adrian Brody) is gradually revealed to have more layers to his personality than we thought. At first we see him as a refugee at the end of World War II doing grunt work in a relative's small furniture factory to survive, but then we realize that he has a brilliant and creative mind that functions on a much higher level than his worldly position would indicate. He's dependent on other people to survive. At first they appear to be kind benefactors, but then turn out to be really slimy individuals. If anything goes wrong, he's invariably blamed for it, and sent packing. He's given a bad time by virtually everyone. He realizes that, being an outsider, an undesirable foreigner, that he's at an extreme disadvantage. The kindness of strangers turns out to be not-so-kind, after all. But when his former prewar stardom in the field of architecture becomes known, suddenly those who despised him and treated him like garbage, start sucking up to him because they want the prestige of being associated with him. Then there is his sexual impotence, a nascent heroin addiction, and a wife trapped in Europe by the endless bureaucracy of the repatriation process. I don't feel that I could adequately give more details without spoilers.This turns out to be like QUEER, in that it is highly episodic, and that the episodes do not neatly dovetail together. It's also like QUEER in that, rather puzzlingly, so many of the male characters can't seem to keep their hands off the Brody character, although he never reacts to it. This is a tough movie because there are a lot of good things about it, despite having a plot that simply doesn't hang together. Its biggest assets are the evocative art direction, photography, costumes, and the performances of Brody and the actress who plays his wife. (It's also true that they are given the best material; the other characters are right out of 19th Century melodrama-a sweet orphaned ingenue, a \"friend\" who leads good people into bad habits, and villains who do every dastardly deed but wear capes and twirl their mustaches.)

However, I couldn't have been more wrong-I was absorbed from the very first minutes and drawn into a rare and powerful cinematic experience.The Brutalist is a dense, demanding, and meticulous film. It's one of those works that require a certain state of mind, and honestly, I know it's not for everyone. I completely understand those who might find it boring or excessive, but for me, it was the opposite. From the start, I was captivated by the masterful editing, which maintains an almost hypnotic rhythm without ever becoming monotonous, the outstanding performances that bring incredibly complex characters to life, and the breathtaking cinematography that turns each frame into a true work of art. The soundtrack, grand and carefully integrated, adds an epic layer to many scenes, contributing to the film's immersive atmosphere.To illustrate how I felt watching this masterpiece, I recently had a completely different experience with Nosferatu (2024). Although they are very different films, Nosferatu is half as long, has more action, and yet I found it absurdly boring and soulless (like 75% of Eggers' films). On the other hand, The Brutalist, with its slower development, managed to keep me engaged in every scene, allowing me to form a genuine emotional connection with the story. In my view, cinema should involve me and evoke emotions, and The Brutalist achieved exactly that.The story itself is relatively straightforward, but its depth lies in the themes it explores. Following the journey of a Jewish architect who emigrates to the United States in search of a new life, the film delves into topics such as immigration, identity, ambition, greed, and the desire to leave a lasting legacy. More than just the story, it's the characters that make The Brutalist so impactful. Each one carries an emotional complexity that unfolds layer by layer, and the performances are simply astounding. It's impossible not to feel immersed in the protagonist's journey, brilliantly portrayed by Adrien Brody.It's not hard to understand, but it's an extremely dense work with much to reflect on regarding themes such as immigration, greed, ambition, legacy, and architecture. However, it's the depth of the characters and the remarkable performances that define each moment.Despite all its strengths, the film is not perfect. For me, the biggest issue is the ending (well before the epilogue), which felt rushed and somewhat inconclusive for certain characters who played such a significant role throughout this odyssey. It's as if the film was building up to something grand but didn't quite know how to wrap it up in the most satisfying way. The epilogue tries to fill some of these gaps, but it still feels like a somewhat abrupt conclusion for a film that demands so much from the audience over nearly four hours.Overall, The Brutalist is a film that requires patience and commitment but rewards those who allow themselves to be immersed in it. It's not an easy film, but it's a powerful and emotionally rich cinematic experience that encourages reflection on timeless themes in a visually stunning way. Without a doubt, it's a film that will stay with me for a long time. And this, my friends, is cinema in its purest form.",

            "review": "It is the kind of movie that is so hard to rate. Is it a masterpiece? Is it great or is it just another movie that just look at itself? He has all the elements of a great story of a great film and yet to me it does not deliver.For three and half hours long there's only one question in my mind I couldn't shake : what is it about. And I could never answer that question not even at the end if ever there was one. The whole thing left me septic.But in all honesty, there isn't much to say about it all. To me it's like I've been handed over a homework. If watching « this kind of movie », I want to feel an experience, be engulfed in the ambiance of a whole, I want to be caught in the prospect of what the delivery will be, I want to feel like I've been outsmarted in some ways. None of it here.Brody is magnificent, so is Pearce. Jones too, surely. Cinematography is mastered without a doubt, editing is smooth, and for three and a half hours it is enjoyable if you're able to glean the little sparks that here and there will keep you hungry for more.If it was trying to lead me into an underlying experience, meaning or point of view, well I didn't find the path, or maybe was it just too obscure to even grasp a fragment of what the purpose of it all was.Yes, it works whatever it is about or whatever it thinks it is about. I doubt it will be a movie that's remembered. It not particularly bold. It makes an attempt at being powerful but it never strikes. It too clean, it's too plain. It makes you believe straight from the opening shot that it will be grandiose. But it doesn't hold it promise.I feel a bit duped by what I've watched. Just because you write a movie about an « unusual » subject, just because you try an unorthodox approach at something that's already been said before, well it seems sufficient to make praise.That is not enough for me. This didn't prove me anything. I think it is possible and achievable and somewhat too easy to make beautiful movies that will pass for profound when it is just a very well made movie without substance.",

            "review": "The Brutalist is full of surprises. The characters are not who you expect - not in the Scooby Doo ending kinda way, but in the more subtle, incremental ways that real people reveal themselves - they unfurl over time, in new context, or when forced by circumstance.Here the circumstance is post-WWII-horror. Adrien Brody's Laszlo, a jewish architect who escaped the clutches of bloody Europe, ekes into the welcoming arms of America - or is confronted by them - in a frenetic opening sequence that evokes being literally birthed by the Statue of Liberty. His becomes a journey of perpetually navigating life's variety of horrors: existential, professional, familial, intimate - never taking his eyes off the prize of grand achievement, and never assessing the value of that prize to begin with. What's the lesson?Is it the shameful discovery that his success wasn't born in spite of his trauma, but because of it? Do we owe a debt to abuse? To the forces of culture, country, power and those who wield it, in the building of our brutal legacies (and homelands)? Are our lives gasoline that gets burned up en route to some place more meaningful?The movie is charming, cool looking, and not boring (did you hear it was long?). It feels like it's based on an old novel - a mysterious tome that I would love to mine for some of the details the movie refuses to share. But there is no novel. This aging Man's search for meaning becomes ours as well. And any greater understanding of Laszlo's arrival, his families' machinations, his country and rootlessness, or the evolution of his very feelings on the subjects, for better or worse, feels up to us to construct.",

            "review": "It is ambitious and has some beautiful sequences, especially the opening sequence with the Statue of Liberty shot. Brody, as usual, is strong. The score is also strong. The movie has an epic sweep to it but also, I would say, some unnecessary scenes here and there. I didn't think all the sex scenes were necessary, or at least I thought they were too drawn out, and various other interstitial shots that felt excessive. I didn't like Pearce's performance so much. Although he's playing an unlikable character, true, there's just an artificiality about his delivery and mannerisms that I didn't like here.The epilogue of the movie ends a little flat and on an odd note. It's just one of those \"weird\" endings, imo, but that's pretty typical for an a24 movie. I cared about Brody's character, but where did he REALLY go, in the end? Ask yourself that. He gets lost a bit, for me, with all the other side narratives and architectural explorations going on, and then it just kind of ends.Thematically, the movie reflects the tension between artistry and capitalism well. Is it overlong? Yes, but the intermission dampens the impact of that. Would I want to see it again? No.",

Hey, if you're giving us a 3 1/2 hour movie, I really appreciate the break.Corbet gave us so much more than a retro-novelty to stretch our legs and use the bathroom, though. The Brutalist is what I want more of in movies: gorgeous cinema, challenging material, conflicts with perspective, and a story that asks us \"why\" again right after getting an answer to the previous question.It helps that the lead character, a Hungarian architect escaping Germany in the mid-20th century for being Jewish, is played by Adrian Brody, the son of a Hungarian immigrant himself (and who grew up speaking the language). Brody is no stranger to stand-out performances, and this marathon outing is no exception.We see so much more than just one man's journey or struggle, and I credit the director for delivering us art instead of relying on the safety net of a well-written story. Corbet has a talent for this, a freshness that I hope will continue to push the industry forward.",

            "review": "I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like \"The Phantom Menace,\" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was \"How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?\" rather than \"How entertaining is this film overall?\" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.Critics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children's movies, like \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Mary Poppins,\" are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, \"Adventures in Babysitting\"), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like \"Home Alone\" and \"Mrs. Doubtfire.\" Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.But much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--\"Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers\"--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.Not that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.The problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary \"muggle\" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.Although the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I've never seen happen before, though I don't go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.The answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he's kicked out, he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn't enough tying them all together.What we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form, it's almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling's series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing.",

            "review": "We live in a world where economics is hard. This forces practical limitations when making a movie. Time and money are sadly finite, cinema owners need to be pleased as well as fans and computer animation ain't perfect. Given these limitations, this film is about as close to human perfection as it is possible to achieve. However, it's extremely clear what an immense challenge it is to turn Philosopher's Stone from book to film.Two and a half hours is not long to explore a wonderful, magical world. Furthermore, the directors have bowed to the inevitable temptation to show us things that cannot be communicated so effectively in a book. The consequence is the feeling of a slightly breathless sprint in places.It also means that the movie has to stay true to the spirit of the book rather than to the letter of it. There are omissions and there are changes. The changes that were made capture and maintain the spirit of the story really well; indeed, there are places where the story is more clearly and straightforwardly told in the movie than in the book. Some aspects of the story are fleshed out on screen and the additions are delightful, completely in keeping with the flavour of the world.The humour of the movie is inevitably more visual than that of the book; no belly laughs, but a lot of smiles. Some punchlines have changed, but the reasons why the jokes are funny remain the same. Not knowing exactly what's coming next is a good thing! It's all kept tasteful, classy and above the belt; there's nothing to cringe about.The voice acting is almost uniformly brilliant. However, there are occasions where some of the actors are required to convey high emotions and are only given a second or two of face shot, or head-and-shoulders shot, to do so. This isn't as much freedom as they need and they fall a little short. The blame here must fall on the decision to give the actors too much to do too quickly, not on the actors themselves.Other than these rare jarring instances, the physical acting is frequently excellent and seldom less than completely adequate, judged against the highest of targets set by the book's clear emotion descriptions.Dan Radcliffe has the look, the mannerisms and the charm of Harry down pat. His strongest expressions are the bemusement that must be inherent at entering a world where science does not rule alone and the bravery that Harry shows in his achievements. Emma Watson possibly slightly overplays Hermione, but does so in a fully endearing fashion. There's one scene which gives her too little chance to truly express panic; otherwise her performance needs no changes.Rupert Grint has comic timing way beyond his years, hitting Ron's lines perfectly. Tom Felton makes a stylish Draco; Matt Lewis' Neville character suffers from the acceleration, so the finale does come as a slight characterisation shock.The Phelps brothers' Fred and George are distinctively cheeky rather than proactive pranksters; Chris Rankin imbues Percy with genuine authority. Sean Biggerstaff shines; his Oliver Wood is likeable and an ideal Quidditch team captain.Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid is the single dominant adult character, with maximum laughs extracted at every step. The movie changes strongly exaggerate one side of Hagrid's nature, though; probably inevitable considering how much plot exposition his character has.David Bradley has a vicious Argus Filch; John Hurt's Ollivander is an eccentric treat, giving a wonderful introduction to the Wizarding World. The professors are uniformly excellent, though Richard Harris' Dumbledore comes off as disappointingly flat until the end.The most ambitious point of the movie is the computer generated imagery. The stills are wonderful, but the fastest animation is restricted by the limitations of real-world technology. The book makes extremely stringent demands of the CGI; sometimes their overall effect in the movie is merely good rather than insanely great. Some of the magic spells and effects look awesome; others don't capture the imagination nearly so much.The world cannot yet completely convincingly animate human beings doing inhuman things, which serves as a clear reminder that you need fictional magic to make the impossible possible. The Quidditch scene is the most demanding of them all; while the sequence is action-packed and good-looking, disappointingly, it's not a total success. Perhaps some of the scenes would have been better with more conventional special effects? (For instance, the lower-tech-looking Sorting Hat scene is one of the most delightful of them all.)The set looks gorgeous. However, it may not stand up to detailed analysis. It's fairly obvious that things are shot in many disparate locations, rather than one big Hogwarts School near Hogsmeade.The score is absolutely wonderful. The soundtrack may rely too heavily on The Famous Bit, but it's clear that the balance and mixture of things in the finished movie are exactly right.The feel of the whole movie is everything fans could have hoped for. The dialogue is intensely measured, the colouring is suitably epic, the selection of what to leave in is really tightly considered. You get chills in your spine at the right places; you feel the triumphs as all-encompassing endorphin highs. It's clear that the production have thought long, hard and lovingly. They are true fans of the story, they are the right people for the job, it all bodes very well for the second film.So it could never have been the film that the hyper-literalists were hoping for, then, but it is as good as the practicalities of the real world could possibly permit. Don't expect miracles and you'll love it. I look forward to watching it again and again.8/10 at the very least. A really satisfactory film!",

The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.I'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that they'll tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams's perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There's something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the \"magical\" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of them.Welcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you're a ten-year-old kid who doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you'll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren't perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they're looking at things that were added in post production!Usually, in kids' movies, there's a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they're watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you'll see a host of familiar faces as \"guest stars\" but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they're so convincing as the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable Snape, and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can't imagine they've had any other career prior to these movies! Is there any kid who doesn't immediately attribute the word \"earwax\" to Richard Harris, point out striped cats as \"Maggie Smith cats\", mumble \"Shouldn't have said that,\" when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?First movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling's fantasy world, there's so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.Each installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of the exposition. If a three-headed dog doesn't immediately conjure the name \"Fluffy,\" chess pieces have never come to life in your imagination, you don't laugh at the idea of counting your birthday presents, and you don't know what Richard Harris wants most in the world, you're missing out on one of the great joys in life. If somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie theaters Thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie.",

            "review": "To millions of children of all ages, November 16 has been more eagerly anticipated than Christmas, as the long-awaited film version of J. K. Rowling's beloved novel \"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone\" hits the screen.Each of Rowling's four Harry Potter books have been critically acclaimed worldwide best-sellers, turning a generation of video-game playing children into avid readers.In translating Rowling's world of wizards and magic to the screen, the film makers claimed to be intensely aware of the fans' high expectations and had sworn to be faithful to the book.\"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone\" is indeed the most loyal film adaptation of a book that this fan has ever seen.It's the story of an orphaned boy who discovers on his eleventh birthday that his parents were wizards and that he is in fact a famous and powerful wizard himself.Released from the clutches of his desperately ordinary (and non-magical) Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia - and their deliciously obnoxious son Dudley - Harry takes his place in the wizarding world as a first year student at the venerated Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.A great deal of \"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone\" is an introduction to this fantastic and dangerous world and its richly drawn characters. There's not only a lot of plot to cover in this film, but an entire world to create.At two and a half hours long (hit the restroom before it starts), the film includes the book's most memorable scenes, bringing many of them to life with pure cinematic wizardry.The Quidditch match (a soccer/hockey/rugby thing played on broomsticks) is much more exciting on the screen than on the page, as is the bathroom battle with an enormous mountain troll and the larger-than-life game of wizard's chess.The frightening aspects of the book are in full force in the film, and its PG rating (for some scary moments) should be taken seriously.Screenwriter Steven Kloves (\"Wonder Boys\") has done a fine job of streamlining Rowling's tale while maintaining its spirit. Director Chris Columbus (\"Home Alone\") makes good on his promise to be faithful to the book. But at times the film is a bit too reverent; you want the actors to cut loose and have a bit more fun.Columbus clearly understands that fantasy works best when it's played most real. Across the board, his fine ensemble of actors are so perfectly cast that they appear to have literally stepped out of Rowling's book.In the title role, Daniel Radcliffe pulls off the very difficult task of playing an introverted hero who spends most of the movie reacting to the amazing sights and events around him. He beautifully captures the deep soul and untapped potential of Harry Potter. And when this kid smiles the screen lights up.Rupert Grint is delightful as Harry's sardonic buddy Ron Weasley and Emma Watson nearly steals the film as their overachieving friend Hermione Granger. Three cheers to the film makers for giving three unknown child actors the top billing they deserve.The strong cast of veteran actors includes Richard Harris as the wise Headmaster Dumbledore and Robbie Coltrane as the lovable giant Hagrid. Alan Rickman is wonderfully villainous as Professor Snape and Zoe Wanamaker has just the right touch of girls gym teacher as flying instructor Madame Hooch.As the strict but just Professor McGonagall, Oscar winner Maggie Smith seems born to play the role - and is ready for another Oscar.John Cleese (as Nearly Headless Nick) and Julie Walters (as Mrs. Weasley) have all-too-brief cameo roles, but if the next film \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" remains true to the book, we'll be seeing more of them.In addition to being highly engaging, the film is a marvelous thing to look at. From the bustling wizard street Diagon Alley to the magnificently gothic Hogwarts School to the dark and misty Forbidden Forest, the film breaks new ground in imaginative production design.To paraphrase the film's tagline, let the magic (and box office records) begin.",

            "review": "Once upon a time (and not that long ago), in the vivid, fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling, a character was born:  A boy.  A young boy named Harry, who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long, long time, and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world.  And now, thanks to the magic of the cinema, Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture, `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves.  Indeed, Harry Potter is a boy, but not just any boy; because Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just happens to be a wizard.  But, orphaned as a baby, Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), who never let him in on the fact that he was, well-- what he was.  It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister-- Harry's mother-- because she was a witch; nor of Harry's father because he, too, was a wizard.  When Harry turns eleven, however, the secret is out of the bag when-- after some strange goings-on-- a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to `Hogwarts,' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born:  The gift of magic!  And from the moment Harry boards the train (from station platform nine-and-three-quarters) that will take him to his destiny, the magic is alive-- for Harry, and for the audience, as well; and it's a journey you will never forget.What a monumental undertaking to even think of attempting-- translating and transferring this passionately beloved work from novel to the screen. Because to millions of people, Harry and his companions are so much more than merely characters in a book; these are characters for whom people have made a special place in their hearts, which puts a great burden of trust upon the man who would attempt to bring them to life.  And Chris Columbus, it turns out, was the right man for the job.  More than rising to the occasion and with some magic of his own-- and a lot of help from an extraordinarily talented cast and crew-- Columbus has delivered a film that is not only true to the story, but true to the very spirit that makes Harry Potter so special.  The special effects are absolutely beyond astounding, and Columbus, with a keen eye for detail and without missing a beat, keeps it all on track and moving right along at a pace and with a sense of timing that makes this an absorbing, thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable experience from beginning to end.  From the opening frame you get the feeling that you're about to have a singular experience; and you're right. Because you've just entered the world of Harry Potter.  And it's magic.Even having the best special effects do not a great movie make, however, and this film is no exception; what catapults this one to the top are the performances, beginning with Radcliffe, whom you quickly forget is an actor playing a part.  And that about sums up what kind of a job this young man does here.  Without question, he IS Harry Potter, physically and emotionally, and when he waves his wand and does what he does, you believe it.  A wonderful performance by a gifted actor who has a great career ahead of him; without question the perfect choice for the role of Harry.Also turning in excellent performances are Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione.  As with Radcliffe, the casting here could not have been more perfect.  Grint is `Everyboy,' with that special glint in his eye and a manner that makes him especially endearing.  And the spunky Watson adds some real sparkle to the film as Hermione, the one with the sense of urgency and the wherewithal to get things done; a real role model for young girls everywhere.It's obvious that a lot of care went into the casting of this film, and it's a big part of why it is so successful.  Richard Harris, as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore; Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall; John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander; Ian Hart as Professor Quirrell.  Exceptional performances from one and all, with two that stand out as especially memorable:  Robbie Coltrane, who readily conveys the fact that Hagrid's heart is of a size that matches that of the man; and Alan Rickman, as Professor Severus Snape, deliciously droll while demonstrating menace through the fine art of articulation.The additional supporting cast includes John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick), Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick), Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley), Zoe Wanamaker (Madame Hooch), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Harry Melling (Dudley) and David Bradley (Filch).  From Rowling's imagination to the written page to real life (albeit via the movie screen), `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a triumph many times over; a unique film of truly universal appeal, the likes of which is as rare as, well-- a sorcerer's stone.  A film in which adults and children alike will rejoice, because it speaks to the heart in a universal language of life, love, experience and imagination; a film that states unequivocally that magic exists-- as long as there's a single child with a single dream somewhere in the world, and real wizards like J.K. Rowling, Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves and every member of this wonderful cast and crew around to bring it to life as they have here.  An instant classic in every sense of the word, this is truly a film for the ages.  A remarkable achievement, this IS the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",

How-ever after watching the movie it did make me a Harry Potter movie fan. And needless to say - this continues to remain my favourite of HP series. That brings to a point here.... the effect of expectations over a movie. True, expectations reduce joy.Without going into the story I would certainly say Chris Columbus churns out a perfect pot-pourri of emotions, suspense and magic, delivering something appealing to all ages.Every character brought to life on screen has done justice and leave an impression on you. Particularly notable performances by Emma Watson and Alan Rickman.CGI are in plenty and made good of. The Quedditch game is picturised amazingly. The wizard's chess is treat to eyes.Let's hope that the forthcoming HP series carries the similar magical touch.",

            "review": "I feel, next to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best book-to-movie adaptation that I've ever seen. The sets were stunning - the actors were first rate - the effects were breathtaking.  The film flowed quite smoothly in it's transition from page to screen, never tripping on the awkward conventions that other books on film have struggled with.   The screenplay, by Steven Kloves, stripped away all unnecessary elements to get to the root of the story.  Though many events from the book were excluded, the essential ones made it to the film. And it makes for one smooth story and very enjoyable movie-going experience.Many kudos to Chris Columbus and the rest of the Harry Potter cast/crew for not turning this movie into what it easily could have become:  a 2 and a half hour commercial advertisement for action figures and collectibles, kid's meals and fast food tie-ins, soft drinks and snack products, etc. and instead focused on bringing J.K. Rowling's story to life as accurately and as lovingly as it deserves.  There has been much speculation on whether Columbus was the correct choice for the first two installments of the series and I say to that, Yes.  I feel that he accomplished what most would have failed.  He has proven, at least to me, that Diagon Alley truly exists - if only I could find the right brick to tap on.  The world of Harry Potter is no longer fantasy to me, but instead a place where any of us mere Muggles could hope to visit, one day.One of my favorite moments, is what I'm going to refer to as the Adrenaline Sequence.  By Adrenaline Sequence, I mean the sequence in a movie that for all intents and purposes, doesn't necessarily propel the story, but gives the audience a huge theatrical payoff, ala the Pod Race sequence in The Phantom Menace.  The Adrenaline Sequence for this particular movie is the Quidditch sequence.  I was very happy to finally see the 'hockey/soccer hybrid on a broomstick' come to life.  The Quidditch Sequence is, by far, my favorite sequence in the whole film.  The scene is dizzying in it's violence and it's one breathless moment after another.  My hat goes off to Columbus and his team for succeeding in making this scene as memorable as it should be.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantastic movie for children of all ages.  Fans and non-fans alike will enjoy this colorful story of good versus evil and the friendships that endure.",

The movie is more preoccupied with populating Hogwarts with ghosts and moving staircases than it is with characters of any depth.  Everyone from the book, Harry included, suffers from a serious lack of on-screen development, and as a consequence the story lurches  ponderously from event to event without the throughline that stong character development would bring.

But as a film....Frankly I would rather remove one of my own limbs with a blunt hacksaw, then eat it raw before I watched this again. 2.5 hours of some of the most boring drivel, bad acting, weak special effects and irritating children you could hope to come across. The sooner these \"Child Stars\" descend into a drug and sodomy filled adolescence the better for all concerned.Yes I have read the books, and yes, I enjoyed them, but this is still one of the dullest films I've ever encountered. Sticking to the original story is one thing, but when the audience are left praying for the last 5 chapters to be cut, something's gone wrong.Back to my original point - where did the £85 million go? The Quidditch match was about on a par with King Kong for realism, and using Fungus the Bogeyman for the Troll was a masterpiece of imagination-free modelling. Perhaps all the money went on getting the magic tricks to look right? Or maybe not. How much effort does it take to have some brat wave his wand, the camera cuts away, comedy explosion sound effect, then camera cuts back to child with spiky hair and blackened face? Pure genius! They really have pushed back the boundaries of comedy here.All in all I feel cheated out of 2.5 hours of my life, and I strongly recommend that you don't fall into the same trap. If you have 2.5 hours that you really want rid of, then I'd suggest spending it slowly rubbing sandpaper over your eyeballs - it's cheaper, and more pleasant on the senses.",

            "review": "HARRY POTTER / (2001) *** (out of four)Here's a method of evaluating a movie based on previously published material: ask yourself if the film makes you want to read the material from which it is based?Before the release of \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" I was one of the few remaining souls who had not read J.K. Rowling's fantasy book series. After screening the first film installment, I did want to read the book. Borrowing the novel from a family member, I briefly skimmed over the chapters. The book's intelligence and similarities with the film really surprised me.With over 100 million copies sold in over 46 different languages, J.K. Rowling's best-selling series of books has become a worldwide phenomenon. Naturally, with soaring expectations abound, the filmmakers felt great pressure to create a faithful adaptation. They have. This film is essentially a visualization of the words in the novel, with very few differences.That said, the film does run into a few conflicts with the book's story. The middle of the movie has nowhere to go. It's like a false second act; almost nothing of major significance occurs in this period of the film. The young characters wander from scene to scene with nothing much to do and nothing much to say. We're left with a grand display of eye-popping special effects.\"Harry Potter\" certainly dazzles us with a solid beginning and an engaging final act, however. We first meet a young wizard boy named Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). Soon after the film opens, the boy discovers he has magical powers. He's then thrust into an enchanting world of sorcery, magic, and witchcraft. He's sent to a school for young wizard children, where he meets new friends, learns about magic, and participates in fun competitions. But someone at the school doesn't like Harry, as mysterious events begin to occur. Harry soon finds himself in the middle of a diabolical scheme of revenge. Who is the culprit and what do they want with Harry?The film asks some involving questions. Too bad it doesn't give enough depth to the side characters or subplots. We don't really care about the mystery because we don't know enough about the suspects. The movie does conclude with a twist, but it doesn't encourage another examination of the movie. It lacks a foundation altogether. The story spends so much time foreshadowing the villain's identity, it is pointless for the story to abandon its proceeding plot points and develop a new villain at the end. The book gets away with this; the movie does not.After his gentle \"Home Alone\" and sweet-natured \"Stepmom,\" many questioned the ability of director Chris Columbus to bring a sense of darkness to the story-and for good reason. \"Harry Potter\" contains charming, likable characters and a rich pallet of lush, inventive images. Unfortunately, the film lacks an edge. It's missing the dark atmosphere Rowling's novel so vividly brought to life. Columbus does construct some memorable sequences, but the individual scenes themselves are much better than the movie as a whole.Despite it's childish story and pre-teen characters, many define \"Harry Potter\" as a film for all ages. While that's debatable, during my screening, adults were plowing through the isles every five minutes. Going to the bathroom? Getting drink refills? Buying concessions? Who knows? But not a single child budged from their seat. Their eyes were glued to the big screen.Conclusion: It's a sure-fire experience for children, especially if they've read the books. But adults may not encounter the same enticement as kids. Then again, if I had nothing better to do than to count the people leaving the theater, why am I recommending the film?",

It's not that it was godawful, but having read the book, I knew how it all worked out-- and I had no confidence left that there would be anything the least bit interesting about how Rowling's story would be illustrated.That's what it is; the book faithfully, and dully, illustrated, line by line.  It's so faithful to the order of incidents (and the need to keep the story moving) that it has no time to give us any of the characterization that made us root for Harry; at best we get instantly recognizable movie stereotypes (Draco Malfoy has a Richie Rich 'do, therefore he must be from the same snotty rich kids' fraternity as Greg Marmalard).  Seemingly ideal casting-- Alan Rickman as Snape, say-- is wasted when the characters turn out only to have half a dozen lines in the entire movie, most of them expository.  Maggie Smith, Ian Hart, Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, all wasted; the peerless John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick has, as memory serves, all of two lines-- one to explain why he's nearly headless, and one to announce, in Boys' Own Weekly cliches, that the Quidditch Cup is sure going to be hotly contested this year.  Maybe only Robbie Coltrane and John Hurt get enough dialogue to begin to sketch a character.The other problem-- not unrelated, surely-- is that Chris Columbus is, for the millionth time, the wrong wrong wrong director for the job.  He has no sense of magic, of mystery, of English eccentricity.  Give him two wizards skulking about a suburban tract house, and he'll make them seem as ordinary as two retirees strolling and chatting about the weather.  Give him an evil spirit sucking the blood of a dead unicorn and being interrupted by a centaur, and he makes it seem like two retirees strolling and chatting about the weather.  Give him a chess game, and he makes it seem like World War III.  Give him Gringott's bank, and he ignores the baroque set that's been built and can't wait to show us a big pile of gold, which is surely a bit revealing.

I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day. I'm endlessly sad that I have to wait another three years for a new Nolan movie, and hope that he switches back to something more intriguing than the life of a scientist.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/20/2023)",

Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the \"Manhattan Project\", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and \"Fat Man\" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the \"Atomic Age\". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as \"the father of the atomic bomb\", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic \"Oppenheimer\", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's \"Dunkirk\", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, \"Oppenheimer\" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10.",

I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",

In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due.

            "review": "After a busy career filled with masterpieces, Christopher Nolan finally succeeded in creating a perfect film. In fact, Oppenheimer might be the best film I have watched in a long, long time.Very different from Nolan's recent films, especially the sci-fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the biopic/drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he has tried to tackle yet. Personally, I must admit that unlike most of Nolan's previous films, I didn't go into this one with overly high expectations. Based on the genre and material the film is based on, I couldn't see how Christopher Nolan could give it his unique touch, and how it could stand alongside films like \"The Dark Knight\" trilogy, \"Inception,\" and \"Interstellar\" in his filmography. The film proved me wrong. While it's not my personal top pick in Nolan's filmography, it's undoubtedly his best film so far.One can think of Oppenheimer as a great example of catching lightning in a bottle. After a career full of brilliant works and paradigm-shifting films, Sir Nolan managed to craft a film that, in my opinion, is perfect. Against all odds, the film attracted an unparalleled audience size for its genre and proved to studios and public opinion that true cinema will always prevail.Anyone who has read the book \"American Prometheus\" on which the film is based can attest to the incredible editing work Nolan did to turn it from a long and detail-packed narrative into a compact film that captivated such a wide audience. While the direction of the film is no less than masterful and is considered the strongest aspect of the film by critics and award bodies in the US and worldwide, in my opinion, the writing is actually the strongest aspect of the film - whether or not you consider the complex material it's based on.The script of Nolan's Oppenheimer is based prominently on the book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Anyone familiar with the book can attest that Nolan's adaptation, transforming a lengthy, detail-laden book filled with transcripts and theoretical physics into a blockbuster that captivated a wide audience, is nothing short of miraculous. While the film's directing is undoubtedly masterful and even considered the film's strongest aspect by critics and award bodies worldwide, in my personal opinion, the writing is the most powerful element of the film-even without taking into account the complex material it is based on.Legendary Irish actor Cillian Murphy leads the film with one of the best performances seen on the big screen, with his presence dominating the screen time throughout the film's 3 hours, allowing him to leave a long-lasting mark on the history of cinema. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an impressive performance, capping off a career of over a decade of roles that didn't demand too much acting prowess from him.The film is 3 hours long yet goes by very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.The way Nolan chose to compose the film, and Jennifer Lame's amazing editing (which unusually resembles more of an action film's editing than that of a drama), make the film very dynamic, with its extended length almost unnoticeable. The other technical aspects also strive for perfection - whether it's the costumes, set design, or cinematography.A huge standout element of the film is the superb soundtrack by Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson, who won an Oscar, Grammy, and numerous other awards for his work on this film. According to Nolan himself, the film is divided into three acts: the first resembling a hero origin story, the second like a heist film, and the third like a courtroom drama. It's impressive how the soundtrack mirrors these acts perfectly, each suited to the genre portrayed on screen while maintaining consistency in the melodies and musical themes presented throughout the film. Using about 40 string players, 15 wind instruments, one harp, and a synthesizer, Göransson managed to meet both his and Nolan's high expectations, creating one of the most breathtaking soundtrack albums in recent years. The cinematography is stunning, and the editing is cutting-edge. As I mentioned, this movie is a masterpiece in pretty much all technical fronts as well.Sir Nolan is well known for his profound love and respect for science, as well as his understanding of its importance in both storytelling and real-world impact. This is reflected in the themes he chooses to explore, the logical framework behind his scripts, and the technical aspects of his filmmaking process. From project to project, he tries to tell captivating stories that highlight the vital role of scientists and the value of intellect in the modern era. Oppenheimer is no exception, but in this project, Nolan aimed to explore not only the importance and positive influence of scientific innovations, but also the consequences they have on all of us and how they might achieve not only what was initially intended.When watching the film, you can't help but feel it's a collaborative effort of a highly talented ensemble - from the actors to every single person responsible for every small detail in the film's production, all under the guidance of an experienced artist who has honed his craft over a career of more than 20 years. It feels like all of Nolan's previous films and the various genres he attempted to tackle improved his filmmaking abilities in different and diverse aspects, so that ultimately everything converged into this film, in which every aspect strives for absolute perfection, delivering everything we've come to expect from a Christopher Nolan film.Among Sir Christopher Nolan's strengths is that he for sure knows how to do a proper ending sequence. He is rather well known for that. However, with Oppenheimer, he took this skill to a whole new level. A gut-wrenching, emotionally devastating ending that knocks the wind out of the viewer and leaves him speechless, contemplating everything he just witnessed and the implications it has for our world, ever relevant in these uncertain times. With Göransson's unforgettable music and Murphy's brilliant acting, this scene serves as one of my personal favorite ending scenes in a movie ever.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in their seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.After a career filled with masterpieces and amazing films, Christopher Nolan finally managed to craft a perfect film- and to my great delight, he finally received the recognition he deserves. Despite all odds, the film managed to captivate audiences in disproportionate amounts for its genre, proving to studios and audience opinion alike that true cinema will always prevail. The year is only halfway through, but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, writing, directing, acting, score- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. I watched it once already and am going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",

Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day!

The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight.

This film would've been so much stronger with 40 less minutes of chatter before the bomb test, and 30 minutes less after the test. I absolutely LOVE long, \"boring\" movies. I'm a freak for Malick or Reichardt, but this? I would've left if I wasn't with friends.Nolan has a difficult time when directing anything slightly out of his comfort zone.

He thinks that is a hold up note, so he pulls his gun. She only wanted to date him and he hooks up with her. Russell (Eddie Murphy) wants that days run to be easy, to get to his 25th Wedding Anniversary dinner that night. And Russell is planing to leave his job, and they will start a B&B. But his boss has other ideas, and puts him on a terrible run, and worse, pairs him with Travis. Travis comes from a family of cops, but couldn't make the cut, so he is a guard. He is rather a goofball. Just when one gets tired of his stupid decisions, he makes a good one. While on their run, they get hijacked, and they figure they are going to be robbed, and then killed. Turns out the only thing Travis is good at is driving, so there are some interesting chase scenes, and those wanting the truck are very determined, and it was well planned out. A problem with this movie is that it is very uneven. Fun and interesting intermixed with dumb and stupid. Russell seems to be along for the ride. Travis seems either to act totally dense or simply out of his league. We do meet up with Zoe again, and that adds an interesting twist. A very lightweight movie that has its charms. One will not feel they wasted time watching it, nor would they want to watch it again to see if there are important things they missed.",

And let me tell you, this film absolutely slays. From the very first scene, you're glued to the screen, and that feeling just doesn't let up. As the movie went on, I kept thinking, \"Come on, it has to slow down at some point, right? Give us a breather.\" Nope, no breaks, no dips, not even a hint of slowdown. Anora has one of the best paces I've ever experienced in a movie.Anora, a sex worker and a tough girl from Brooklyn, meets the son of a Russian oligarch and, in a whirlwind of madness, marries him. But her fairytale quickly turns into a nightmare when the news reaches Russia, and his parents do everything they can to annul their marriage. The lead actress, Mikey Madison, who plays Anora, is an absolute revelation. She effortlessly combines sexiness, femininity, childlike innocence, and toughness in a way that leaves you speechless. She's going to go very, very far, and don't be surprised if you see her nominated for an Oscar. Personally, I'd also give a Best Supporting Actor nomination to Mark Eidelshtein, who plays the Russian son. He's the most entertaining thing I've seen in a long time. Fantastic.Anora is a punch to the face of the traditional fairytale concept. It's a realistic, violent, raw, funny, and ultimately sweet modern Cinderella story.

Their chemistry is instant and spellbinding. Her life changes dramatically as they get married.Mikey Madison is miraculous as the young woman whose fairy tale dream comes alive. But unlike Elizabeth Taylor in \"Butterfield 8\" or Elisabeth Shue in \"Leaving Las Vegas\", the female protagonist here never becomes the classic hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold. She remains tough as nails, chock full of rage and ready to throw her next punch until the very end. While she never becomes a savory person, her resolve never wanes. She knows how to stick up for herself and rejects with fury those who fail in this regard. It's one of the best performances of the year.Just when you think you know where this is going, it upends your expectations and proves to be a much more challenging film with a sobering reality at its core. Many have referred to this as partly a comedy. In all honesty, that's a bit of a stretch, notwithstanding a dark sense of humor. Fair warning, this film is pretty taxing on the psyche.

It had some similar tones and focuses, but otherwise Anora was a new beast of its own. I will say that towards the meat of the film, it got WAY more Safdie Brothers than I was expecting! A lot of people yelling over each other for a very long time! Very tense!The movie sort of moves in three acts, as many great films do. I was getting the feeling towards the beginning it was going to feel a bit like Boogie Nights in structure, and I would say that that was pretty spot on. You have your party, your conflict, and your conclusion. Without saying too much about it, I will say that the ending made the entire movie for me, and my girlfriend agreed. You have a 2-hour experience that is mostly funny and mostly riveting, that all feels a little pulpy while still offering a lot of very on-point details on the sex work experience, but it all feels for-fun until you get to the ending. Rather than an ending that wraps things up nicely in a pretty little bow, it's an ending that unties the bow, and opens the box, and leaves you with the RAW reality of it all. I was a bit in awe taking in the very specific energy of the packed room as the silent credits hit and people very slowly began making their way (very quietly) out of the auditorium.Mikey Madison is fantastic as Anora. Seeing the ads for the film, I expected a bubbly, sweet girl - but she plays a hard, sassy, hustler who is VERY New York City, and it was a pleasant surprise. Anora is a mostly likable character, but not always, and that only adds to her humanity and the overall realism and complexity of her functionality as a main character. You will experience a rollercoaster of ups and downs with her, and the depth feels very real. She is also extremely HOT and there's ALOT of SEX in this movie.The whole cast is fantastic, but new faces Mark Eidelshtein and Yura Borisov make the strongest imprints as capable actors who deserve much more casting in the future. Eidelshtein stole the show as the most believable rich boy on a rampage ever, and Borisov's nuanced presence was loud AF without the need for many words.I definitely think this is one of Baker's two finest films thus far, perhaps his best, and one of the best films of 2024. It's really great to see how well this movie is doing. The house was totally packed on a Monday night at 9:30 PM, and I hear it's opening weekend numbers were some of the highest this year. This is the kind of original, sincere, relevant filmmaking that needs to be seen, celebrated, and supported, and it's a joy to see it happening.

He masterfully manipulates the shot and the sound to construct a world where it is always night. I have not felt so immersed in a movie for a long time, to the point where I felt almost like I myself was hypnotized by the vampire's spell.

            "review": "Robert Eggers made a significant impression with his 2015 directorial debut \"The Witch\", and has continued to impress me since. A reimagining of \"Nosferatu\" at his helm seemed like a dream come true, and after many years, it finally came to fruition with somewhat mixed results.As with the original 1922 film and Werner Herzog's surreal 1979 remake, Eggers mostly honors the source material here. The original film itself was a blatant derivative of \"Dracula,\" so anyone who knows the bones of that classic story will more or less already have the lay of the land in terms of what happens in \"Nosferatu\".Firstly, the attention to detail here is impeccable; the period costumes and sets are dazzling, and the cinematography is top-notch, with repeated uses of muted grey nighttime sequences that border on black-and-white (intentional I'm sure, as an ode to the Murnau original). In the latter act, as rats and plague take over the streets, there is a palpable sense of rot that is highly effective. Given that Eggers has proven his excellence in these departments with his previous films, it is no surprise that the finer details and visuals are uniformly stunning.As far as performances are concerned, we have a strong cast here. Lily-Rose Depp (whom I'd never seen in anything prior to this) gave a formidable performance as the haunted Ellen Hutter, who is pursued by Count Orlok (Bill Skarsgard), a malevolent vampire whose connection to her is emboldened when her husband Thomas (Nicholas Hoult) is assigned to handle estate matters for the Count. Willem Dafoe is as spunky as ever here as an occult expert who attempts to help the Hutters, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Emma Corrin give effective performances as the Hardings, friends of the Hutters who oversee the troubled Ellen while Thomas travels to Orlok.All of these aforementioned elements give the film a real leg up, and approximately the first half of it (largely consisting of Thomas's travels into Transylvania and first encounter with Orlok) are engrossing and beautifully contrasted with Ellen's \"melancholic\" (and eventually possession-like) episodes back in urban Germany. However, once the story returns its focus to the city, the film seems to stall its momentum. One of the notable differences in this reimagining is that the focus revolves more around the Ellen character (aptly named \"Lucy Harker\" in Herzog's version) and the Hardings, but the unfortunate thing is that it never feels like the audience gets to know them any better for it. This is especially so in the case of Ellen, whose character has a slightly different spin in Eggers's screenplay, specifically in terms of her relationship to Orlok. The result feels like something of a missed opportunity, and the proverbial stake is driven in even further when one considers the film's running time, which is considerably longer than both the 1922 and 1979 versions, and yet those films often feel more involved. There is a strange amorphousness about the 2024 version's latter half that left it feeling enervated, especially against the ominous and suspenseful first hour.The film's conclusion will hold no surprises for those who already know the previous films, but Eggers's staging of it is nonetheless spectacular and visually effective--and this is a fact that remains true about the film as a whole. Unfortunately, it does stumble a bit in the latter half as it seems to attempt to expand the material without ever fully reaching a satisfactory fever pitch. All that being said, the film is a gothic visual marvel in its own right, upheld by stunning cinematography and uniformly solid performances. It is imperfect, but it is a showstopper in more ways than one. 7/10.",

The visuals are truly striking and memorable; the shadowy hand across the German town of Wisburg where it takes place or the image of Nicholas Hoult's Thomas walking in a snow forest.: impeccable.The performances are - mostly - fantastic. I was struck by how likable Aaron Taylor Johnson was here; he gives perhaps the best performance of his career in this movie. Willem Dafoe, Nicholas Hoult, Ralph Ineson, Emma Corrin...are all great.Lily Rose-Depp delivers a star making performance in this film for sure, but is she really THAT much better than Nell Tiger-Free in this year's First Omen? They do very similar things, but one movie came out in April and is a horror prequel and the other is a prestige December release from acclaimed director Robert Eggers. I wouldn't normally bring up a \"comparative\" performance, but given how similar these are, I can't help it.And the reason I do that is...her character - Ellen - is not written particularly well. Rose-Depp can do a mean possession, but there isn't much to her character beyond that, as opposed to what I saw from Free in The First Omen.I also feel mixed things about Bill Skarsgård's Count Orlock. As usual, Skarsgård is incredible from a purely performative aspect and truly melts away into the role. However, the movie's interpretation of Orlock didn't work for me at all; his goofy accent and moustache, his copious screen time, and overbearing dialog was more funny than intimidating. You can't have a character deemed \"worse than evil,\" and have him give off Count Chocula vibes. I'm sorry. This is one scenario where less is decidedly more and the amount of time we see Orlock actively hurts the film.But the worst thing about Nosferatu is its pacing, editing, and storytelling. The film has a nightmarish, disorienting vibe in the beginning - which makes sense - and then completely abandons this tone by the second half, becoming far more conventional. In a sense, I kind of wish this movie stuck to its weirdness a bit more; it really should've gone HARDER, but I'm fairly certain studio interference got in the way.It also doesn't really convey information all too well, with confusing editing that puts scenes out of place and lines of - already somewhat hard to understand - dialog intended to convey MAJOR plot points. (Two scenes stick out to me: one where Ellen and Tom are arguing only for it to cut in a way that implies she's going with him to Romania, but they just go his friend's house, and another where his \"night\" at Count Orlock's house is just bereft of any tension or intrigue, because the shots are compiled so confusingly).The film starts off shockingly quickly, giving us no moment to breathe and soak in the world we're seeing on screen. It hits the ground running yet feels simultaneously too long and too rushed.We barely learn anything about our characters and as such, I struggle to see what this Nosferatu is even supposed to be about. The subject matter as presented is ripe for themes like female emancipation, sexual desire, the darker aspects of humanity (stuff that's mentioned), but the movie never gets a chance to really explore any of this.So, while I don't think Nosferatu is a BAD movie by any means, it doesn't accede to anything beyond \"just fine\" to me right now. A technically brilliant, well acted, but ultimately, kind of tepid story.",

However, for Robert Eggers' Nosferatu, after viewing it in it's entirety, it is the only word that comes to mind.Eggers has constructed this film meticulously, with a precision seen in very few directors these days. Heck, more so than any previous effort he's put to screen. You can tell he enjoys working with a bigger budget and he know what to do with it as well. Lavish, gothic set design and costumes across the board. Wonderful special FX, both CG and practical makeup. The cinematography was insane. Sweeping camera shots and uncomfortable closeups, all framed in a 35mm letterbox format. It was a spectacle worth the wait, especially on the IMAX screen I saw it on.The acting was phenomenonal. Lily Rose-Depp should win awards for her all out performance. Both horrific and touching all at the same time. Willem Dafoe provided some much needed spice for the second half. Without his character, the film would've slipped a star as the story starts getting a little long winded towards the end. My only gripe with the cast was Bill Skarsgård as Count Orlok. I felt he could've played into the character's sensitivity a bit more. He was cold hearted, yes, but he did still have love in his heart.The story, adapted from both Dracula and Nosferatu... but mostly Nosferatu, was very well written. With dialog that felt natural and authentic to the time period, another one of Eggers specialty, the film flowed rather nicely and almost transports you to that time and place. Impressively, when the film does eventually start gettint bogged down a bit, Eggers makes sure to pick things right back up again to never keep the audience bored, and with a film like this that could've happened easily.Overall, a pretty great adaptation of a classic story. Equal parts horror and mystery, and a bittersweet ending that almost made me cry. I loved it, and a nice addition to Robert Eggers' growing filmography.4 coffins out of 5.",

Nicholas Hoult is commanding in the Jonathan Harker role and it's clever to cast Willem Dafoe in the Van Helsing role since he played Count Orlock in 1999's much better Shadow of The Vampire, but this ultimately lacks bite.",

But his take on Nosferatu just didn't land for me.The pacing was painfully slow, to the point where it felt like it was dragging for the sake of atmosphere rather than tension. And while I can appreciate deliberate storytelling, this just felt uninspiring, like it was going through the motions without that signature spark Eggers usually brings to his projects.To make matters worse, I couldn't stop seeing Dr. Robotnik from Sonic the Hedgehog every time Nosferatu was on screen. It's probably not fair to the film, but the resemblance was so distracting that I found myself more amused than unsettled.Ultimately, Nosferatu lacked the sharp, visceral energy that made Eggers' previous work so compelling.

I expected more daring and original filmmaking decisions considering the director.As it started off, I was feeling the Robert Eggers effect. Count Orlok is truly terrifying when we first meet him in his castle. He's mysterious and creepy and compelling-in two places at once and his voice somehow booming and quiet at the same time. It made my skin crawl. Nicholas Hoult's convincing utter terror increased my fear and anxiety.But by the time Orlok reaches \"Germany,\" (which incidentally didn't exist yet as a country in the year 1838, despite the film being set there--it would have made more sense to say \"Prussia\" or \"modern day Germany\"), he's lost almost all his sinister effect. Keep in mind, this happens quite early on in the movie.Orlok becomes too visible and physical and real. Rather than this ancient, otherworldly, unknown figure, he becomes this almost comical man/creature with a silly mustache. By the end of the movie, his makeup looks just like that-makeup. Close up and in the bright light, his \"undead\" skin looks like a rubber suit with holes. By the last shot of the film, I had to keep myself from laughing out loud because of how silly he looked.My other major complaint with this film was the lack of exposition and character development. I simply did not care about these characters. Lily-Rose Depp gave a good physical performance, but the film could have benefitted from fewer \"fits\" on her part and more time providing a backstory, thereby making us invested in the characters.I much prefer Coppola's 1992 Dracula to this, and it's not like that's one of my favorite films. It does a much better job telling this story.",

            "review": "Greetings again from the darkness. My first exposure to Count Orlok was in a film class at the University of Texas. We were shown a portion of director FW Murneau's 1922 silent film, NOSFERATU: A SYMPHONY OF HORROR. I was mesmerized with the look of the film and especially with Max Schreck as Orlok. While growing up, I fawned over other vampire movies - Bela Lugosi, Lon Chaney Jr, Christopher Lee, and even Frank Langella - but I never again saw anything like Schreck's Orlock. And yes, over the years, vampires have become frequent subjects of movies and even TV shows, and \"Nosferatu\", based on the original Bram Stoker story from 1897 spawned NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE (1979, directed by Werner Herzog, starring Klaus Kinski) and NOSFERATU (2023, directed by David Lee Fisher, starring Doug Jones). My anticipation soared when it was announced that the extraordinarily creative filmmaker Robert Eggers (THE WITCH, 2015; THE LIGHTHOUSE, 2109; THE NORTHMAN, 2022) would be basing his version on Henrik Galeen's script from the 1922 original.At its core, the story is a gothic tale of a woman haunted by the terrifying vampire obsessed with her. The \"her\" is Ellen Hutter played by Lily-Rose Depp (WOLF, 2021, and yes she's Johnny Depp's daughter). Ellen's husband is Thomas Hutter played by Nicholas Hoult (familiar with the look of this genre via WARM BODIES, 2013, and RENFIELD, 2023). When Thomas' job takes him out of town, friends Friedrich Harding (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Anna Harding (Emma Corrin, DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE, 2024) invite Ellen to stay with them. It turns out the work Thomas is assigned is a real estate transaction with a mysterious recluse named Count Orlok. You may have experienced a bad real estate deal in your life, but it's nothing like this one.When it becomes apparent that Ellen's trauma is not merely nerves, but rather an evil spiritual presence, the expertise of Professor Albin Eberhart von Franz is sought in an attempt to gain some control. The professor is played by Willem Dafoe, who once portrayed the aforementioned Max Schreck in SHADOW OF A VAMPIRE (2000). Playing Count Orlok this time is Bill Skarsgard, who you likely recall was superb as Pennywise the Dancing Clown in IT (2017) and IT CHAPTER TWO (2019). Skarsgard's actual features are undetectable here, and especially jarring is his voice that truly sounds from another world (supposedly months of training). His Orlok is a true and memorable presence.Eggers' film looks stunning and gorgeous and creepy. The opening sequence is fascinating and everything one could ask for in how a vampire horror movie appears on screen. He surrounded himself with previous collaborators: Director of Photography Jarin Blaschke, Production Designer Craig Lathrop, Costume Designer Linda Muir, Film Editor Louis Ford, and Composer Robin Carolan. It's an excellent team and one that excels at every step. My only issue with the film comes down to the cast. Lily-Rose Depp has the perfect look for the character, yet her torment never quite works. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and (the usually stellar) Willem Dafoe both seem to be showboating as if attempting to stand out in a movie dominated by a fearsome creature. It pains me to say that the cast (other than Skarsgard) simply take away some of the impact that the film should have had. Despite this, the film is lyrical, mystifying, and absolutely glorious in its look.Opens in theaters on December 25, 2024.",

In the new 'Nosferatu,' Robert Eggers introduces an off-putting new look for Count Orlok, but Nosferatu (2024) is an unnecessary retelling of Murnau's original film wrapped in mediocrity. It reflects a trend of nostalgia and reboots. Innovation takes a backseat to reverence in the foreground. This is an exercise in indulgence that only the MMXXV Generation will enjoy. Visually, the film is overblown in its impressionistic palette. Coppola's Dracula was visually more imposing, combining opulent gothic imagery with operatic intensity. Herzog's Nosferatu (1979) had more haunting, austere beauty. And Carl Dreyer's Vampyr (1932) was more dreamlike.",

It's a remake of the classic German 1922 silent horror film, which I highly recommend to film lovers. Despite not containing dialogue and being definitely not scary by today's standards, that film was still engaging, compelling, and well-made for its time, and it's probably aged as well as a film over a century old possibly could aspire to. With regards to Eggers' previous films, I enjoyed \"The Witch\" and \"The Lighthouse\" but wasn't as fond of \"The Northman.\" I thought that this film was fine, but it doesn't elevate itself above the original much.Despite my mixed feelings on the film overall, absolutely no one can deny that Eggers is an excellent craftsman at creating detailed period worlds. The production design and cinematography of 19th-century Germany are impeccable, as is the score, costume design, and editing. He knows how to create an excellent sense of atmosphere in his films, and while the film isn't that scary, he still ensures there is a general atmosphere of moodiness and impending dread. From those perspectives, the film is most certainly well-made. But unfortunately, the film's story doesn't feel any more unique, any more profound, or any more interesting than the 1922 original film. The characters aren't especially well-developed, and Eggers' juxtaposition of more serious lead performances (Nicholas Hoult and Lily-Rose Depp) with more campy supporting performances (Williem Dafoe, and to a lesser degree Emma Corrin and Aaron Taylor-Johnson) can sometimes come off as uneven or even a bit superficial. The film's runtime occasionally drags and feels a bit \"been there, done that.\" Ultimately, while I admire the superb aesthetics of this remake, I prefer the 1922 original and wish Eggers had done something to elevate its story and characters a bit. 6/10.",

That's why 'Warfare', the latest and arguably best A24 film I've seen in a long while, floored me. This isn't some patriotic puff piece. It's raw, visceral, and deeply uncomfortable in all the right ways.Co-directed by Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza (a former Navy SEAL whose real-life experience forms the backbone of the story), 'Warfare' drops you headfirst into the chaos of a mission gone sideways in 2006 Ramadi (Iraq). There's no time for character backstories or emotional flashbacks. You're in the dirt with these men, hearing the crack of gunfire, the ragged breathing, the frantic comms - every heartbeat of the film is felt in your chest. Real war, as this film so powerfully reminds us, isn't medals and glory. It's blood, guts, and a harrowing sense of hopelessness.The cast - most notably D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Cosmo Jarvis, and Will Poulter - bring a haunting realism to their roles. You don't watch them; you endure alongside them. And that's what elevates 'Warfare' into something more than cinema. It's an experience. A brutal, brilliantly made, and emotionally devastating experience.Any loss of life in war is a failure - of diplomacy, of leadership, of humanity. This film doesn't flinch from that truth. It holds your gaze and says: look at what we do to each other.A masterpiece. Uncompromising and unforgettable. If you can, see it in a theatre. The sound design alone is worth the ticket - each echoing explosion and muffled breath immerses you deeper into the dread-soaked trenches of reality. 'Warfare' doesn't just show war.

There are no names to remember. No home to long for. No cinematic scaffolding to hold onto. What's left is the brutal machinery of combat - dry, immediate, procedural.This is not the psychological descent of Apocalypse Now, nor the trembling humanism of Saving Private Ryan. It's more like being waterboarded with dust, sound, and confusion.The camera is unflinching - tight, reactive, often handheld but never \"shaky-cam\" chaos. It moves with the soldiers, but never sentimentalizes them. There's no slow-mo. No meditative framing. Just bodies moving through smoke, clearing rooms, capturing buildings. The lens doesn't find beauty in destruction - it avoids it entirely. The few wide shots we get are just to show how small they are. How futile it all looks from a distance. The sound design is relentless: radios crackling over one another, gunfire echoing through narrow alleyways. There is almost no score, and when music does appear (Low's Dancing and Blood) it's droning, ghostly, anti-heroic. It haunts rather than elevates. The production design is chillingly effective. Everything feels lived-in and long-dead at the same time. You can smell the ash, feel the heat radiating off the concrete. The environments aren't stylized, they're decayed, abandoned, half-real. It feels like the war has already happened, and this is just the residue.One of the final moments, set to the droning nightmare of Low's Dancing and Blood, shows a blurry portrait of an Iraqi family seconds before their home is destroyed. Not for shock. Not for plot. But because that is war-it happens, and then it's gone, and the image remains, smeared and indistinct.Civil War framed the ethics of capturing violence. Warfare removes the frame entirely. There is no image here to interpret - just presence. Just event.It's also one of the most immersive war films I've ever seen, precisely because it refuses to explain itself. The film doesn't care if you're lost. It wants you to be. Questions pile up. None are answered. Context is treated like luxury, one the characters (and audience) don't get.By the final sequence, you feel exhausted - not thrilled, not moved - just emptied out. And then the film has the audacity to end on one word:\"Why?\"But it doesn't ask it to provoke. It asks it like a ghost would. Like a memory does. It's not a question. It's an echo.Warfare is not a film you watch. It's something you survive.9/10.P. S\nHaving experienced Warfare in Dolby Atmos, I must emphasize how sonically overwhelming the film's opening sequence is - a moment of almost euphoric surrealism, as the soldiers lose themselves in the pulsating rhythm of Call on Me, the bass resonating so powerfully it felt like the theater roof was coming down. It's a scene of unexpected levity and collective joy, rendered with hypnotic energy and tonal audacity. Precisely this striking contrast - between the almost absurd vitality of the prologue and the film's emotionally pulverizing, desolate conclusion - marks one of the boldest and most jarring juxtapositions in recent cinema.",

Garland is in love with slow-motion muted scenes portraying soldiers being shell shocked. You have to sit through at least 20 minutes of that. There really is no plot and unlike its name and the trailer it is not about combat and all it does is portray the horrors of war.Same as Garlands last bust, Civil War. The title and trailer talk about another USA civil war but it was all about the unrealistic actions of a couple of combat photographers. Don't believe the high user reviews. Those are most likely fake. This director is a bust.",

            "review": "A masterclass in tension and sound design. A visceral, gut wrenching, unrelenting war film experience.This film absolutely deserves an Oscar nod for its sound design, my ears are still ringing, but in the best way possible. It's not for the faint of heart. Rarely has the raw horror of war been depicted with such intensity; I haven't felt this shaken since Saving Private Ryan. The theatrical experience is essential, this soundscape demands a massive screen. The gunfire alone rivals Heat in realism and impact.Those expecting a conventional narrative should adjust their expectations. This isn't a traditional hero's journey, it's an immersive, boots-on-the-ground depiction of a team navigating a chaotic operation where, even when everything is done right, everything can still go catastrophically wrong.Watching this, my respect for our military deepened tenfold. The courage it takes to step into such situations is beyond comprehension, and the professionalism of the operators is portrayed with remarkable authenticity. This film didn't just entertain, it inspired me to be a better leader, a better friend.This is the film I wanted Civil War to be, and I wouldn't be surprised if Alex Garland felt the same. It offered a deeper understanding of PTSD and the brotherhood forged in combat. The emotional and psychological toll is palpable, yet never overplayed.This is not just a film, it's an experience. I'm already planning to see it again in theaters. I'm genuinely curious if my heart rate ever dropped below 130 bpm. As a filmmaker who dreams of tackling a military story one day, I found this both intimidating and inspiring.So. Well. Done.",

            "review": "There have been anti-bellicose films since the early days of cinema. You can trace a throughline from All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), to Paths of Glory (1957), and Platoon (1986). As the U. S. has extracted itself from decades-long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, more reflective films have started to emerge on those conflicts. While we've seen some modern anti-bellicose films like The Hurt Locker (2008), the genre has more often leaned toward propagandistic works such as Lone Survivor (2013), 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi (2016), or 12 Strong (2018). With time and distance, however, a more nuanced perspective is developing-one less interested in glorification or recruitment. We now see stories exploring overlooked aspects, such as the treatment of translators in Guy Ritchie's The Covenant (2023), and more recently, the visceral helplessness felt by soldiers in Warfare (2025).Warfare attempts to recreate, as faithfully as possible, a harrowing day in 2006 during the Battle of Ramadi, when a platoon of Navy SEALs was pinned down in a building. The platoon includes commander Erik (Will Poulter), head of comms Ray (D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai), sniper Elliot (Cosmo Jarvis), and soldiers Sam (Joseph Quinn) and Macdonald (Michael Gandolfini), among others.Directed by Alex Garland, following his similarly themed Civil War (2024), and co-directed by Ray Mendoza-one of the real soldiers portrayed in the film (played by Woon-A-Tai)-Warfare adopts a stripped-down, technical approach. There is no soundtrack to steer viewers' emotions, no hand-holding through military jargon, and minimal expository dialogue about the characters or their mission. We're dropped into a scenario where the soldiers are tasked with securing a compound as an observation post, and from there, the situation escalates-their primary objective quickly becoming sheer survival.With Garland's sharp directorial style and Mendoza's commitment to authenticity, Warfare avoids portraying the U. S. military as a glorified, video-game-like experience. The first act centers on the monotony of war-our characters mostly wait, bored but hyper-aware. When combat finally breaks out, Garland keeps the camera locked inside the house, emphasizing a suffocating sense of claustrophobia. Brief drone thermal images occasionally orient the viewer, but for the most part, the firefight is disorienting and tense. The soldiers fire out blindly, unsure if their shots land, spending most of their time hunkered down. A significant portion of the film focuses on the gruesome injuries sustained and the frantic, desperate efforts of fellow platoon members. Ideology fades quickly, replaced by a primal will to survive.However, Warfare does fall into a familiar trap of many American war films: it centers the suffering of U. S. soldiers while sidelining the pain of local civilians and collaborators. In the film, the platoon occupies the home of two Iraqi families, who are forcibly confined to a single room and largely ignored. Only in a final lingering shot do we see an acknowledgment of their experience, but by then, they feel like shallow afterthoughts rather than co-victims. Similarly, the local translators embedded with the platoon are given short shrift. Though the film briefly shows them being dismissed, berated, and even used as human shields during an evacuation, this disturbing thread is dropped and never revisited. It's a missed opportunity, especially when contrasted with Guy Ritchie's The Covenant, which centers its narrative around the complex relationships between soldiers and translators. The idea that Warfare is \"only about the American soldiers\" doesn't excuse this neglect-just a few more scenes could have offered a more balanced and humane perspective.The cast features an ensemble of rising stars-almost like a who's-who list of \"Top 10 Actors to Watch.\" Poulter, Quinn, and Jarvis shine with charisma despite limited character development. Charles Melton also impresses in a small but commanding role. Some of the other actors, however, feel a bit green: Woon-A-Tai seems out of his depth at times, and Gandolfini's range still feels confined to familiar \"wise guy\" territory. That said, the film's focus on physical endurance and survivalism means deep character work isn't central, and more instinctual, visceral performances prove effective.Warfare is a compelling anti-bellicose film, grounded in technical precision and immersive tension. Its dedication to realism and its refusal to glamorize war are commendable. While the marginalization of civilians and translators remains a significant flaw, the film succeeds in offering a grim, unflinching look at modern combat-a soldier-centric, rightfully distressing experience.",

Some criticism of the film is that there was no story plot or character arcs but when the film ends, it's apparent that the Iraqis and the American soldiers are left with the trauma when everything suddenly stops and the violence has ended.

Alex Garland has done that successfully before-Ex Machina and Civil War were both bold and thought-provoking. But Warfare falls flat. In striving for an ultra-realistic portrayal of modern combat, it forgets to tell an engaging story. Where Civil War had a message that built tension and urgency, Warfare simply meanders. There's no emotional anchor, no narrative drive. If you want to understand warfare, go and watch a good Ken Burns documentary. It will do a better job-and probably contain more suspense.",

The former however was really a depiction of the Wild West with ROE (rules of engagement) and TTPs (tactics techniques and procedures); folks were learning this new environment that didn't exist. Admittedly I'm a little biased because I spent a number of years supporting operators in this community, but watching this movie really hit me. This movie completely understands what we as service members care about and potentially go through in horrible circumstances. The movie throws a middle finger to narrative and just gives you the story as a handful of men experienced that day with no real bias. As far as accuracy I have to say they really hit the nail on the head! Comms saying 0 and not O(the letter), blood sweeps, and taking a knee one someone if you don't have a tourniquet are so fundamental to us, and it's the little details we appreciate for remembrance.

I can't stress enough how important it is to see this movie and if you have the ability, see it on the largest screen possible. I was transported to a place I hope I never have to experience and have even more respect for the men and women that defend our country. This will sit at the upper echelons of war adaptations...

Uncomfortably.They're foreign soldiers holding civilians in their own home at gunpoint, surrounded by a community trying to push them out. Whether the locals are rescuers or rebels depends on your perspective - and Garland refuses to give you one.There's no soaring score. No rousing speeches.

Script is almost non-existent. The CGI is noticeable. ZERO re-watch quality. I'm just a bit baffled as to why he made this...It started off well. I really liked the start of this and I didn't feel it slow .The soldiers hiding out in the civilian house with the enemy outside tension building, I found very engaging and a good initial set-up. But when the action happens the movie doesn't really go anywhere. It's just an immersive experience into frontline warfare. Garland's a big gamer so why not develop this into VR instead? Why make it a movie?I swear almost every war movie now has to rip-off the Spielberg shell-shock scene\nof Tom Hanks on the beach in Saving Private Ryan. Garland copies it here and it goes on too long.There's no music so there's no tension build up or memorable moments involving characters you actually care about. It's similar to American Sniper & Black Hawk Down, but I actually think there both better films than this. This doesn't feel like a film , it feels like a U. S. recruitment video for the military.I mean I get it. Depict war as raw and as real as it is. Salute to the hero's, but then do that as a TV documentary (which I think would've worked better) not as a movie. At least then you'd get some insightful interviews from the Navy Seals, and you'd care more for the characters. Then insert the dramatization/reenactments.A positive I will give it is the sound design. It was really effective and immersive, but overall don't waste your money on this.",

It is art captured on film. This movie is a bright spot for all of the stars who worked on it.Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he's a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing. That's a shame because he is a talented actor that isn't afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays. That is quite rare in the A-list world. Morgan Freeman is a great actor. You can always count on him to do what he does best which is play a wise veteran that has seen it all. Kevin Spacey is another great actor that has great range and really puts life and personality into his characters.The real talent of this movie, excluding the actors that brought it to life, is the director David Fincher and the writer Andrew Kevin Walker. Fincher's talents for making a visually stunning film are now well known and he often brings a dark patina to his work. Andrew Kevin Walker must have some incredible demons living inside him. Either that or one hell of an imagination for bringing the intricate story of Seven and the plan of John Doe to life.John Doe's plan really is twisted and I won't be spoiling it here. Suffice to say I have never seen so evil and complicated a plan in a movie before or since. The cinematography of the film is dark but beautiful and throughout the film it is either night or raining or both except for two very brief moments. It is such an emotional movie that you can't keep from being caught up in what is happening. Do you understand and sympathize with what John Doe is doing or do you think him a mad killer that must be stopped.Bottom Line: If you haven't had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it.

According to Se7en, our culture is drifting through darkness. The mouthpiece for this thematic undercurrent is Somerset, a literate man who also happens to be a detective, a man who can read a clue (\"This isn't going to be a happy ending\") or Dante's Inferno with equal aplomb. He even provides the film's final thematic statement with a quote from Hemingway. His quirkiness, perhaps the outgrowth of a brilliant mind, is no worse than that of any prophet or seer of old, those harbingers of Biblical insight whom others always find kooky and offbeat. He is not well loved for his cynical, pessimistic outlook (such that his consuming motivation is to retire and get out of town). However, by the end it becomes clear that it is Somerset who sees our dark world with the prophet's particular clarity. (It is left to his partner Mills to find this out the hard way).Working on us to reinforce this world as Somerset sees it is the film's astounding mise-en-scene, a disturbing film-noir setting developed by director David Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji. Flashlights barely illuminate the slimy walls of the roach-infested tenement of one victim and the dark bedroom of another. Rain pours down in buckets. Bird's-eye-view shots of downtown (the city is never named- a generic, everyman's kind of place) show dingy, sooty rooftops and grimy streets. Only the film's closing scene is in bright sunlight, which by then only serves as ironic counterpoint to what we see happening.This is Somerset's vision; both inhabited and described by him. He finds a surprising fellow traveler in, not his partner, but the elusive killer John Doe. Doe shares the vision and provides an unsettling echo to the rumblings and teachings of Somerset. If one looks at life through the Somerset lens, one must admit that John Doe has a valid point. He and Somerset have arrived at the same conclusion, the difference between them being how they have responded. (Somerset longs to escape to some otherworldly realm in the country. Doe has taken action.)Though gripping and fast moving, this is not an action film. It holds our interest through the workings of horror and mystery: a stark, film-noir detective piece. Except for one tense pursuit through halls and alleys in pouring rain, as well as the bit of ending action, there is surprisingly little violence. We see each murder, save two, after the fact, as a crime scene. This only makes the final act that much more suspenseful.This is a very tight film. Elements within: dialogue, actions, lighting, setting, all of these tend to reinforce one another to paint a solid picture. It is a perverse logic that makes the final and seventh sin complete perfectly the circle of events begun with the first.",

Both actors displayed striking performances that are so sharp and realistic sometimes you have to remind yourself that's its all acting.David Fincher's masterpiece really gives us an opportunity of a lifetime, maybe it's one that we don't all wish to share, but by seeing this movie you will experience a glimpse of the horrors that this world is filled with, and a small piece of mind of a man who you only prey you never have to meet.Brad Pitt successfully proves to us that he's not just a pretty face on screen, and that he sinks into his character so well, that you can walk off after the film finishes classifying him as a pretty darn good actor.You wouldn't expect anything else from Morgan Freeman because it's perfectly obvious that this guy was born to play the roles of the smart detective.David Fincher's timeless directing and memorable filming captures all the goods that this film has to offer and will undoubtedly leave you shocked and begging for more films like this. Seven is a step into the harsh realities of life, a realistic portrayal of two detectives investigation into the un-describable horrific world murder, and the darkest realms of the human soul.We can only prey for more classic memorable work from Mr. Fincher and for those future directors who are intent on making a gothic, psychological thriller, make sure you sit down and watch Seven with a pen and paper ready to take notes.",

The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and  mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It's  very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the  meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting,  or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer  Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere.  Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced  and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some  obvious cliché's. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and  Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different  in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them  such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play  more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey  truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and  chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of  them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive.  Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police  captain.

The two characters are also brilliantly acted by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt (probably his best performance).There's one odd flaw in the film - about half-way through, I found that I had learned to \"expect the unexpected\" from the film, which meant that the rest of the film was predictable in a bizarre way - simply decide where the expected move would be, and then expect the unexpected move instead. The most obvious instance of this is in the finale itself, which could be guessed at least 5 minutes ahead of time.Normally, this would be a formula for disaster - but fortunately, the high quality of the film-making twists the film into an edge-of-the-seat suspenseful waiting game as we watch with horror the one cop's encounter with the insanity of pure evil.I didn't want to admire this film (to be honest, I dislike Brad Pitt something fierce), but I'm afraid I must - very professionally made, it delivers its promised suspense all the way.",

It does not entertain a sensible mind. It does not uplift. It has not humor, no fun, no moral. It is morbid, depressing, meaningless. But it is not meaningless like, say, life. Life's meaninglessness has a depth, it is somber. The meaninglessness of this movie is like a small child killing a white rabbit - wanton, senseless, rabid.What did you learn from this movie? What did you enjoy? What moved you? Nothing unless you admire gore and violence per se. Yes, the acting, especially of KS, was superb. But I do not see any glamor in superbly acting the part of a mad killer. The mad killer can do it himself.Anyways, I am rambling; but after a movie like this, you are at a loss for words. You wonder what kind of people spend a million dollar on a movie like this. You wonder what kind of people go to watch it.

With only a small handful of minor flaws -- the overly familiar retiring cop/young cop pairing; the awful \"I'm taking you off the case!\" cliche seemingly required by the genre; one giant lapse in logic in the downward spiral toward the conclusion that cannot be revealed without ruining the script's gruesome surprise -- Seven typically keeps its viewers imprisoned in their seats with a combination of morbid fascination and abject fear.

What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill's uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much. Overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie.

The disgusting crimes combined with the general darkness and mumbled dialogue made the whole film depressing and hard to care about.As for the ending, it only served to remove any suspense that had been building up.

Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10.\nParasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there.",

            "review": "In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: \"I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.\"The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. \"It's easy to be nice when you're rich,\" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to \"metaphors,\" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the \"Indians\") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage.",

As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times.

            "review": "Huge Oscar Winner?! What a JOKE!There's no way or simply not enough to convince me that this 4-member family could have so easily conspired a big scam to wreck a rich family. The two screenplay writers, one of them was the director Bong, simply borrowed the mass majority feelings of the 99% struggling Koreans who deeply hate the upper 1% rich class people in Korea and made up a story that rendered a catharsis masturbation-like feel-good opportunity for the poor, a self-righteous, self-justified, self-indulgent revenge on the rich class.At the beginning of this movie, this lowlife 4-member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition, the husband/father was unemployed for a very long time, the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman, the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times. This helpless and hopeless family couldn't simply become a well practiced con-artist family overnight. If they were such great scammers, they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time. They were just like you and me who don't have money to afford a dignified basic living standard. They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con-artist so easy and so soon.The most shameful scenario was the screenplay writers/director who made the rich people looked so stupid, naive, emotional fragile and so easily to be conned, they completely overlooked the fact why and how rich people became rich. The differences between the rich and the poor are many, but usually, it's because the rich people are smarter, more intelligent, more cunning, 1,000 times sharper than the poor, they are not so easy to be manipulated, conned, scammed, or swindled, otherwise they wouldn't become rich and successful. Yet this stereotyped shallow screenplay simply overlooked these facts and made the rich husband and wife so stupid and so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers who didn't even know how to make a basic living or how to pass the college exams.The screenplay made the rich wife a fragile, naive, shallow emotional wreck, but totally refused to admit that rich wives usually are split-hair sharp, otherwise they'd not be able to handle their social status. The husband in this movie also showed that he's a hardworking super smart self-made businessman and entrepreneur, he should not be so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers. Yet this movie, again, simply overlooked the realistic fact and made these couple an easy moronic target by the scammers.In summary: Zero Probability & Highly Unlikely! The long-term helpless 4-member losers were absolutely impossible to become a well-experienced, well-organized, smart grifters/swindlers. How possible these 4 lamers to could br so abruptly, so suddenly become so smart, so organized, so skillful overnight to carry out their scam step by step? It's against the basic logic and absolute impossible.The director/screenplay writers just used the majority poor peoples' hate/resent/bitter feelings against the minority rich people psychology, manipulated the poor audiences to have a catharsis moment in the movie theaters. If the audience in Cannes Film Festival gave a 10-minutes standing ovation, it only showed the majority of the audiences were also the majority poor, they finally got the opportunity to have a small window to vent their bitterness against the rich, so they were so generous to award this one-way street movie the grand prize.I don't know why the Korean movie makers are so obsessed in this kind of con-artist/imposter/swindler/fraud genre movies. Ah-ga-ssi (Handmaiden) (2016) is almost the same like this sucker, but that 2016 movie is even lower and abject than this one, but even that movie spent too much energy on the lesbian love-making scenes, these two movies are basically the same: HIGHLY UNLIKELY AND ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE! SAME CRAP, DIFFERENT TITLE. Only people without any logic thinking ability would enjoy them. To me, both of these two movies are just a torture to watch. There are many other Korean movies all like these two suckers, so I think it's time to call off making such stupid movies.I'm a poor guy, yet I don't hate the rich people but envy them. I'm also a certified lifetime loser but I willingly admit that most of the rich people are definitely smarter than me, there's no way I could manipulate them and con even $0.01 out of their pocket.",

I wasn't sure what to expect and actually planned on being a little disappointed with all the expectations and hype of such an all-star cast.From the moment the opening credits came up, the movie grabbed me by the neck, ripped me out of my seat and didn't let go until the final scene.Each performance is more masterful than the next. Damon was a tour de force as the lead, tapping every ounce of his acting reservoir for this role. Nicholson creates another classic role to add to his already sterling resume. His mob boss would almost steal every scene he was in, if it not for every other actor being so fantastic However, the biggest surprise for me personally came from Leonardo DeCaprio.Having never warmed up to any of his roles or movies, I found myself blown away by him in this. I'm not sure if it was the material he was given, or if DeCaprio has grown this much as an actor, or a combination of both, but he finally won me over with his role in this instant Scorsese classic. Every character is pitch perfect, every scene is right on the money. The plot builds to a crescendo of such dynamic proportions rarely seen on film. I don't want to give too much away, but I'm still shaken from the ride I was taken on.People go to the movies in the hopes that maybe once in a hundred times you get to experience storytelling so masterful and transcendent that it changes the way you view cinema. This is one of those spectacularly perfect times.Forget Taxi Driver. Forget Raging Bull. Forget Goodfellas. As much as I LOVE those movies and as much as they have affected me in my lifetime, The Departed will hands down be Martin Scorsese's Master Work.",

            "review": "Now I know that 'The Departed' is based off of the Hong Kong movie 'WuJianDao', but Scorsese really grabs hold of a great story and brings it to the American Screen. My father grew up in Boston and when we walked out of the theater he couldn't stop talking about how authentic the environment and attitude was. Then there's the acting in which the lead actors (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon) not only give stunningly entertaining performances, but you become engulfed in each one's perspective and dilemmas. The smaller roles that of (Baldwin, Walberg, Sheen) are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from 'The Big Lebowski', by this I mean that their screen time is limited but they make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scene they are in, Alec Baldwin especially. The story itself starts off with the basic intro of the players and the setting, but you'll find yourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting back and forth for the good guys and for the bad guys. If you're a Scorsese fan, which I am, I think you will appreciate this film. You can clearly see the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course the music, it's great to hear \"Gimme Shelter\" again, but \"Comfortably Numb\" played in so well. It's another gangster flick from Scorsese, yet this one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agree Scorsese does gangster films the best; so why not let him. Oscar worthy, the acting I certainly hope; this is DiCaprio's best role since 'The Aviator' which was his best role since 'Gangs of New York', am I seeing a pattern here. But my lasting impression wasn't concerned with the politics of the golden statue; my lasting impression was that I had sat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertaining storytelling. Thank you Mr. Scorsese.",

Not only is it the best film of the year so far, it marks a return to form for Martin Scorsese, and ranks with the likes of GOODFELLAS as being one of the best in his canon of films.I'm a fan of the Hong Kong film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, upon which this is based. While THE DEPARTED keeps the basic structure of the original, it is very much its own movie, so much so that the screenwriter, William Monahan, didn't even watch the original film while adapting its screenplay, thus enabling him to infuse the script with his, and Scorsese's, respective visions.All the actors are first-rate (yes, even Leo, for all you DiCaprio bashers out there), and turn in some of their best performances to date. THE DEPARTED is sure to garner a host of Oscar nods, if not wins, including (hopefully) Scorsese's long-overdue statuette for Best Director. Plus, with actors like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin playing supporting roles, that says a lot about the quality of the film they signed up for! THE DEPARTED is tough stuff, not for the faint-of-heart. That said, it is a must-see for adult viewers who long for intelligent, gritty stories to grace our movie screens once again.",

            "review": "Dare I? Dare I say it? This movie is better than Goodfellas. There, I said it.I saw this latest Scorsese film at an advance screening. Needless to say I was expecting a lot  more than I thought this director (of classics like Taxi Driver but lately of Gangs of New York) would deliver. I was very wrong.Though the exact plot is unimportant, The Departed is about the blurred lines that distinguish good guy from bad guy, and cop from robber, in present-day Boston. With a packed cast (which I need not mention) that includes great supporting roles by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, the acting in the departed is stellar. Living-legend Jack Nicholson flawlessly delivers one of his best performances in years as the execrable mob boss Frank Costello. Nicholson's nuanced acting was so on-point that at times I felt like I was actually about to be shot by the slimy capo.The Departed is nothing short of spectacular. Funnier that most comedies, Scorsese is still able to amplify the bloodshed and meticulously deliver a stunning cinematic achievement.Bravo, Mr. Scorsese; you have outdone yourself.",

            "review": "Excellent. A great, great movie. I saw it last night at a special screening and must say it was a tour de force. Even though Boston is not really a gritty town Scorsese was able to capture a darker side of the city. Coming from that area, I am always concerned when actors put on the local accent as it tends to be distracting rather than supportive. However, with local pros like Damon and Wahlberg they were able to really grab hold of it and not go overboard... most of the time. The true stand out performance has to go to DiCaprio. He has really come into his since hooking up with Scorsese, having scored a number of original performances all of which have expanded his range. He really snagged onto a deep and tragic character and created something that will hopefully be recognized come awards season. One of my favorite aspects was the friendly hostility the characters had for each other. It is a specific trademark that I have never noticed in any other city. In Boston, when you are really close with someone (or not really) it is, more or less, a requirement to bust their balls and shoot cruel insults back and forth in rhythmic banter. That detail was extensively realized in THE DEPARTED and I doubt anybody who was raised outside of the metro Boston area, or at least visited at some point, would find it nearly as hilarious as those who were. As for Scorsese's direction, I think he scored big with this one. While many have criticized that his movies have become more commercial I believe that he has just evolved. There were some classic Scorsese moments here, my favorite being a scene where DiCaprio is alone and packing his things in his apartment. Beautifully cut and stylistically directed. Is it his best effort? No. But it still is truly mesmerizing. He has created something truly special from a city that is highly underrated.",

            "review": "The DepartedThe screenplay: Top NotchThe performances: all-star cast delivering all-star performancesThe music: perfectThe Directing: Martin Scorsese at his finest and that is saying something.Once again Scorsese delivers a film that meets or exceeds the expectations of its audience in nearly every way. There are moments of incredible tension, violence, and drama, moments where characters reveal their vulnerabilities and weakness. Comedic moments and moments of sadness and through it all a multi layered and brilliant story is told by an American film maker who once again proves Harvey Keitel correct when he said, \"Maybe he (Scorsese) got what he deserves--exclusion from the mediocre.\"This film is Scorsese's finest work since Raging Bull, but it is not simply about Martin Scorsese or the amazing screen play by William Monahan, it is more than an amazing score, and great cinematography. While many of the accolades for this film belong to those behind the scenes people who envisioned and directed this film. One would be remiss to not point out the great performances of an all-star cast, many of whom deliver the finest performances of long and storied careers. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon deliver incredible performances.However the performance that stood out for me was Wahlberg, Mark Wahlberg's Sgt. Dignam stole every scene he was in, and he shared screen time with each of the afore mentioned actors. He gets to deliver some of the best lines, and with every scene he leaves the audience wanting more, and anticipating his next scene.Since The Academy has had its collective heads stuck  for so long, mentioning a Scorsese picture and Oscar in the same sentence seems to be a waste of time. That being said I can not say if he will finally win the Oscar that he has deserved for so long, as his major competition (Flags of our Fathers) has yet to be released, I will say that I expect to see Wahlberg nominated for best supporting, and Leo and Damon will be pitted against one another once more, this time for best actor, Monahan will be nominated for writing, and of course Scorsese will be nominated for director. Also, it goes without saying a best picture nomination will be in order for The Departed.That was the long version; the short version is if you like a movie with incredible performances, direction, music and visuals. If you like a layered story that is not formulaic, in short if you appreciate film making and story telling at its finest then see this film. Even with the glowing reviews of myself and others, and the high expectations they will undoubtedly bring I assure you that you will not be disappointed.",

            "review": "Before seeing this, I knew I was in for a treat, given that it's a Scorsese movie, but The Departed was even better than I expected.The acting is outstanding. Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is quite possibly the best performance of his career. Even the people who hate him admit he did a good job. It's turned some haters into fans and my brother who despises him even says he was great. Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson give their best performances since The Talented Mr. Ripley and As Good As It Gets. Mark Wahlberg almost steals the show with the best lines. Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen are good, too.Definitely one of the best films of the 00's. And easily one of the best remakes of all time. It's intense, funny, exciting, suspenseful, superbly acted, violent, has great characters, and has one of the most shocking scenes I've ever seen. And there's not a boring moment in it's two and a half hour running time.The film will most likely be nominated for picture, director and adapted screenplay, and in my opinion, it deserves all three of them. DiCaprio and Wahlberg also deserve nominations.See this as soon as you can.",

Also notable are the performances of Matt Damon (such a great \"bad-guy;\" he really must do stuff like this more often), Leo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson (as always), and Mark Wahlberg (best since Rockstar). However, some in the theater with me who had seen Infernal Affairs did say that Departed did not live up to the original. I have yet to see Affairs, but I honestly believe that Departed was pulled off well enough to really bring in some respectable awards in the upcoming season.",

            "review": "First off, this is an American stylized remake of the Hong Kong hit, Infernal Affairs. I have to give credit to that, a good film. I have seen both Infernal Affairs and The Departed. I personally prefer The Departed, and I think because of one thing: Martin Scorsese. This is the master behind such greats as Taxi Diver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and he's at it again. The film has an all star cast with Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin.The Direction was amazing. (maybe one of the reasons why he won the Oscar for it) I loved how some of the scenes were shot and set up. Especially regarding the Chinatown, and police interrogation scenes, among many others. The film is perfectly set up with intense, suspense scenes while adding in amounts humor at times. It works really well. The script is top notch. (Also Oscar winning) Realistic strong dialogue from scene to scene.Another thing I liked more in The Departed, as opposed to Infernal Affairs, was the acting. DiCaprio really seemed to earn a lot of respect from this role. Here, he takes on the tough guy persona so well. Sure it was known he was a good actor from his Oscar nominated performances in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and The Aviator, but he really takes it to another level here. I can't see anyone else as the character, he fits so perfectly with it. Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg, being Massachusetts natives, also give solid performances, with their natural accents. Nicholson works well in his role, as well. Everyone was extremely solid and everything seemed so real.Set in Boston, The Departed takes in all the Boston like atmosphere. Beautifully shot scenes of the Massachusetts Golden Dome State Capital building is just one part of the landscape. The Dropkick Murphys song \"I'm Shipping up to Boston\" really fits, great use of songs. Scorsese usually works music into his films really well.\"Cops or Criminals. When you're facing a loaded gun what's the difference?\" This quote really represents the film.\" Matt Damon plays a state officer in the Police, working for the crime boss of the area, Frank Costello (Nicholson). While Damon's character can be described as a \"bad guy,\" he is really misunderstood. As a kid, he is sort of mentored into crime business by Costello while Costello becomes the father figure Damon's character never had. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a young guy, coming from a bad, crime ridden family. He's decides to become a police officer to get away from the crime life he's been surrounded by. Taking all this into account, Captain Queenen (Sheen) and Seargent Dignam (Wahlberg) decide to send DiCaprio's character undercover to find out more about the criminal underworld and Costello. With his family's crime record, he fit's perfectly into the situation. Now you have a highly ranked officer working for bad guy, and an undercover cop in the criminal underworld working for the State Police. From here it's an all out suspenseful thrill ride. Who's who? Who's working for who? Who can you trust? Paranoia threatens everyone. Lies. Betrayal. Sacrifice. How far will you take it?At the heart of this film is character development. We really feel for the characters. We feel like we know them. It's really amazing part of this story and film. Tremendous story telling here.This is one of the most entertaining and suspenseful crime/drama's I have seen in a while. While Infernal Affairs, came first, I think The Departed expands on it in so many ways. Really solid crime/drama. Check both out when you get a chance. It's really worth it. 9/10",

            "review": "He has made good musicals (New York, New York), surreal comedies (After Hours), satires (The King of Comedy) and biopics (The Aviator), but Martin Scorsese has never done better than the times he's dealt with life on the streets and gangsters. Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino (and, to some degree, Taxi Driver) are proof of that. It doesn't seem strange, then, that his finest film in over a decade (Goodfellas was released in 1990) sees him return to that familiar ground. With a few changes.The Departed, based on Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs (2002), is Scorsese's first gangster film not to feature Italian-American criminals. In fact, this film is set in Boston, where the Irish rule. One of these \"godfathers\" is Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the man the State Police want the most. After years of investigation, they're finally getting close, thanks to undercover agent Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio). Because of his family (all Irish, all bad), becoming a member of Costello's crew isn't that difficult. Now all Costigan has to do is report to his superiors, Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), who will pass on the information to Ellerby's (Alec Baldwin) Special Investigations Unit. What they don't know is that Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), the most promising element of said unit, has been on Costello's payroll since he was 12. Soon enough, both cops and crooks become aware of the situation, beginning a manhunt that's gonna make the already fragile Billy even more nervous and Costello increasingly crazier.By moving from Hong Kong to Boston, Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have made the first step in ensuring this film will be quite different from its Chinese inspiration. Another significant factor is the running time: a mere 97 minutes for Infernal Affairs, 150 for The Departed. This is due to new characters (Dignam and Costello's henchman Mr French, played by Ray Winstone, were missing in the original) and subplots, such as the one concerning Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), a psychiatrist who gets emotionally involved with both of the moles. But the most crucial difference is in the depiction of the underworld: whereas IA was stylish without being excessive, Scorsese's vision comprises very colorful language (some insults are so creative one might expect Joe Pesci to show up) and, of course, buckets of blood, the last part of the movie proving to be particularly shocking. None of the scenes ever reach the gross-out level of Casino's head-in-the-vice scene, but in pure Scorsese tradition it remains unflinchingly violent (also notable is the music, perfectly setting the mood, scene after scene, alongside Thelma Schoonmaker's impeccable editing).Amidst these brutal surroundings, the director handles a spot-on cast: Baldwin, Sheen and Wahlberg (the latter finally back on form) make good use of their little screen time, Damon fine-tunes the edgier side he showed in The Talented Mr Ripley and the Bourne movies, and Nicholson, playing the villain again at last, delivers another OTT but classy turn (original choice Robert De Niro would probably have played the part with more calm and subtlety). A special mention is needed for Di Caprio: working with Scorsese for the third consecutive time, he has finally found a way to shake off his Titanic image, thanks to a vulnerable, gripping (and arguably career-best) performance.With its clever plot, excellent acting and expert direction, The Departed is without doubt the year's best film so far. If this really is going to be his last gangster film (he has said so), as well as his last studio-endorsed picture, Scorsese can be proud, given the masterpiece he has given us. If only they gave him the Oscar in return...",

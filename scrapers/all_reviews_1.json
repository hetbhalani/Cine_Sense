The original Dexter was absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best shows ever created. It's a thrilling, one of a kind TV show that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. Michael C. Hall is perfect as Dexter and the rest of the supporting cast is just as fantastic. Yes, the ending was terrible but like Game of Thrones, Lost (or any other show with a bad final episode), a few bad episodes at the end doesn't spoil what an overall great show it was and that's what Dexter is...a GREAT show! The ending was so bad they brought back Dexter: New Blood to give it a better ending. Problem is the ending to that was even worse. Now, we're back with Dexter: Resurrection and I love it. I can't get enough of Dexter. I've loved having Dexter back on my tv and this show is really good overall. It's definitely worth watching.",

If you've consumed any media and know anything about how to craft a story, you'd know this is amateur hour for writing. I wrote better stories in grade school.Near Death or Dying Visions Trope? Check.The reformed killer who starts killing again trope? CheckThe brilliant but neurodivergent \"sees things differently\" police person? Check.That's just the first 20 minutes, and it's not every lazy, shortcut writing trick used in that time. It's just awful. My family spent more time making fun of it than watching it.Unless you're just a complete Dexter fanboy and are willing to turn off your ability to think logically, give this tired old rehash a pass.",

            "review": "Dexter: Resurrection marks the third revival of the iconic Showtime series, and surprisingly, it's the most satisfying since the Trinity Killer arc. Picking up weeks after New Blood, Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) awakens from a coma in a New York hospital, having miraculously survived being shot by his son, Harrison. From there, the show dives into familiar territory - but with a fresh setting, sharper writing, and a darker emotional core.Michael C. Hall is magnetic as ever. This isn't the Dexter of Miami Metro or Iron Lake - he's older, more haunted, and emotionally raw. Hall brings a tempered intensity to the role, balancing sardonic wit with genuine pathos. His internal monologues are back, but they're more reflective, less performative. The show leans into Dexter's weariness, making his return feel earned rather than forced.The New York setting is a smart move. The city's anonymity and chaos offer Dexter both cover and temptation. He takes up work as a rideshare driver, blending into the urban sprawl while quietly hunting predators. The cinematography captures the grit and pulse of the city, and the soundtrack - featuring moody tracks like Nick Cave's \"Red Right Hand\" - adds to the show's eerie atmosphere.The supporting cast is stacked. Peter Dinklage plays Leon Prater, a billionaire with a twisted obsession for serial killers. Uma Thurman is his enigmatic enforcer, Charley - cool, lethal, and captivating. Guest stars like Krysten Ritter, Neil Patrick Harris, Eric Stonestreet, and David Dastmalchian play members of a secret society of killers, each bringing a unique flavor to the chaos. Their scenes are some of the most entertaining and disturbing in the series.Jack Alcott returns as Harrison, now working as a bellhop in Midtown. His arc is quietly heartbreaking - a young man trying to outrun his father's legacy while slowly succumbing to the same darkness. His scenes are filled with tension and emotional weight, especially as he begins to show signs of inherited trauma and compulsive behavior.Angel Batista (David Zayas) also returns, adding a nostalgic yet foreboding presence. His pursuit of Dexter adds a layer of suspense that longtime fans will appreciate. The tension between old friends turned adversaries is palpable, and it's clear Batista won't let go easily.Showrunner Clyde Phillips, who helmed the best seasons of the original series, brings a steady hand to Resurrection. The writing is tighter, the pacing more deliberate. The show doesn't shy away from its past - it embraces it, flaws and all. It's self-aware, occasionally pulpy, and often emotionally resonant.Yes, there are plot conveniences and moments that stretch believability. But Dexter has always thrived in that space between logic and lunacy. What matters is that the story feels alive again - messy, macabre, and meaningful.Final Verdict: 10/10\nDexter: Resurrection is a bold, bloody, and brilliantly executed revival. It honors the original while carving out something new. Whether you're a longtime fan or just diving in, this season is a must-watch. Dexter's back - and he's never been sharper.",

I missed Dexter so much and was so excited to hear that it was getting revived for this series, especially with the way New Blood ended. Dexter is easily one of my favorite shows of all-time and one of the few shows I can watch all the way through several times over without getting bored. Dexter: New Blood was actually a pretty good show right up until the ending and Dexter: Original Sin was terrific from beginning to end. Now we have Dexter: Resurrection. So far it's the Dexter we've all come to love. I'd absolutely recommend this to any Dexter fans just to see Michael C. Hall back as Dexter. That's worth watching alone and again, the show itself is really good. Let's just all pray they don't botch the ending like they did with Dexter and New Blood.",

I'm so tired and fed up with the same trope over and over and over again. Of course OF COURSE the bad guy is pale. Of course he is a R motivated pale killer.We know the story now.

They should have ended it there and call it a day but it looks like they still want to milk this franchise even more.This is a terrible idea though, since it's not the Dexter that we all used to know and love. It is trying to be some sort of dark comedy, progressive, political stew and fails miserably. It does not have the darkness and sobriety of the original. Seems to be another show manufactured for \"modern audiences\" and not for Dexter fans.The only good thing about it is Michael C. Hall who still has that dark charm especially when he's narating he's internal thoughts. There are some strange appearances in the show like Uma Thurman and Peter Dinklage which I personally believe were added to the cast just to give it the feeling of a premium show, I don't actually know why they are needed otherwise - they are not actually.Although I only saw the first 2 episodes I think I already made my mind about it unfortunately, I will not be watching the rest of the episodes, it's that bad.If you feel the Dexter nostalgia I recommend you rather watch the first 4-5 seasons of the original show and maybe if you still have time, watch the first season of this and skip this one, it's not worth the time.",

Unfortunately, this series also falls into that category.The first episode was not promising, but the second is a real parody. When a new villain, a new serial killer, enters the scene, it becomes obvious that this is another \"modern movie production\". The dialogue between him and his victim is hilarious. Not that other dialogues are better, but this one is a real parody. If nothing else, at least we can laugh.The police detective duo, male and female, also fit nicely into the whole parody, as the incompetent (of course) new sheriff in the town where Dexter used to live. Add Harrison's love interest to the mix and that's it, the comedy is complete.We watch series and movies for entertainment, not for \"lessons\". But hey, here at least we see at the beginning how things will turn out, so at least we are spared from wasting time, and we can at least give up at the beginning.It's a shame, I really thought this would be better, so I'm giving up because I don't want to waste time on something that wasn't made to entertain the viewer.Everything has become predictable, the good guys, the bad guys, there's simply no point in wasting time anymore.Another failure of the \"modern entertainment industry\" that has almost nothing to do with entertainment anymore.",

Or go even full savage mode and give us summer and winter season releases of seasons like game of thrones did randomly.I hope producers read our approval of their work. They should consider even doing a side story and a different intersecting show like a multiverse where the come to get her with Lumen who dexter trained and is alive and ready to be written into her own vigilante serial killer show following Dexters Code because once she got the taste for blood she couldn't stay away in the mundane marriage life she went back to. The name of the show could be the blood is calling or something. Convos and winks of Dexter doing work as she trys to one day catch up to him. It could spawn a whole never ending legacy. Crime junkies everywhere who watch serial killer documentaries and know of the not so known or famous female serial killers in history.

The problem being, it just becomes a bigger mess, when they keep bringing the story back with untested writers, direction and clearly, out of work actors and actresses.

As a long-time fan of a franchise that has soared to unimaginable heights and stumbled into baffling lows, I sat down to watch with a familiar sense of dread. But episode after episode, that dread was replaced by something else entirely: a dangerous, thrilling sense of hope. This series is, against all odds, living up to the monumental potential of its premise.It's all here: the crushing weight of corporate malfeasance from Weyland-Yutani, the chillingly sterile aesthetic that masks unspeakable horrors, and a tangible, blue-collar grit that made the original films so relatable. This isn't a reboot; it's a masterful expansion, taking advantage of the rich, terrifying story that was always lurking in the background of Hadley's Hope and the doomed voyage of the Nostromo.Crucially, the show demonstrates a profound confidence in its own narrative. It never feels the need to preach or moralize; it simply builds its world, develops its characters, and lets the inherent themes of corporate greed and human fallibility arise organically. The focus remains laser-sharp on telling a damn good story, trusting the audience to connect the dots. It's refreshing to see a production so committed to its craft above all else.This commitment is reflected in the pitch-perfect performances. The acting is superb across the board, and the much-discussed \"boy genius\" character is played with a compelling depth that avoids cliché. The direction feels singular and focused, weaving a seamless flow that makes the generous episode lengths fly by. Everything just works.And that's what scares me.I've been here before. The first few episodes of a brilliant series like Shogun had me hook, line, and sinker, only for the momentum to falter. My one great fear for Alien: Earth is that this singular vision will be diluted, that the directorial duties will be flip-flopped between hands that don't share the same perfect feel for the material, ruining the delicate, terrifying ecosystem they've built.For now, I can only judge what I've seen, and what I've seen is a masterclass in tension, style, and world-building. It respects the intelligence of its audience and the legacy of its source material-a balance that is incredibly hard to strike. This is the show I've been waiting for. This is the 'Alien' series that finally feels like Alien. Please, for the love of Ripley, don't mess it up.",

Unfortunately, what I found was not just a lack of improvement, but a step backwards.The opening scene, clearly inspired by the first film, briefly sparked my nostalgia. But beyond that, the tone and pacing felt more like a generic young adult sci-fi show-almost closer to The 100-than the tense, claustrophobic horror that defines Alien. At times, the story even gave me more of a Peter Pan vibe than anything belonging in the Alien universe.Of course, this is just my personal opinion, but for me, the magic and menace of Alien simply wasn't there. I won't be continuing with the series.Vincent.",

This is close and would have gone 9.5, but didn't see that option.I didn't see the title of the first episode (Neverland) but when I saw it afterwards, let's just say GREAT choice as it fits this episode really well!The music score is well done, the special fx are solid, not overdone, and there is excellent acting throughout. I especially am enjoying the lead female character and that angle of the story.Lastly, you don't have to watch any of the original movies to understand what's going on in this series, it could stand alone and works well even with no prior knowledge of the original movies.9.5 stars!

Ortega transformation into Wednesday seems effortless, she has all the quirks, coldness and mean insults associated with her, but in such an expert hands, Wednesday does not seem cartoonish nor one-dimensional, she is portrayed with incredible depth.The series is also directed by Tim Burton, and his love for the macabre and Hammer Horror us incredibly noticeable here, and so is his dark sense of humor.The supporting cast is incredible as well, specially Emma Myers as Enid, her colorful personality are a surprisingly well match for our color deprived protagonist.If you were a fan of Wednesday Addams before you will love the series, id the character is new to you this series will make you fall for her.A Gothic murder mystery with a twist of irreverent dark humor, there are not enough words to praise this series.",

            "review": "Update season 2 at the bottom:Now, of course, I could've been even more cruel and title this review \"Scooby Doo goes to Hogwarts to meet the X-Men\" but I'm trying not to offend anyone (too much). After all, there is a connection of Scooby Doo and the Addams Family as far back as the 70s.With the promise I made to my 10 year old niece, I forced myself to finish the first season. In the original review I wrote here, I was saying that: \"I'm at episode 3 and it is painful. It was a struggle to watch the first episode, but the more it goes on, the worse it gets.\"But before I (and others) come to conclusions, I (we) need to understand some things clear: This is a coming-of-age series made for the adolescents of today. It is not for adults specifically, it is not R-Rated and most of all, we must understand that the new generation of teenagers are different from the teenagers we were. The difference in generations must be taken into account. After all, those who are fans of the 90s movies (like myself) will also see the 60s series differently, and the 60s fans (such as our parents) will see the 90s movies differently. I'll come to this subject again later in the review.Now my thoughts.While this has all the necessary 'tools' to be great, it just isn't (in my opinion). We have a cast with great actors such as Christina Ricci, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Luis Guzman, Gwendoline Christie and the new star Jenna Ortega who is really really good. We have Tim Burton who directed four episodes. We have music of Danny Elfman on four episodes. We have Romania, who could've been used as it is, instead of turning it into an American land. Even with all of this, it just couldn't deliver (to me).It has nothing to do with the madness of the Addams Family tradition, it's more like a fantastic world of J. K. Rowling after listening to Bauhaus, while at the same time talking in teenage internet language. Painfully cringe, many times predictable. All the goth stuff you can think of, it's here, but presented in a way that is, like I said, cringe. I'm expecting that in a future episode we'll see Wednesday drinking absinthe in a cemetery and reading Poe's poems, or maybe using some Book of Shadows, Ouja Board and some occult-themed stuff (which wouldn't be new, but lets see how predictable this show will be). The grandiose moment when Wednesday pronounces \"mansplaining\", you know you got a Netflix production.While the Addams family of the 90s (both the movies and the animated series which I loved as a kid) had a darker humor that made you laugh, here I didn't even smirk. Maybe I'm just one of the old generation that is lost in the past and can't connect with today's generation, and I'm stuck with the rather more offensive, darker humor of those movies. The humor in here is just too mainstream, too gentle, too cliché. Looking at the high praises given here in the reviews, and then going to the profiles of the people who wrote them, I understand that this is a tv series that is great for the teenagers of today. The generations differ, that is clear in many aspects, and this is one example. That doesn't mean I'm right and they are wrong, of course. The same is for me, who as a 90s Addams Family fan can't really enjoy the first shows from the 60s to the fullest, or even the 1998 adaptations which were truly horrible (even though Nicole Fugere was great and I was in love with her when I was a kid). I didn't even bother to watch the 2019 and 2021 animated movies. So Wednesday 2022 is not the worst.Even so. You can't even tell it's a Tim Burton movie. I don't know what happened to Burton, but after Sweeney Todd he seems to have lost his brilliance. Yes, Dark Shadows and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children might have a bit of his touch, but not in the way we think of him. When you say Tim Burton you say Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow, Big Fish, Corpse Bride and even though not directed by him, the classic Nightmare Before Christmas. Adding an Addams Family would've been a must-have in his profile, but this one just didn't work out.The school for weirdos is actually more normal than the school I was at. The principle of the school (Gwendoline Christie) is out of character and more of a 'normie' than a 'weirdo'. The other actors are so plain that I can't even remember their names. There were those two teenagers in the bookshop trying to flirt as in a 80s teen movie. I don't remember their names, but that moment was so cringe I felt like screaming and slamming my face in the monitor. I guess I can be Wednesday too. I think that Thing has the best acting. Oh, and Christina Ricci is doing a good job at... whatever she's supposed to do/be in the film (later edit: found out her role in film and it's good, but her character's final discovery was made in a mediocre style). With all the respect I have for Catherine Zeta-Jones, she just doesn't make you feel like she makes a good Morticia, as for Luiz Guzman, again, not a good fit for a fantasy style movie (he will always be El Cid for me: from Oz). However, the worst character and actor here is Fred Armisen/Uncle Fester. When the guy came out I thought that he's like a villain from a Fox Kids/Nickeldeon/Nick Jr. Production who happened to steal Cruella de Vil's motorcycle while having Raiden's electric superpowers. What-is-this?! Compare Fred's Uncle Fester with Christopher Lloyd's Uncle Fester and you'll see the HUGE difference.There are some good things here and there, and the dance scene is indeed great, Jena's moves and stare are perfect! The scene when she speaks in German to the tourists is also great, and it's something that really brings the real character of Wednesday as known in the Addams Family tradition. The piranha scene is also characteristic to Wednesday we all know and love. The scene when she plays the cello is also amazing, it actually gave me chills (good ones). The sword fight is great as well, her fighting skills in general are great. \"Thing\" being portrayed very human-like in character/personality (like he's one who likes to take care of his skin) is really cool as well.Yes, goth girl goes to Hogwarts. This is so much like Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, Harry Potter, Scooby Doo and X-men that is so far from the original idea and charm of the Addams Family. Drop some teenage hormones, since it's a Netflix production, and there you have it. Enjoy the stew!Season 2 started well but went painfully cringe, again with all the Harry Potter stuff and some cultural references that would make any educated person cry for mercy.The beginning was ok, and I am under the impression that the dialogue has improved. It has more of the old school Addams Family vibe, with the dark humor and less cringe verbal expressions.... until Principal Dort comes into play and makes everything so cringe it makes you ashamed for watching this.Some scenes were creepier as well, with a bit of gory elements, that fit the Addams perfectly. However, other scenes just tormented me.A great surprise was a scene that is straight out of Tim Burton's old stuff, but I won't get into detail so I don't give any spoilers.It is sensational that great actors such as Christina Ricci, Luis Guzman, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Gwendoline Christie, Steve Buscemi and Christopher Lloyd didn't fit well in their characters. These might be their worst roles in their careers. Also, important characters such as Pugsley, Gomez, Morticia and Lurch were so terrible compared to The Addams Family movies. Jenna Ortega does a good job, but can't be compared to Christina Ricci's Wednesday (but still, Jenna does a good job).We must remember and accept that this is for the new generation, for the teenagers aged 12-15, not for the old generation. So for them, it's probably great. One good thing is that it's getting them used to the macabre and dark humor, not letting them be soft snowflakes.",

They literally called this a CW show with Wednesday Addams. I was shocked because I'll be honest this is probably the best experience I've had watching a show on Netflix since the first season of stranger things. Not only is it one of the best shows I've seen this year but it's probably one of the best things that Tim Burton has done in a very long time. Jenna Ortega is the best part of the show but all the other characters are extremely likable as well and nobody is perfect. Which is also the thing that I like the most is that everybody in the show is flawed. It's not super over the top cartoony dark like some of the movies are but it takes a little bit more of a realistic approach with the Addams family personalities and relationships. The Burton monster elements are still there though and they are awesome to watch. If you look at it more through the angle of Wednesday trying to find empathy and a reason to care about the people around her you get a lot more out of it. So for me personally I really don't understand why snobby critics just accuse us of being a cheesy teen drama with a consensus that you would see on CW... because it has a lot more to say than those types of shows and it's also very smart in the approach that they have with the Addams family and their relationship with each other and the people in the town that this takes place in.

I don't think this is \"updating\" the story but completely undermining what we loved about it to begin with. She doesn't seem sassy or funny just rude. The Addams's were always scrupulously polite - even to their enemies - it added to the humour and showed how classy they were, yet Wednesday is yet to offer a civil word to anyone. The success of any show depends to some extent on our identification and sympathy with it's central character but there is nothing at all so far to make you care in the slightest what Wednesday does next.

In what is supposed to be a constant tongue-in-cheek flirtatious relationship is completely annihilated by the fact that Catherine Zeta-Jones wouldn't be in a romantic relationship with Luis Guzman, ever.

There are bits to this that could have been fun or interesting Gwendolyn Christie is wildly under used. Catherine zeta-jones will never be mistaken for angelica Houston. I thought the Gomez casting was interesting as it did seem to be a closer match to the original comics. But again no one can touch Raoul Julia. I can see already where this series is going and I think it will be another that will flame out quickly for netflix.",

The plot is a little hard to follow and people expecting this to be an Addams Family reboot will not be happy, but the show stands on its own. It's enjoyable and unique and definitely worth the watch if only for Ortega's performance. The cinematography is beautiful as well, everything is catered around Wednesday, so she stands out in every scene, even in a school full of \"outcasts\". I especially enjoyed the juxtaposition between Wednesday and her bubbly roommate. People who enjoyed Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and Series of Unfortunate Events will love this show.",

I absolutely loved The Terminal List starring Chris Pratt so I've been looking forward to this ever since they announced this spinoff a few years ago. This spinoff is a prequel story about Ben Edwards (Taylor Kitsch), who was in the first one but takes center stage here. I've been a fan of Kitsch ever since he starred in the amazing Friday Night Lights. He's awesome here too. Chris Pratt is also back as James Reece and even though he's just a supporting character in this series he's as good as always. It also stars a bunch of other great actors like Tom Hopper, Luke Hemsworth, Jai Courtney, Constance Wu, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Michael Ealy and plenty of others you will recognize. There is plenty of action and drama to keep you entertained throughout each episode. The only bad thing I can say is they didn't release all the episodes at once and we have to wait a week between episodes. It's much better as a binge watch.",

Glad they dropped three episodes and two and three get into black ops and pursuing old foes.Watching Ben Edwards' journey is going to be fascinating-not only for the action, but because this series leans hard into the deeper questions. Characters are not just black and white; they live in the greys, wrestling with loyalty, betrayal, and the limits of violence. It asks, what is the cost of courage? May our courage exceed our level of violence.The show balances its intensity with a moral compass, unflinching in showing how blurred the lines can become when the mission and personal conviction collide. It brings to mind Owen's haunting words from The Pity of War: \"My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.\" That spirit permeates Dark Wolf-it's as much about the toll of choices as it is about bullets and missions.And the craftsmanship? On another level. The cinematography and music feel movie-quality, with a pulse that amplifies every scene. The acting and dialogue feel authentic, carrying verisimilitude rarely seen in modern TV.This isn't just a prequel but a spinoff-it's a continuation with its own grit, conscience, and style. If these three episodes are any indication, Dark Wolf is about to become appointment viewing. And watch some of the behind-the-scenes and promotions for this series, along with teasing more in the Jack Carr universe that is being developed. I've read each of Jack Carr's books, and I'm glad he is involved in fleshing out his characters more in this medium. This is an excellent addition to the Terminal List series.",

I WANT MORE!!!I has been like a reunion of sorts to be reunited with the characters that we know and love from the books, and to see such an incredible story written just for the show that treats the first season and the book with respect, while still standing on its own!The acting in this is terrific. Tom embodies the fan-favorite, Raife, in a way I didn't think was going to be possible (great job, dude) Loved him in Black Sails, and this blows that performance away. Dar brings Mo to life & Luke does Landry in such a way that I cannot picture Landry as anyone else now!! I was already looking forward to True Believer & even more so now! Boozer!!!! Jared Shaw returning as Boozer just makes me smile, because I wanted more Boozer in Terminal List. LaMonica Garrett was underutilized in Terminal List season 1. He's a significant talent, as proven in 1882. Seeing him reprise his role in such a strong way is also flat-out fantastic!!Let's not forget about the ladies of the show, either. Shiraz and Rona-Lee are both so believable and strong in their performances.Jack Carr must be one of the nicest, most loyal people alive. Or, Chris Pratt is. Or both. I love how they brought back the cast from Season 1, and how they continue to support those who supported them; as well as continue to develop these characters that us fans have invested in & grown obsessed with.If you like Historical fiction mixed with military and spy-movie qualities - THIS SHOW IS FOR YOU!

Instead of exploring complex characters or presenting nuanced themes, the show leans into the most egregious kind of one-dimensional, unironic propaganda - the sort of thing you'd expect from a parody like Team America, only played completely straight. This makes it difficult to take the drama seriously, and the experience becomes frustrating rather than entertaining.It's a real tragedy, because the premise had so much potential.

This guy legit is a skilled actor, whether it's his action performances, emotional displays, or his perfect comedic timing and deadpan delivery. I mean wow, I'm hooked!At first I was wtf is this, especially the opening credit's dancing, then as I grew to know the characters better, and seeing Cena do things that I'd never thought I'd see filmed, I realized how genius and different this series was, and the more I watched, the more I wanted.I waited until all 8 episodes were released, and binged, and am glad I did. I may have lost interest or got too anxious in between releases, but in binging, I was glued to the TV and wanted more antics and craziness and I couldn't stop. I was addicted! Had I had to wait for the next episode a week later, I'd have withdrawals - it hooks you in that good!This is Gunn's greatest creation, and Cena's greatest performance, and it was pulled off with a low budget, so I can't wait till HBO throws money at Gunn for the next season due to its critical success. Everything on this show was near perfection; Gunn's directing and writing, all casting and performances - what a bunch of characters! The cinematography, visuals and S/VFX spot on. Eagly is my new favorite sidekick! And Gunn's choice of the soundtrack and score - amazing! I will be buying that soundtrack when available for sure!I applaud everyone involved in this little gem we all didn't know we wanted, but needed - a refreshing change in the typical superhero genre. It's a well deserved 9/10 from me, and I'm already having withdrawals, so get onto the next season ASAP ladies and gentlemen, I'll be re-watching the current episodes until then.",

Everyone had a thing to latch onto or relate to. (Excluding the first team of course) everyone had something I could get behind even thought they were villains. Harley had relationship issues and the team helped develop her, bloodsport had daughter and father issues, polka dot man had mommy issues, ratcatcher 2 had issues as well and they had clear motives that drove their story that I could relate to.... Then you had... peacemaker, a man who's background was vague... especially when it was only a repeated line by Amanda Waller comparing his background to Bloodsport.... A man who is wanting world peace at all costs with no matter how many men women and children he has to kill to get it... what a scum bag.... Being one of the reasons why some important character met their demise I was not too fond of peacemaker.... But hey that's the point, he's a villain... so when the end credit scene played I'm sure I wasn't the only one trying to root for a specific someone to be okay... but nonetheless peacemaker was that someone.... Regardless, we made it up until this point.... All that buildup and universe Gunn has made all leads up to a spin off tv show that nobody asked for... and I gotta say.... It's absolutely delightful. John Cena Definitely shines in this role. He has a lot of charisma and development in the first episode alone that it helps actually understand why somebody can become as messed up as he is.

While they both are far from being stellar examples of a prudent politician, we are being shown how good and noble they are by resisting sinister white men on the other side. Thank heavens, at least the creators spared us from injecting a dose of \"evil Russians\" this time... Apart from corny political agitation, from the theatrics viewpoint, the series carries near zero suspense value, as all the baddies are identified pretty early, and not by investigative work of law enforcement, but are just shown to us in plain view, plotting their dark deeds.

Siblings that look wildly different, some look the same age as their mother, totally unexplained how a woman can have 9 kids and also 2 university degrees whilst looking 40, we were laughing about it throughout the whole show because it was so ridiculous! Like fully thought they would all turn out to be adopted as the big twist, it was so bad!Story - could not care less about most of the secondary characters but quite liked a few of them. Most of the side plots felt like wasted time, and there were too many (and some of the acting was pretty flat). The main romantic story was full of toxic tropes but actually redeemed itself a bit - my initial \"nice guy\" I genuinely hated by the end, and the \"bad guy\" who I hated at the start I really came to feel for by the end. Like obviously a classic trope but it got me! Main character was fairly bland but likeable enough.Elephant in the room - The main thing that bothered me throughout is that a teenage girl who's been though a really traumatic event is put into this chaotic environment and pursued by what are essentially like her brothers in this situation - I wish the family had actually looked after her (instead of just saying they did) because in real life this would be a worrying situation for a young vulnerable girl. But, it's just a story and in the end she does sort of save herself.So, I would recommend this show only if you have a buddy to watch with, because there will be parts where you will be ripping your hair out and need someone to laugh about it with.

She moved on from the lost of her family really fast.Between the mean girl Erin and the playboy Cole. This show is mostly just a bunch of stereotypes about American high school.

The characters, their relationships and chemistry all felt organic. I could see this being a real family (95% of shows streaming currently make me roll my eyes 5 mins in or half way through, and I decide to not waste anymore time on them, looking at you Obliterated!!), the circumstance felt plausible, the character's motivations and decisions felt realistic (a very head on straight kinda way). This is how I picture a family (country folk so to speak) which lives in a small close knit community with strong values and bonds would be. So even though some would argue that a family that size with those problems wouldnt be that homogeneous, it just didnt matter.I really hope this series gets a second season not for the romance but just the good feels.Highly recommend giving this show a chance.

She just empty stares at other actors' faces without a blink and shows literally no reaction on her face to ANYTHING, and I repeat, to ANYTHING said or happened to her. The most you can see is her lips painfully trying to move a little, it is literally PAINFUL to watch. Why is she even staring at people like a damn psychopath all the time instead of giving normal reactions??? How does the director feel okay with this?

Greenberg, and the cast includes Buffy / Angel mainstay Julie Benz).Dexter is a sociopath, someone with no human feelings and hence no natural, inner moral compass, and he has an unquenchable blood lust that drives him to kill. But he had the great grace to have been the adopted child of a police officer, who (as we see in terrific flashbacks) successfully instilled in him a complete moral code, which he adheres to on a strictly intellectual level. This is an utterly brilliant concept (which I assume derives from the novels it's based on), one that allows the writers to explore the nature of moral behavior and of what it means to be human (Dexter is, in a sense, an alien).Another thing the show is doing brilliantly is moving at different speeds in parallel. There is a primary apparent season-long story arc (concerning a cat-and-mouse game between Dexter and a serial killer), and a a secondary arc involving Dexter's sister's police career. The first handful of episodes include a very powerful completed arc concerning one of Dexter's police colleagues and a local crime lord, while two of the four episodes so far have also included a self-contained story spliced among (and playing off) the ongoing ones. I've seen the future of TV season structuring, and this is it.While the writing isn't quite up to the brilliance of the best of _House_, it's been excellent. The cast and production are terrific. The only reason you wouldn't want to watch this utterly brilliant show is the frequent use of extremely graphic images: there have probably been more severed body parts shown in these first four episodes than in the first four episodes of every other TV show on the air combined. If you can stomach that, tune it for a mesmerizing look at what makes us human -- or inhuman.",

Dexter is devoid of normal, human emotion, and has to learn behaviors by rote. Seeing the world through his eyes enables us to closely examine what is \"right\" and what is \"wrong.\" We have to pause and wonder about our own perception of reality.Overall, the show is a side-splitting outlet for the vigilante/serial killer/dysfunctional being in all of us.

Not only are both of these shows completely original and innovative, but they are REALLY good.Dexter, in particular, should not be reviewed by anyone who hasn't seen more than three episodes. I almost feel as if the first episode in the series is a tad-bit melodramatic (note Dexter screaming in the face of his first victim) just to pull in viewers that otherwise need something more visceral than a great screenplay.By two more episodes the viewer should be absolutely intoxicated by the complexity of the character Dexter and the acting of Michael C. Hall. His own co-stars admit to being almost \"scared\" by how well Hall absorbs his character. Personally, I think that without Hall's mastery of Dexter there would be nothing to watch. Don't get me wrong, the plot of this show is extremely intriguing (and original, to be redundant), but the excitement lies purely in the way Dexter/Hall responds to A) his girlfriend, B) blood, and C) other serial killers.I think that it is very reasonable to chuckle at Dexter's attempts to \"fit in\" social situations and I believe the writers of this show planned on it. What I am still stuck on, however, is whether or not to cheer Dexter on in his methodology (serial killing serial killers). This had better be the first of many seasons, so spread the word......Edit: I watched this series finale last night and come back to this review (which I wrote after the conclusion of Season 1) with my hat in hand to say: \"I'm kind of sorry for the hype.\"If my review was the impetus for your 'Dexter' obsession (I, too, was obsessed) then I owe you an apology for the way it all ended.

By having a resounding premise of catching a notorious serial killer while trying to conceal his own identity, Dexter enters each week with a new sociological dilemma as well as a new criminal to dispatch. What is best about Dexter is his own personal facade of trying to be normal.

In one episode he proved he can take a character from boringly evil to someone I'd invite over to watch the Sunday game.Julie Benz provided a chillingly accurate portrayal of Dexter's scarred and fragile girlfriend as well. One would almost expect to see her on Oprah in fact.Along with the actors, proper credit must be given to the writers as well. These two characters, along with Dexter's adoptive father, are incredibly well created and nurtured to the point that I was willing to cheer them through their respective faults. On the other hand, the writers should be flogged for the remaining characters. In order to build sympathy with Dexter, he has been surrounded by THE most annoying people possible. For example, while I have absolutely no desire to commit any crimes outside of tax evasion, if Dexter doesn't kill his whiny, gutless, how-the-f***-did-she-become-a-cop sister, I will.With that in mind, the promise of the recurring bad-guy killer (Dexter is the good-guy killer) will keep me tuned in as this show desperately needs a third point of interest.",

I have seen prison break, heroes and a lot other. Prison break and heroes first season was awesome. They inspired me so much that I got some tattoo's done on my body. However both these series cut loose as soon they go to the next season. Heroes was big disappointment but DEXTER.. OMG series after series it starts to make me so curious about the next episode.. damn the season 4. I just could not sleep the whole night after watching it. I spent my weekend watching the episodes back to back.To start with Dexter (Michael C.

Damn Debra is one character who is so confused and mostly been controlled by the people around her, she always end up doing something wrong but always gets credit for the good things too.I love the part when you get to know what is going on in Dexters mind when he thinks about something or when someone is talking to him also the part when he talks to his dead father Harry. (he just thinks what his dad would say in that situation). All the episodes/characters and all the seasons are written and played so well that you can hardly find any flaw in it.My favorite characters are Dexter (Quite obvious), Rita and Vince Masuka damn Vince is so funny, he just utter one word in his entire episode and comes out to be damn funny.I just cant wait for the Season 5 and I am sure whosoever watched dexter feels the same way just like I did.(Apologizes in case my first review has some mistakes and offends somebody's feelings)",

In this case, the consensus is accurate, and that is:Seasons 1-6: outstanding. Deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy of Hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. GoT is worth watching for these seasons, definitely.Season 7: you suddenly notice the writing and plotting has taken a sharp dive downwards in quality. There are inexplicable ideas, inconsistent characterisation and soap-opera dramas. But at least the entertainment value is still very high, so it gets a pass.Season 8: this drop chasms down to depths you didn't think possible. The writing has got so amateurish that the still-fantastic production values are no longer enough to save it. If you ever enjoyed Lost but were amazed at how bad the final season was, you're in familiar territory here.The biggest problem with the final season was it took us out of the story and got us thinking about its many weaknesses. We lost our suspension of disbelief. Fatal for fiction. It also ruined the series-arcs to the point where a rewatch of the entire series is pointless.So can I recommend a GoT marathon for newcomers? Yes, the first 6 seasons are worth the disappointments later on. But best series of all time it is not. It could've been, but dropping the ball in the final stretch puts it behind the following superior series more worthy of your marathon:Battlestar Galactica (2003-2008)Twin Peaks (all 3 seasons, plus the movie)Breaking Bad",

I think some people love the sound of their own voice and think their opinion is worth something and will be disagreeable simply for the sake of it.Having said that, this show is stunning. I have never read the books and now I want to. There is so much crap on TV that is renewed year after year (CSI, House etc.) which uses cheap gags, pointless and sometimes ridiculous plots, unbelievable and many times one dimensional characters and yet all the truly great shows get cancelled.There is enough brain-dead television. But once in a while a show comes along that transports you to another world and makes you believe in the magic of television again. Game of Thrones is one such show.It is complex, multi-layered, surreal, vibrant, imaginative and it draws your eye in to the surprising level of detail, from the sweeping vistas, to the narrow dungeons, from the beautiful castles and magnificent trees, to the contrasting landscapes. It is worth watching just for the scenery alone.Yes the acting seems a little cold and even wooden at times, but this is perfectly in keeping with the medieval look and feel of the show. Yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.The scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting, led by Sean Bean perfectly cast as Lord Edard. Although Sean Bean is better known for brooding bad guys, he strikes the perfect balance between father, husband and Lord and soldier. He is well supported by other well known actors and many new to the scene.After watching and sometimes enjoying Camelot, this show makes that one look more like \"Merlin\" by comparison. And where Camelot lacks in depth and scripting, Game of Thrones strikes the perfect balance between brooding medieval angst and wonderful fantasy story telling.Even if you have never watched a fantasy show before, you should not miss this.",

I initially get excited to see one of my favorite series on the big screen, and eventually walk away disgusted. For whatever reason, most shows and movies that are based on epic book series absolutely butcher the original content.So when I saw the preview for \"Game of Thrones\" on HBO, I was immediately skeptical. Oh, I was going to watch it, but I didn't have high expectations. I did hold a little hope because HBO is known for their high quality shows.I was absolutely shocked to watch the Pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. The language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. It stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it.The acting is superb and I actually felt like I was looking into Winterfell for the first time. I feel like I've actually got faces to add to the characters that I've been reading about for a long time.If you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from HBO to add some spice to the series. This is not the case at all. The books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the Pilot. I am very proud of HBO for producing an amazingly accurate product. I will be watching every week for sure.If you enjoyed what you saw in the Pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. \"Game of Thrones\" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. I would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.UPDATE:I have now watched 3 Episodes and I wanted to come back and report some more. Even after 3 Episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. Overall the acting is still very good. I hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script. I don't get this impression with this HBO adaptation.Each episode of this series leaves me itching for the next weekend. I really hate watching shows in real time because I enjoy absorbing several hours of a show at one time. But, a good show will keep you looking forward to it the whole week.A special note to viewers that have not read the books... Keep watching! This series has numerous twists and turns and full of epic battles and action. It may seem like it's taking a little while to develop, but the reward is well worth the wait.Even after 3 episodes, I would still highly recommend this to anyone.",

And I couldn't have been more wrong! Where do I start...The cast is great, though not amazing with one exception - Sean Bean is perfect for the role of cold master of the North, Eddard Stark. The setting, the atmosphere is perfect and not boring at all! Some scenes are just amazing and are exactly as written in the book - for example the scene where they find the wolves, the nature and the dialogs are just as they should be. Now to get to the part most people are interested in: What is this? What can I expect of the series?THIS IS NOT LORD OF THE RINGS. Now that I got that out, I can continue. The very idea behind the series is a lot different. It's based around great families on different sides of the world, the stories their members have to tell and the secrets they hide. And there are many secrets, You will have a chance to witness small portion of them in the first episode. If you cannot follow the story just yet, don't worry! It's meant to be like that, you will eventually get to know all the characters and get involved in the story so much you will BEG for next episode just to see what happens.What to expect? Plots, love, action, war, hatred, quite a few surprises and much much more... All that after the first episode. I really hope they will not ruin it as the series progress.Conclusion: Do not miss this! Yes YOU complaining that the book is better. And everyone else.",

So when I first heard that HBO will do a series on the this book I was thrilled but I was afraid that they will not be done exactly by the book. But I must say that I was wrong and that the series is better than I thought it would be. Much better!While I watched the first episode I had the same excitement as the time when I first read the book. HBO has done a great job and they fulfill all my expectations. Sean Bean was born for the role of Eddard Stark. Costumes, scenes, actors, everything is done as it should be. Actors are perfect for the role they play in the series.For me the biggest surprise of the series I figure Daenerys Targaryen. Emilia Clarke actress who plays Daenerys Targaryen is more beautiful than I imagined it would be and more beautiful than is described in the book.The Wall is a lot different than I had imagined, but in a good way.The series revolves around Eddard Stark and his family. He has a wife and five children, three sons and two daughters. Eddard Stark is ruler of the North and close friend of King Robert who needs his help in ruling the Seven Kingdoms.The seven kingdoms, united under one ruler, have lived a life of peace and comfort since King Robert took the throne. But nothing is ever as it seems. Within the king's court there is murder and treason, with no one aware of what is really going on. Across the seas, the last remnants of the previous royal family gather forces to reclaim their throne. To the north, the unthinkable gathers, the creatures of myth and legend that have been forgotten.",

            "review": "The first 5 Seasons of Game Of Thrones are exceptional, a beautifully structured series. The sets, characters, pacing, twists - exceptional. I could not fault it, however, after that things went downhill.When it came to Season 5, the author of the books (George R. R. Martin) and HBO had a disagreement. Martin wanted the show to run across more series, to give all his complex story lines the chance to grow & move at a natural pace. HBO declined and so he dropped off the project, which is extremely evident.Season 6 & 7, although flawed, were still watchable. The books & George's earlier comments paved the way for both seasons, but you could feel that the episodes lacked substance.This brings us to the latest season, and after 2 years of waiting expectations were very high. The first two episodes were very plain, the reunions were wonderful, however you could tell they were setting up for one of the biggest fights of the series, which had been greatly anticipated since Season 1. I tried to not to have too high of expectations, however the director referred to episode 3 as \"bigger than Helms Deep\" which is a comment that will always spark excitement.Episode 3 was so utterly disappointing, in every way. If you were somehow able to see through the intense darkness (what was the director thinking?) you will crumble to the poor decisions made by writers. I will not stem into this too much, but basically Dan & Dave chose to go down the Hollywood path, completely disregarding any real story or strategy. Episode 4 was equally as disappointing, which I was hoping would redeem the final season.The writers have ruined this final season by fast tracking characters (basically teleporting), making the smartest of characters docile, and letting plot armor protect 'favorites'. I am still going to watch until the end, but I thought I would warn any future viewer to prepare yourself, as there is nothing more heartbreaking than watching terrible writing ruin a otherwise tremendous series.",

There have been a good few straight to DVD movies over the last 15-20 years which on the whole have all been garbage. The BBC's King and Conqueror series offered a real chance to do it right. Sadly it has not.There will be people who aren't so historically minded that will enjoy this series as a period, sword and shield, kings and queens type show but the reality is it's just not been done well. Even taking out the constant liberties it takes with the real history the script, costume and acting are on the whole just bad. At times the acting feels wooden, forced and not believable. The writing again at times, not always, lacks imagination and is plain boring. There are no moments that cause you to take any real notice of the show.The racially diverse cast does also take away from the ability of a show like this to immerse you in the period. When you watch a period piece you want to feel like you are watching that time period. There are some shows from the last 20 years that do this, HBO Rome, the earlier seasons of the Last Kingdom, even The Tudors all all its historical liberties. These shows actually make you feel like you could be watching the period it's trying to recreate. But King and Conqueror, with a black Earl of Mercia and a black Thane Thomas, it detracts from the ability of the show to pull you into the time period. Whilst I do not doubt there were black people present in Anglo Saxon England they would have been extremely rare and in some parts of the country almost a myth. I do not take away from the skill of Jason Forbes and Elander Moore who on the whole act well along with Nikolaj Custer-Waldau but again just make it at least a true reflection of society at the time.It is a shame that this show was not done better. I've anticipated it for the last year and it's fallen flat in my opinion. Edward the Confessor was also portrayed as a weak puppet.

Also the DEI quota seems to be quite high, I never knew one of the Earls was not European!?!The dialogue is so modern it's like listening to a modern police drama, not a story set in the 11th century.

I heard about it previously and it had a great rating as well as on IMDb, so I gave a shot.Wow, are you kidding me! This series is like an American version of those Korean or Taiwanese screaming, tearing, slow-paced TV drama shows. Don't get me wrong. Those kind of shows are extremely popular in Asia and my mother loves them except me. I agree that everyone has standards when it comes to show and film; however, this as the best in America where Hollywood resides... NO. Well, comparing to others, it could be the best and that's why I gave it one star rather than none.\"Slow-pacing\" is perceived differently. I don't consider \"Tree of Life\" as slow-paced and I think it is one of the most inspirational movies ever made. \"Tree of Life\" conveys ideas with a flow of images more often than words. Through images and occasional dialogue and narratives, it leaves bread crumbs for audience to find the clues. I thought it was brilliant and the way, it showed me, intrigued me and carried me emotionally to the end.Now, about \"Breaking Bad,\" it is very slow-paced because it showed me everything and that wasn't enough, it also told me everything. I got bored in the middle of first season but I really tried to like the series so I continued. I even started to draw (my past time hobby) while \"watching\" the episodes because I didn't really have to watch it anymore. Just by hearing it, I could learn everything about the story.The WORST was all the screaming, yelling, arguing and tearing. Well, that wasn't as severe as Korean/Taiwanese drama shows, but it was just too much for me. I guess that is why it is so popular ... I mean look at all the reality shows. Doesn't the audience love reality TV people yelling at each other in TV? 9.5/10 on IMDb ... well, Iron Man 3 has 7.4/10 and tree of life as 6.7/10. This tells me everything and so sad ... so sad.",

It touches on the very same themes, \"living realistically as a middle class in the United States\" which often makes us resort to extremes to survive. Like the mother and daughter team that robbed that bank. But the weed selling antics of Showtime's hit show is really nothing like \"Bad.\" The Pilot was about as perfect a Pilot as I've ever seen, and much of it rests on Bryan Cranston's shoulders.Cranston plays Cheimstry teacher Walter White. He has a loving wife, a child with Cerebal Palsy and another is on the way. He also happens to be dying from an inoperable lung cancer situation, which happened although he \"never smoked.\" His finances in disarray, the once great student of science turns to crime to solve his problems.He cooks Crystal Meth with a good for nothing ex-student.

He embodies a man who is against a rock, and an even harder place, who has no other option but to throttle his higher aspirations and grimly carry on.

            "review": "As the clueless, hapless and hopeless father of four on the celebrated series MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE, Bryan Cranston came into his own, as he did an amazing balancing act that juggled slapstick, pathos and insanity all at once, proving that not only did \"father NOT know best\", but more than likely never would.Now he essays the role of another father in the new series BREAKING BAD, but it's a shocking, bracingly refreshing turn that takes his 'Three Stooges' repertoire of grunts, shrieks, barks and neurotic ticks and virtually throws them out the window. Some of those qualities are still there, but unlike MALCOLM, BREAKING is the blackest of black comedies. When I first heard about it, the reviews I read compared it heavily (and favorably) to the Coen Brothers' dark crime comedy FARGO. And the comparisons are aptly warranted.This is one of those series where the less you know about it going in, the better, but just to set your mind reeling with the possibilities, here it is in a nutshell: Cranston plays high school chemistry teacher Walter White, who is constantly battling the lackadaisical attitudes of his disinterested students, the looming specter of financial disaster - by supplementing his paltry teacher's salary with a second job at a local car wash, and trying to cope with the impending arrival of a new baby, even as he and his wife raise their disabled teenage son, whom unlike many stereotypical portrayals of handicapped kids is no Pollyanna-like angel.Then in the midst of all this, Walter makes a shocking discovery: he has inoperable lung cancer, and therefore only a few years left to live at best. Facing the very real possibility of leaving his family struggling not only with his death, but a financial situation that could only end in catastrophe, Walter suddenly has a revelation, thanks to an idea handed to him by his boorish brother-in-law, who works with the DEA - he decides to become a crystal meth dealer.Okay, so while you're letting your brain take that all in, you also need to know that this is one of those defining roles where you just know that the lead actor will get Emmy recognition, whether he intended to or not. That is just how good Cranston is as Walter. In fact, he's every bit as good as Michael C. Hall's Dexter Morgan, James Gandolfini's Tony Soprano or Harold Perrineau's criminally under-appreciated Augustus Hill. And he's backed by an amazing supporting cast of mostly new or unfamiliar faces (with the exception of Dean Norris as the brother-in-law).You can tell from the word 'go' that writer/producer/director Vince Gilligan (former head writer/exec producer on THE X FILES) has been champing at the bit for a while to let fly with a project like this. And if the first episode is any indication, AMC has another real winner on its hands. So MAD MEN will need to move over and make some room...since BREAKING BAD isn't the kind of series to \"ask nicely.\"Which brings up another important point: this is not a series for everyone, the way that FARGO and Showtime's kindred-spirit drug dramedy WEEDS are not mainstream, either. This is sharp, biting, satirical social commentary that draws blood when it sinks its teeth in, and you are guaranteed to wince even as you laugh out loud at Cranston's dead-on portrayal of a MAN on the edge of a nervous breakdown (well, more like over the edge.)A caveat for would-be viewers, though, and a very ironic one at that: AMC has applied its ham-fisted method of editing its movies to this series as well, unfortunately, making the channel the LAST place you want to see it. The best thing to do is to check out the premiere episode whenever you can catch a rerun on AMC, then hustle on over to iTunes and download it so you can watch it again. Some very important scenes and some impressive establishing shots have been \"edited for time and content\" from the broadcast version, and this is material that IS essential to your experience viewing this show. There is a lot more to the characters and situations than you will be allowed to see on basic cable. So as you watch, keep that in mind.And after you are done marveling at this magnificent character study sketched in desperation, you can wonder as I did, whether Bryan Cranston will bother preparing a speech for next year's Emmys. I sure hope he does...thanks to his work on BREAKING BAD, he'll need it.",

This one really hits home and gives a true behind the scenes look at what most would consider the bad guys. I'm not condoning the contents of the story, and I don't think the show is either, there is no glamor in what these boys are doing, but it's giving an insight to the darker side of many streets.How the denial and desperation that can occur to the common working stand up citizen, the pillar of society that suddenly changes his moral standing in a society driven by the almighty dollar. This is pretty dam close to Fallen (Michel Douglas) but with up to date street smarts nd a lot more punch.The characters don't over exaggerate their roles and the story line isn't filled with cleaver dialog or near to impossible feats of bravery or beating impossible odds.

'Breaking Bad' had that effect on me, and its reputation as one of the best, consistently brilliant and most addictive shows in many years (maybe even ever) is more than deserved in my eyes. Its weakest season is perhaps the first season, understandable as any show's first season is the one where things are still settling.Actually everything is established remarkably from the very start, but once the writing and characterisation becomes even meatier the show reaches even higher levels.Visually, 'Breaking Bad' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.The writing for 'Breaking Bad' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The direction couldn't be better.Can't say anything bad about the acting. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal as one of the most fascinating anti-heroes, or even of any kind of character, in either film or television. Aaron Paul has never been better and Anna Gunn is affecting. The characters are compelling in their realism.Overall, describing it as brilliant doesn't do 'Breaking Bad' justice. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review": "While I love the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov(and the Empire and Robots series), I admit it may be a bit dated. The novels were written during the '50s and Asimov never described the visuals in detail.It was therefore expected that any adaptation would diverge from the source material. And I don't mind it. A faithful adaptation would not be possible because we wouldn't know how the ships are supposed to look like, for example. I don't mind the gender swap in itself.But the creators take too many liberties with the source materials to the point the story doesn't make sense for any science fiction fan. If Terminus is 55,000 light years away from Trantor and the colonists don't have jump ships, how do they travel? Why does it take 900 days to get there? That would mean they are travelling at 22,300 times the speed of light. This kind of oversight may be OK for a Marvel show, not for a show where math plays a central role.I was also disheartened by changing Demerzel's gender. Not because of itself, but because in the books Eto Dermerzel is a very special character with a deep backstory. Changing his gender sends ripples everywhere. It's like making Han Solo or Ron Weasley a woman.Hari's relationship with Raych is also changed for the worse, presumably to make room for Gaal. Sigh.All these changes leave us with really impressive visuals and a weakened story. Not the Foundation I expected.",

            "review": "Isaac Asimov was not a great stylist, but like a lot of the original pulp-fiction sci-fi writers, he knew how to combine smart futurism with page-turning suspense.A lot of people are mad about switches in race/gender or in the story, but I read the original trilogy 40 years ago and other books in the series almost as long ago so I don't remember the characters. I don't recall Asimov writing especially compelling characters, so I'm surprised people are so attached.Where I feel Foundation fails Asimov is that it's not the TV equivalent of a page turner. It's slow and not especially intriguing. I don't care what's going to happen next. I'm not interested in the fates of the characters. I'm not compelled by the underlying futurism Asimov built the books on.I was going to stop after one dull episode but a legitimate page-turner ending got me to watch another, which like the first was 90% boring and 10% kinda-interesting-I-guess.The special effects are good. Some of the cast is good, particularly Lee Pace as a cut-throat emperor (and I do like lead Gaal Dornick, who has been criticized a lot in the user reviews but has a solid intensity). The pacing is terrible, the writing is poor. Don't bother.",

In some ways, the translation from the written work to the big screen suffers from the politically correct interpretation and deviation from the original story outline. At the same time, standing on its own and using the most broad plot outlines from Asimov, the television script offers a quite different vision of a parallel Foundation universe that offers both typical, conventional scenes of relationships, and two dimensional action but also a suggestion of intellectual and emotional depth beyond Asimov and perhaps knowing that the second movie version of Dune was being released the same year. Asimov's easy to read, comprehend, and follow written narrative has become a visual feast but much more convoluted, harder to follow, but sometimes a tenderly edgy experience that may be worth watching if detached from its original source material.",

The first episode had some elements of Book 1 , especially regarding Seldon and psychohistory, but we then fall into a bottomless pit of gimmicks, tropes, meaningless and at times childish dialog, shallow characters, and cinematic cliches none of which have anything to do with Asimov and Foundation. The problem is not the cast and certainly not the impressive CGI effects, it's THE SCRIPT! Even if I had not read this series and others by Asimov, I would be hard pressed to get engaged in this mess. The Expanse is great because it doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is....a good space western. Apple's Foundation takes a great work of Science fiction (one might even say literature) and reduces it to pretentious drivel...After listening to Sheldon's \" I owe it all to you\" speech in the laundry room, I decided to cancel my Apple TV subscription.As for the \" wokeness\" others have criticized, it matters little to me.

Of course it's not entirely fair, because \"Foundation\" has over 10 hours to tell their story. But the biggest difference is, that in \"Dune\" the visuals and the (complicated) story totally dominate the rather soul-less characters, while in \"Foundation\" is it especially the personal development of the characters that forms the main focus of the story.Thanks to the ample duration of the series the complex narrative gets enough room to become comprehensible, and the CGI is absolutely awesome. But it's the personal histories of Gaal (Lou Llobell) and Salvor (Leah Harvey), of brother Dawn (Cassian Bilton) and his sinister, scheming brother Day (Lee Pace), and of the sad robot madam Demerzel (Laura Born) that to me made this series so impressive and involving, not in the least thanks to the fabulous acting, which made their stories and characters at many times deeply moving.I was very much impressed and cannot wait for a next season!",

A show which doesn't preach, insult or attack it's audiences or tries to force-feed a specific message of anykind. It is a series that is unabashedly entertaining, interesting and a pleasure to watch start to finish. The themes and ideas of this show are woven into the storyline and plot points as well as the journey of the characters. No empty virtue signalling or moral grand-standing here.\"The Terminal List\" is an edge of your seat mystery-spy-action-thriller with a healthy dose of revenge seeking thrown in there, one that while not necessarily breaking any new ground (there are other similarly-themed series and movies of varying levels of quality) still manages to feel fresh and put it's own spin on the genre.The show is not necessarily an easy watch and is at times grim and darkly-themed. But that is part and parcel of the story and the different paths the characters have to undertake. Which is also what makes for such compelling viewing.Some may point to perhaps the overly long run of the episodes. I personally, do not mind that one bit. The series is eight episodes long...and you actually get your money's worth. I am sick and tired of these series that are only six to eight episodes, where individual episodes sometimes a have a forty minutes or less runtime...looking at you Disney Plus! Besides, this is actually a positive, because it allows the show to breathe, the story to unfold properly and the characters to actually develop in a meaningful way.In addition, perhaps most importantly, this a very solid, well made, cast, acted, written and directed series. I am aware that it is based on the books by James Carr (I'm assuming this series will get more seasons), which I have not read. It speaks to the effectiveness of the series, that it draws those like myself, who have not read the source material, to this world and characters. Of special mention is the pilot/ first episode, directed by Antoine Fuqua himself, who puts on a clinic on how to properly start a show and set the tone. Chris Pratt is no doubt a standout here but by no means the only one. Taylor Kitsch, Constance Wu, JD Pardo, Riley Keough, Jane Tripplehorn, Jay Courtney are all good in their respective roles, as are others not mentioned here.

Theres a ton of modern day messaging under a thin veneer of a \"post apocalyptic world\" that also pulls one out extremely easily. Bethesdas influence on this show is very apparent. That fallout 4 assault rifle was tragic. Over a hundred years after the bombs fell and nobody has tried to rebuild in a serious way? Shady sands anyone? Stay far, far away from this normie slop if you have any reverence for the source material.",

But, the embodiment and spirit is alive and well through the eyes of Lucy McLean (Ella Purnell) a vault dweller who hasn't had to experience real adversity in life.If you've seen \"Blast From The Past\" (1999) a lot of this will be familiar. Though not as dark, it took the simple sweet naive character of Brendan Fraser and put him in real world Los Angeles. Same here. Except MUCH darker.The humor is dark as well. What director Jonathan Nolan did so well is to incorporate a sense of futility in the lives, similar to game play.The lighting and camera work are spot on to the game. You can tell they REALLY studied it. A lot of places, if you've played the game, will seem very familiar. But also, it's just different enough where you don't roll your eyes thinking it's all fan service. He integrates small things like Cram and Nuka Cola with such ease, it's almost like the meme where Leo DiCaprio keeps pointing at the screen to get your attention.The eye popping primary colors of the 50's/60's era is in full swing. If you can't tell the difference between film and digital, this puts your eyes to ease. Clearly this was a film shot movie. Glossy in texture, they lean into the fringe edges.Not that any viewer would intellectually care, but you really feel the Wasteland.Again, if you played the game, you know how many worlds they can explore here.'\nActress Ella Purnell plays the wide-eyed vault child perfectly. She's sweet and wholesome in a newly brutal world. Similar to Sandra Bullock's portrayal of Leona Huxley in \"Demolition Man\" Though not necessarily excited for a bygone era.The characters she encounters only beefs up the idea of how over her head she's gotten herself into.The setup does feel a little rush. It begins with just absolute brutality. Yes, this is introduced. But, it really plays like the game. Where violence is dismissed quickly. If you haven't played, it's going to be a little off-putting. But it does make sense. It took me off guard for a moment. The idea is to get that open world feel and this series does it perfectly.This is one of the video game series I am absolutely excited to see continue. There is SO much to mine and I'm ready for it.Well done all!",

            "review": "THIS is how you make a video game to movie/tv show series. THIS is how you pander to gamers while appealing to new audiences. THIS is excellent 21st century entertainment.I won't waste time explaining the premise, I'm sure you've gotten the gist by now from other reviews. Just know that it seems like gamer who are fans of the game series (such as myself) are quite happy with it, and that people unfamiliar with the game series (like my wife) are also engrossed with this show.SO MANY REFERENCES to the game makes it fun to watch as a long-time gamer fan. Everything, from junk decor like magazine racks and plastic jack-o-lantern buckets, to power armor, enemies, factions, food, chems, characters, and weapons, is familiar.Sure, it may be a bit overproduced, have some cheesy and weak CGI effects, and contain a lot of the \"modern formula\" in its script and story. Aside from that, it's got everything anyone would want for a riveting sci-fi, action, drama, comedy, horror adventure. Seriously, this show, like the game series, covers all the bases.And oh my goodness, mini fan-gush moment here, but, I was so excited to hear Matt Berry's voice, I was totally not expecting it, and it was an awesome cameo as one of the easily recognizable robots in the universe of Fallout. And let's just say his is not the only shocking and awesome cameo in the series. Fans of shows like Archer might be pleasantly surprised in Episode 6.What's also so cool, is that like the stories you run into in the game, there are a lot of really interesting plots with crazy twists. The vaults may seem more like a paradise than on the surface, but when you dig deep, sometimes, the vaults are scarier than reality under the sun...Fallout has been around for two and half decades, and it's taken them this long to finally come out with a tv/movie adaptation? You know what? Since they nailed it, I'd say it was worth the wait.",

            "review": "Like many other reviewers here, I am a diehard fan of the Fallout games. My introduction to the game series began 25 years ago when I picked up a copy of Fallout 2 and I've been hooked ever since. Never, in all that time, had I ever wished for a spinoff TV series to be made about it. Who asked for it? Not me! But nevertheless, here it is. It exists whether we like it or not and no matter how many negative reviews people submit based on pride, protest, or principle it will not change that fact. Look, no one is forcing anyone who strongly objects to this series to watch it (not yet anyway). But if its mere existence truly offends you, just don't watch it! What is there to gain by coming here to thumbs down positive reviews because you are so aggrieved? Anyone and everyone is free to ignore the show, just like I'm choosing to ignore the sense of entitlement these petty review-bombers have by giving this new series the glowing review it rightfully deserves based on the merits.With that business out of the way, my review here is for anyone with a sincere interest in this series in deciding whether they should give it a chance. And to that I say yes, absolutely you should whether you are a fan of the games or not. As I previously mentioned, I never asked for this show and was prepared to hate it. But I kept an open mind as I watched and did my best to be fair in my overall judgement. And the truth is, the show is actually pretty fantastic. I was not prepared for it to be as good as it is. This show definitely caters to fans of the franchise with its high attention to detail and faithfulness to source material. I sympathize with those who would have preferred that Hollywood not make the series in the first place, but at the same time, now having watched it, the hate towards it is pretty unjustified if the only crime is that it exists.To the angry Fallout fans I ask you this: Imagine a TV series is being made about this game that you and I both love. Imagine that it's completely out of your control, and production is actually happening. If a Fallout series HAS to exist, what exactly would you want it to look like? Would it not be similar to exactly what Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy have created? I mean, visually it's pretty spot on. They've built an immersive world that feels very authentic. It feels like Fallout, it looks like Fallout, and it sounds like Fallout. Okay, maybe you would have preferred the show was modeled after the Interplay games and not Bethesda's Fallout 4, or maybe you would have preferred the show runners double and triple check the accuracy of the lore because you find any cannon inconsistency unforgiveable.So let's address the elephant in the room: Yes, there are some glaring lore issues. But it doesn't bother me. Why? Because a TV series is a different medium for storytelling than a video game. For the sake of argument, let's assume this new series runs for 8 seasons with 8 one-hour episodes each. That's a total of 64 hours screen time. That's just a fraction of what most people put into playing a single game. I've put hundreds of hours into Fallout 4 alone. When playing a game, you have the luxury of time to explore it and study it as much as you like. That's the beauty of Fallout games. But television doesn't work that way. It's not interactive. The entertainment comes from literally just sitting in front of a screen and watching/listening to a story. Viewers are going to tune out fast if it becomes overly pedantic and boring. Sometimes it is necessary to truncate and/or modify original source material so that it translates better on screen and can hold the viewers' attention.For me personally, as a longtime fan, what mattered most was that the series captured the spirit, message, and immersive atmosphere of the games. No matter what, it needed to look and feel like Fallout, and Nolan and Joy nailed it. I don't know what more they could have done to make the series better than it is, and I'm honestly relieved that the creative liberties taken were not so egregious as to disrespect the entire franchise and its fanbase. On the contrary, they've done an excellent job here. They could have reimagined Fallout into some truly terrible fan fiction, but they didn't. It feels like a true extension of the Fallout universe and that's all I had hoped for. Jonathan Nolan made this series because he is also a fan and avid player of Fallout games. If anyone could pull it off, it was him.",

But somehow, the show manages to be both boring and forgettable.The problem is that Fallout is all style and no substance. The characters are all one-dimensional stereotypes, and the plot is predictable and cliched. The show also suffers from a serious case of tonal whiplash, veering wildly from comedy to drama to action without any real sense of cohesion.As a result, Fallout is a show that is easy to watch but difficult to care about. You might find yourself watching an episode and then immediately forgetting everything that happened. It's the kind of show that you'll never binge-watch or even rewatch.It's a shame that Fallout is such a disappointment. With all the talent and resources behind it, it should have been a lot better.

This show does a really good job of nailing the feel of the games, with it's mix of gore and wacky humour.All three protaganists are interesting to watch but I particularly liked The Ghoul, who had a strong backstory, and the Vault Dweller, who's naivety made for quite a few laughs.The locations in the show were styled on the game and were true to the game. Although, they were all smaller locations. There were no wanderings in large, destroyed cities. I guess that would have meant a bigger CGi budget, so it's understandable.Also, it would have been nice if there was more danger in the wasteland created by the multitude of creatures from the game. This felt a bit neglected in the show. Again, I suspect this would have added to the budget. Perhaps these small quibbles could be rectified in Season 2. Surely there will be a Season 2 as this first season is surely going to be a success.I absolutely loved the way the plot threads came together in the last episode. It was really satisfying and leaves room for the story to continue.One last point. I've played and been a fan of all the games over the past few decades and find the 1-star reviews from fans of the game to be very strange. What are your expectations? You have to give the writers the chance to tell a story about characters in the Fallout World and they've done that very well. The set designers, costume artists, etc have nailed the style too, so how can this be a 1-star show? Insanity!",

Sure, there's a general plot that is followed in each episode. Unfortunately, the writers don't seem to want to actually tell a good story, they just want to set up individual scenes that are loosely tied together... and don't even get me started on the plethora of plot holes and inconsistencies.On a positive note, the show does a good enough job of capturing the look and feel of the Fallout world. However, it does not seem to populate that world with all of the enemies and monsters that you would find in the game. It gives you a few ghouls and radroaches here and there, but the actual Fallout world is teeming with these, as well as an abundance of other nasties to be dealt with.Overall, I was very disappointed with this because, as the title says, I expected greatness and I got mediocrity.",

The over the top gonzo violence and the retrofuture dystopia are also straight from the game. The series song choices of 50s crooners set to a new context also is true to the game.

I've played it a few times when visiting a friend, but I never owned the game myself. And this was about 25 years ago. The only thing I remembered was it involves armed vehicles.I went in with low expectations given the terrible history of video game movies/shows. But we have been on a good streak lately (Sonic 1/2, Mario, Gran Turismo). And I'm ecstatic to say that the streak continues with Twisted Metal.It hooked me immediately. I love the tone and over-the-top nature. I love that it doesn't hold back with the violence and blood. I love all the comedic attempts, with so many of them being memorable. I love the two leads, I didn't know Mackie could play funny/slightly goofy.But the thing I loved the most, and it's not even close, is SWEET TOOTH!!!! He's so awesome. I've never liked clowns. Never been scared of them. Just never saw the appeal. So for me to like him this much is saying a lot. The show is elevated every time he's on screen.At first I couldn't tell who was voicing him. I kept wondering, who is the actor fully bringing this character to life? Who is the one making this sadistic psychopath so likeable? Of course, it's Will Arnett. What a beast. He's able to bring so much to the table with his voice, as we've already seen with his performances as Lego Batman and BoJack Horseman.(EDIT: I should have my Nolan card revoked for forgetting about Joker in The Dark Knight. But I never really saw him as a clown. He's more like an endlessly intriguing character who dresses like a clown. But if you include him, Sweet Tooth would be second.)This show is highly efficient. It doesn't meander. It does so much with so little time. Most shows these days are terrible at that, especially streaming ones. I also love the song selections on this soundtrack. Some are late 90's/early 2000's songs I love and still listen to. Others are songs I haven't heard in decades. The choices seem odd but all work. Never in a million years would I have thought a scene playing the Thong Song would give me goosebumps.In conclusion, YES and GIVE ME MORE!EDIT: On second viewing, it didn't hit as hard. I still enjoyed it but not as enthusiastically as the first time. Changing season 1 rating from 8 to 7 stars.Season 2: 3 stars (1 viewing, 8/28/2025)Wow. What a nosedive. I hated this season. I had to force myself to finish it. I can't explain exactly why, but here are a few things that contributed.-For a game where they're meant to kill each other, the frequently don't. And I'm not talking about the ones that are friends. So much of this season doesn't make sense in general.-They jumped the shark with how goofy it is. Vermin is the best example. Horrible.-In season 1, Sweet Tooth was menacing and beastly. In this season he's unintimidating and kind of a joke.-In this hell of a post-apocalyptic world, so many of the characters are good guys, working towards a righteous end. The show feels more nice than sadistic. We already have thousands of shows/movies with righteous characters. This should lean way heavier on the sadistic side.I'm so bummed. The only standout positive is the look of some of the car battles with cool colors, lightning, etc. I'll probably try season 3, but I'm not confident we'll get one after such a drastic nosedive.",

In fact only a few minutes worth in 5hrs. Most combat is on foot and poorly executed. Very few characters from the franchise appear and when they do they're wrong. Sweet Tooth was ok but ruined with wretched dialogue. Very bad writing and acting, poor casting- Mackie has the comedic timing of a gnat fart. Feels like a nickelodeon show written by 12 year olds. There's over the top acting and then there's too over the top acting. Barbie has good over the top acting, this does not. Hope it gets canceled.",

            "review": "Alrighty then. Well, I had no idea that they were turning this particular vehicle game into a TV series. And as I stumbled upon it by random luck here in 2023, I must admit that my initial thoughts were 'great, another game adaptation doomed to fail'. And let's just be honest here, as much as I enjoyed the games, there just isn't enough contents in terms of storyline to support something like a TV series. But bless director Kitao Sakurai for trying.And of course I opted to sit down and watch this TV series. However, after the first four episodes, I must admit that I was good and ready to give up and call it quits, because this was a drag and very disappointing. However, I opted to stick with it, and actually managed to sit through all ten episodes of season one.Episodes five, nine and ten were worth watching, the rest? Not so much. Yeah, for a ten episode TV series based on a game where the concept is vehicle destruction and mayhem, you would assume that you would get that in an abundance on the screen, right? Right! Well, wrong, because you hardly have that at all. Instead, you get a sappy soap opera set in a dystopian setting. And that just didn't really play out all that well.While \"Twisted Metal\" was supposed to be John Doe's (played by Anthony Mackie) and Quiet's (played by Stephanie Beatriz) show, it ended up being Sweet Tooth's (played by Joe Seanoa and voiced by Will Arnett) show. Hands down, it was the clown Sweet Tooth that carried this TV show, and he wasn't even in every episode.The dialogue had a lot of dark humor, which definitely added to the overall enjoyment of the ten episodes. Again, even with the dialogue, it was Sweet Tooth that carried the series.\"Twisted Metal\" from director Kitao Sakurai hardly does the games any justice. So don't get your hopes up. But then again, basing a TV show on the meager contents there is to the games, well that was just simply boiling soup on a flat broth.Visually then \"Twisted Metal\" was fair enough. I wasn't bedazzled or overly impressed with the special effects and CGI in the series, but it was sufficient and adequate enough for what it was, taking into consideration the premise of the TV series.I can't claim that season one was impressive or particularly entertaining, but at least it leaves the audience with a promise of turning future seasons into what the audience (and fans of the games) were waiting, looking and hoping for; vehicular violence and roadrage.My rating of \"Twisted Metal\", at least this first season, lands on a generous four out of ten stars.",

Even crying is pathetic and so fake. Everything looks really cheap.And now lets see what Twisted Metal is really about (and no, there are not one spoiler in whole description):Twisted Metal is a demolition derby that emphasizes the usage of ballistic projectiles, machine guns, mines, and other types of weapons (up to and including satellite-based weapons and nuclear weapons). Players choose a vehicle, and an arena-or a series of arenas in the story mode-to engage in battle with opposing drivers. A variety of weapons and upgrades are obtainable by pick-ups scattered throughout the stage. The last driver alive is the winner.Although each individual game features its own storyline, they all revolve around the eponymous \"Twisted Metal\": a vehicular combat tournament hosted once a year. In almost all of the games, the host is a man called \"Calypso\"; in the series' fourth installment, perennial contestant Sweet Tooth briefly takes over. The general goal is to destroy all opponents; apart from the other contestants, unique vehicles seemingly designed by the host themselves may stand in the competitors' path. The winner is brought before the tournament host, who will grant the contestant a single wish.The hosts of these games are the persons who are, through arcane means, capable of warping reality itself to grant the wish of the contest winner; however, there is a general \"be careful what you wish for\" theme in the game series, as nearly all of the winning contestants end up with \"not-so-happy\" endings, due to the skill and proclivity of the hosts for twisting the words of their wish around-often to deadly effect. The games in the series usually contain a healthy dose of dark humor.Update for season 2: Stopped after first 5 minutes and removed from all to watch lists. So the TV Show that is \"bassed\" on one of the most iconic video games can't even show that video game properly and making complete joke showing some \"sim rig\" that does not make any sense?I fell for it in season 1 waiting for something related to the game expect one character and the name I am not gonna waist anymore time on this bag of ....",

The trailer left me feeling like it looked ok, but would probably still be a let down. Just some cheap script they made to try and cash in on something.But I was wrong. The series is great! Alot for us Twisted Metal fans and alot for newcomers. They did a good job at turning a videogame series about car fighting into a series, with people on top of it. There were people in the video games of course but just characters, you just drove their cars.I will say this series is NOT meant to be serious or deep. It's just a fun entertaining ride of adult mayhem. Cars, guns, gore, language, action...etc. I'm only a few episodes in and loving it!I'll change my review later if for some reason the show becomes terrible. To note, you really don't need to know anything about Twisted Metal games to watch this.-now finished series-\nFinished the last episode and can say yes, the whole season was great. No spoilers but there was alot of reveals in the last two episodes when it comes to famous TM stuff. The final episode felt much like a actual TM battle.The series does have some pretty cheesy moments. But it seems to work in favor of it. I know they greenlit a season 2, I hope we get introduced to more characters/cars.While the show mainly focuses on the characters, there is just enough TM content that keeps us fans invested. And if you don't know TM lore, you probably will get all the exciting things you see. You will enjoy them, but the reveal may not mean as much to you.This all said I wouldn't mind if they toned down the cheesiness just a bit. While the show can be dark, I'd like it even darker. Twisted Metal Black had a very dark nature to it. Maybe next season they will get into the darker lore. Granted so far the series is filled with violence, gore, language so its NOT for kids in anyways.Oh and hint... next season will be more like TM then you realize.... ;)",

It doesn't take itself too seriously, it doesn't try to do anything over the top. And it doesn't spend endless time trying to explain why things are what they are. They just go for it, hard and fast. I loved it. They finally made a series that was true not only to the spirit of the games, but also to feel.The story revolves around a guy named John Doe, and a girl named Quiet(at least for now). They meet in the wasteland of a world where the only real stable places are cities surrounded by walls. Between those cities is no mans land where everyone basically tries to kill everyone else. However that's where the \"milkmen\" come in, they're drivers who deliver packaged between the walled cities. And so the story begins.10/10 this adaptation did everything right, good cast, good crew, good plot.

Taking its title from Confucius's cryptic saying, the plot of this Spanish-language production revolves around the disappearance of two young girls on what at first seems to be a typical night out at the local carnival. But when one of them is soon discovered dead, her body found in a bag at sea, evidence of her rape and murder changes the nature of the investigation, while still begging the question as to where the other teenager is.Two years pass and on the second anniversary of the murder and disappearance an updated television investigation sparks new interest and hopefully new leads in the case. Step forward the main protagonist of the programme, the missing girl's devoted grandmother, a piano teacher who doted on the girl. She it is who turns into a Spanish Miss Marple, especially when she discovers that a key witness is actually one of her own students, although the lesson she teaches him is of a more deadly nature and very un-Marple like.Even more determined now to get to the bottom of things, she hooks up with the revengeful father of the girl who was killed, who turns out to be a ruthless crime boss. With many a twist and turn ahead of them, one in particular meting out summary justice to an especially inane daytime TV host (yay!), both separately and together, the pair gradually unravel the mystery of what happened that fateful night and finally learn what happened to granny's granddaughter Veronica, before arriving at a cliff-hangjng, indeed cliff-busting conclusion.As stated earlier, I enjoyed the depiction of the local settings as well as the fact that the story was condensed into three rather than the usual six, eight or ten to which these stories often run.The story however I found to be somewhat contrived and clichéd, borrowing too much from too many previous major and TV movies, not to mention TV series dealing with similar subjects. Whilst I appreciated the occasional touches of black humour, for me there were too many identifiable moving parts and coincidental plot points for the programme to really cohere.Tapping into the recent trend of popular dramas (\"Mobland\", \"The Thursday Murder Club\") featuring older actors in major roles this rather conventionally shot and acted production nevertheless made for pleasant if hardly compelling viewing.",

Good mystery so far and there was a twist not related to the crime which was shocking but makes sense in the proceedings. So far the only detraction is the pining of the ex wife who obviously still cares for him but settled for some boring dude.

However, the pacing is a little off, it feels somewhat rushed, with key plot developments and character arcs lacking exploration, which will tend to leave you wanting more depth. Despite these issues, it's engaging with a blend of suspense and emotional resonance, making it captivating. Give it a shot.",

The plot is a different thing. At the end you can't help but ask yourself what was the core story to begin with: the Caleb story, the Lucy story, the drug subplot... The problem with convoluted plots is that they get too twisty for their own good, and as a screenwriter and novelist myself I know what I'm talking about. The main character, a federal agent in charge of crime investigations in national parks, never connects with the viewer, or with other characters for that matter; not once he allows himself to even grin, never. His detachment from everything, except from his obsession to solve Lucy's death, puts us off from his emotional core as a human being. We care more about Vasquez, a normal person, or even Jill, his ex wife. Main characters don't need to be too complex or traumatized to be interesting, especially if they have to solve complex crimes. What about just doing their job in a professional and efficient way without spending too much time brooding? Direction is functional, acting won't earn them any awards, writing wants to be clever sometimes, and there are even some magic realism touches. All in all is a quite pleasant series to watch, but 4 episodes might have done it just as well. 7/10.",

It also gives a slight nod to what happens to people who fall through the cracks, and how easy it is to fall.Good parts: The first two episodes are the best - it does go downhill a bit after that, but the other episodes are still pretty good. The landscape is gorgeous. The people look real - they are not fake looking, which is nice. The actors are great, all of them. Writing is good.Bad parts: The murderer doesn't feel right. I get the point, the cracks have to be shown, and the decisions the murderer made were selfish and led to a crappy life led by the victim, who had no chance. But the whole investigation was a big \"so what\" at the end. Also, it's tiring, that whole renegade cop trope.But it's very good. I cried. More than once.

The film is shot well and visually it stands out but that's where the praise ends. The storyline was weak, dragged out and never went anywhere meaningful. Characters were shallow and forgettable with no emotional depth or growth. I couldn't connect to anyone or anything. It felt like the actors themselves didn't believe what they were saying. Nothing felt real or impactful. Just a bunch of slow scenes with no soul. I kept waiting for something to happen, some twist, some real emotion, anything, but it just stayed flat the whole time.

Sure, the production sent a cameraman there to film some establishing shots. But as a Boy Scout who has hiked all over that park for years and could walk the park blindfolded, it's incredibly obvious that it's really filmed in Vancouver, BC. There's so much wrong with the park's portrayal I won't go into. But if you're going to set a series in an iconic world-renowned location you need to get some of the details right. And really, at that point why not just set the series in either generic unnamed Yosemite-like area or just make up a fictional park. Probably the only detail I appreciated was that the murdered girl was from my hometown of Merced.Other than that, it's just a forgettable cliched murder mystery. There's nothing setting it apart from the hundreds of other murder mysteries coming out. Mysterious body, personal tragedies that somehow tie into it, new mysteries uncovered, main characters secretly involved. All the usual stuff that has become overused by now. I correctly guessed who was in on it by the end of the first episode, it's so predictable.The dialogue is dull and stilted. I saw one review accusing the show of being written by AI. I don't know about that, but it certainly feels that way. There's good actors but they seem to have trouble bringing this stuff to life.As I said, there's good actors in the show. But, as Stephen King said, you can't polish a turd. Eric Bana and Sam Neill have done amazing work, but even they can't get this off the ground. Kyle is stoic to the point of lifeless. It never once seemed like Kyle and Jill were once exes who loved each other. Vasquez is every Hallmark movie cliche about a woman who leaves her husband rolled into one. Everything with her ex-husband with cliched to the point of cringe-inducing. The relationship between Kyle and Vasquez is the same exact thing every other movie/show has done between the tired veteran and overeager rookie.I will give the series some credit. The mystery stuff is okay if you don't mind the overused story and wooden characters. The British Columbian scenery is shot beautifully. I won't remember the series a week from now but it's a somewhat decent way to spend a few hours.",

Then the Spock with a face that exudes self irony, and a voice that does not match the ironical baby face. Then the crew - good for having women - by do they all have to be so obnoxious? I mean, being a woman, am I allowed to wonder why objectifying women in the past excluded the average looking ones in favour of the sex bombs, and non objectifying them in the present shows excludes the average looking ones in favour of the weirdly looking ones? Probably not allowed to wonder about that, so, moving on... Why are the credits written in a font that makes the viewer unable to see and read the names?! Why is the plot so thin and full of propaganda?!Again, using a SF show as an allegory for current times issues may be OK, but the talent and artistic take are in showing it and making people think about the connections, not just telling it, like the propaganda department of the unique political party in charge... and in ST. SNW the propaganda was told, and it came off as awfull, and showed how not in contact with the masses psyché some people seem to be... Yep this planet is going to the toilet, slower or faster, rather faster than slower. But what is even worse is that the people have stopped hoping for good things, feel powerless, weak, poor and robbed of their lives! Saving the planet might work, in a close shave, but saving humanity or the people... nobody seems to care.ST seemed a franchise that cared about life, and people... this new iteration makes me really wonder if it was the old series that fooled me, or if the new ones have strayed off the initial path...

It addressed issues of psychology and emotional intelligence. It worked to connect various timelines. It did not take itself too seriously, at the right times.Stories that leaked about series development, indicated that Anson Mount had a number of conditions, for taking the role. I am pleased that he persisted and persevered, and has taken the rigid \"starch\" out of the captains uniform -- present in every series after TOS.I am also VERY impressed with the rest of the casting. And, I hope they explain why the bridge is mostly female -- which is absolutely WONDERFUL! The rethinking of Nurse Chappel's character is compelling. The casting of Babs Olusanmokun as the Doctor is genius. Christina Chong as security chief (a position that didn't exist in TOS) brings a spirit reminiscent of Cara Gee in The Expanse, and manifests Gene's vision realized in ST:TNG.Let's face it, ST:TOS was full of mistakes, inconsistencies, and many rediculously bad stories. ST:SNW isn't perfect either, but is clearly making the best effort yet.And yes, screenwriters of today are less literate and don't do their homework or research. ST:DIS confused flaunt with flout, and now ST:SNW confused com (communications) with conn (control). Even other reviewers spelled it wrong. To err is to be human.

Instead of focusing on a suitably fascinating science-fiction plot, SNW starts by clumsily pushing numerous irrelevant and unengaging personal backstories of the crew.Strange New Worlds should be mainly about STRANGE. NEW. WORLDS. Instead, it already seems more interested in introspective themes and left-wing political narratives ABOUT. OUR. WORLD. It reeks of political bias and soulless corporate \"creativity-by-committee\". The whole alien plot was little more than a passive backstage for all of the above. THIS SHOW IS NOT ABOUT STRANGE NEW WORLDS.Context: When I saw the title \"Star Trek Strange New Worlds\" I thought maybe. Just maybe. It wouldn't be a political outlet, that they learned from fan outrage over ST-D and \"Not Halo\" that they would restart with a fresh approach. But it is 2022 Paramount so I didn't have my hopes up.My conclusion is that Paramount weighed these factors long ago but just doesn't care, as I am no longer the target audience. Sub cancelled.",

I watched Deep Space 9 until the end (only 1 episode truly memorable) and I finally gave up on Voyager after about 3 seasons (what took me so long?). With Enterprise, I got as far as 2 characters smearing anti-radioactive goo on each other and thought, \"If I want to watch porn, I'll just watch porn \". I managed 1 episode of Discovery and 2 of 'Picard'. Whatever Star Trek has evolved into, it is not what beguiled me 5 decades ago. It has become the mouthpiece of writers and producers that believed Star Trek was all about social commentary and not science fiction or drama, with a little social commentary interspersed.So, now we have SNW - it looks OK, although the CGI for the title sequence is a bit dodgy and heavy handed. When will CGI effects teams ever learn that less is more? Still, the Enterprise looks familiar and although the shuttle in the opening sequence looked cartoonish ( especially when April stepped off it) I can accept that it, overall looks ok more times than it does not.The actors are fine. Anson Mount is a good choice for the part of Pike and manages to convey some of the jaundice that Jeffrey Hunter created in the character originally. Ethan Peck sounds so much like Leonard Nimoy, (with slightly more appealing looks), that I hope he takes over from Zach Quinto (who just looks pissed off all the time) in the movies real soon.So, with some good ingredients in place, what is missing? Well, look to my above criticisms of Trek since TOS and you find your answer.The opening sequence is peppered with social commentary. Pike lives in a house littered with 'antiques'. His ship's communicator lies next to an antique handset phone (presumably not connected or working) and his house in rural Montana is powered by a wind farm ( several giant wind towers required just to power his house?). So, the notion that older, simpler times were better and that Wind Power really is the energy answer for the future because it is still around in the 24th Century. Please.The premise of the whole episode is presaged by Pike watching 'The Day the Earth Stood Still'. Since this was the most interesting part of the episode I kept hoping they would return to it. Not directly. Instead, the writers paraphrase it and insert images of the recent White House riots to illustrate the beginning of WW3 on Earth. Not subtle and a political statement of the kind the original series was always wise enough to steer clear.Then there is the schmalz. Characters behaving as if they are excited to 'Go Boldly' when I presume that's what they have trained for over the past few years. Can you imagine a Communications officer on a modern day Aircraft Carrier going all goggly eyed upon hearing the order to leave port? TOS portrayed Starfleet Command as a military style organisation, which makes sense since discipline is required in order to survive such a venture. With each subsequent series, Starfleet increasingly has become this boatload of wide-eyed kids that follow orders only when they choose to and constantly wear their hearts on their sleeves. Also, why does every security chief have a background of being orphaned in a hostile environment? Good grief, get real SF writers handing in scripts and maybe we can get some originality back in this show. However, I'm not holding my breath for that to happen.Unfortunately, the course for Strange New Worlds appears already set. A shame. Rather than lecture to its audience, the producers and writers could have chosen instead to entertain.",

In fact, it's one of the more emotionally intelligent crime dramas I've seen in a while.Carl Mørck and Akram Salim are the core of this show, and what makes it sing. Their relationship is neither flashy nor sentimental-it's tense, layered, and quietly magnetic. There's a clear echo of the classic Sherlock-Watson structure, but inverted and humanized. Mørck is a brilliant but emotionally broken detective-not a quirky genius, but a man hollowed out by trauma, leaning into detachment as a survival mechanism. Salim, like Watson, appears at first to be just the grounding presence-but there's more beneath the surface. He gives off a very specific \"ex-military intelligence\" vibe-composed, perceptive, precise. You can feel that he's been trained to watch, not just speak.Even more compelling, though, is how closely their dynamic mirrors Disco Elysium's Du Bois and Kitsuragi. Mørck is the Du Bois figure: emotionally adrift, steeped in failure and regret, piecing himself together through the process of the investigation. Salim, like Kitsuragi, is measured, observant, and unfailingly competent-the quiet counterweight to Mørck's mess. Their relationship is not about dominance, but mutual orbit. Salim isn't just the \"sidekick.\" He's the moral compass, the tether to reality, the one with dignity. And unlike many genre pairings, their mutual respect grows rather than being taken for granted.As for the complaints floating around:\"It's too stylized.\" What does that even mean? The green-tinged grading gives the world a sickly, bureaucratic decay-it's a choice, and it serves the mood. This isn't meant to look \"real.\" It's meant to feel wrong, like something's festering under the surface. Mission accomplished. (Also, what's that about criticizing a show because the color grading doesn't look real, is that a thing now?)\"The office is an old toilet.\" Yes. That's the point. Dept. Q is dumped-literally-into society's waste bin, abandoned and forgotten. It's metaphor, not bad set design.\"Characters are unlikable.\" Not everyone has to be likable. They need to be believable. These people have been scraped raw by loss and guilt. Their walls are up. Watch long enough, and you'll see the cracks-and the humanity.In the end, Dept. Q isn't here to dazzle with twists or cater to nostalgia-it's here to sit with the mess. It's a show about grief, institutional neglect, and two men learning how to function while carrying unbearable weight. It's slow, yes-but deliberately so. The silences speak. The spaces between the action matter. If you're looking for a slick procedural with one-liners and gunfights, look elsewhere. But if you want something moody, character-rich, and quietly devastating, this series doesn't just deserve a watch-it deserves to be felt.",

Nine episodes on one case, it didn't hold my interest and I found myself fast forwarding during parts. The problem as usual is the script. Did the writers get paid by the episode? If so it behooves them to write a lot of episodes. Three cases and 3 episodes for each case and that would have held my interest for 9 hours. Every week crime dramas get solved in a satisfying way in 90 minutes, in movies and on TV. I really didn't need to know about Morck's ex-partner and her son, the writers just ran amuck in every direction.I like quirky Morck, but that's not enough to support a series. The rebel cop who does his own thing and fights with his bosses and co-workers, but solves cases is so cliched. It reminded me of the TV series \"House, MD\", with a similar cliched lead character. These characters only exist in the fantasy world of TV and movies. Morck has some good one liners that will make him popular with the fist bumping bros, they'll eat it up.The first 4-5 episodes moved at glacial speed, we didn't get really into the case until the 5th episode onward. All the research should have been done at the beginning by Morck's team and we would have heard about Merritt's money. The police work wasn't done right and that's on the writers. I found it annoying that they constantly cut back and forth between Morck and Merritt both past and present.I roared with laughter when Morck and Hardy were talking on a mobile phone, while Morck was in the hyperbaric chamber. Mobile service is spotty in rural Scotland anyway and when on a remote Scottish island while in a hyperbaric chamber, LOL. More of the fantasy of movies and TV.I like the cast a lot, kudos to the casting director. Always a fan of Matthew Goode, Kelly Macdonald, Shirley Henderson, Jamie Sives, Mark Bonnar, Kate Dickie, Steven Miller... At least the ending wasn't a bum's rush like many series, we got some resolution at the end. If there's a season 2 and it's another single case for 9 episodes, I'll skip it.",

The mystery is drowned in shallow melodrama, and there's little to no chemistry between the actors.This is no Bad Sisters, no Why Women Kill, and certainly no Big Little Lies.

The production values are polished and cinematic, blending premium K-Drama aesthetics with an American-style spy thriller. However, the action sequences fall flat. Fight choreography is slow and overly cautious, gunfire sounds weak and toy-like, and knife and baton impacts lack any real weight. Environmental destruction is underwhelming, and stunts often feel telegraphed, breaking immersion in high-stakes moments. Additionally, some of the non-Korean actors deliver performances that feel stale or flat, which weakens the overall impact of certain scenes. Had the action been faster, more dynamic, and paired with heavier, impactful sound design - including Korean-style cinematic fight sequences Butterfly could easily have scored 8-10/10. As it stands, it's worth watching for the story and strong performances, but weak action, pacing, and inconsistent acting from non-Korean actors hold it back from reaching its full potential. So with that being said, I give Butterfly a generous 6.5/10 because, while the story and some performances were solid, the slow action, weak sound effects, and uneven performances from non-Korean actors kept it from being truly enjoyable.",

We're told David is an elite agent, yet he has no go-bag, no secured safe houses, not even something as simple as a forged passport. Tradecraft is nonexistent-he feels less like an operative and more like a suburban dad caught in cosplay.The action sequences are equally hollow. Where Bourne uses pens, magazines, and taxis with gritty improvisation, Butterfly gives us generic car chases, knife fights with too many flourishes, and Rebecca's constant smirks that drain every ounce of tension. It's all style, no substance-action scenes that look choreographed rather than lived in.Psychologically, the show fumbles again. Jason Bourne was haunted, layered, believable. David and Rebecca? One is inconsistent paranoia, the other a \"smirking teen assassin\" stereotype. The emotional beats play more like daytime soap melodrama with pistols than a gripping espionage story.World-building is paper thin. There's no convincing spy infrastructure, no sense of a global intelligence machine. Just pretty backdrops, some melodrama, and occasional gunfire. Instead of espionage with stakes, we get \"family therapy sessions with prop weapons.\"If Jason Bourne is an apex predator of spy thrillers, Butterfly is Jason in Psycho with a potato gun and a sulking sidekick. A waste of film-yawn-worthy action, ill-prepared agents, and a smirk so overused it should have its own credit in the cast list.",

Within its first 8 minutes of run time I could tell I had found something special here in Stranger Things.Its intriguing story gives information at a great pace and I never felt myself getting confused of bored and there were enough twists or turns to keep me interested. This also had some rather great horror sequences and their use of lights flickering while yes a common trope fit so well in to the story I was on the edge of my seat every time the crackle of electricity shot through my speakers and the lights flickered.The characters of the show are the true stars here, I loved every single one of them. They were all great with amazingly interesting flaws and the way they mix and clash with one another was fun to see unfold. They certainly help to carry this show although I would say that the government antagonists of the show felt a little flat and under developed and not nearly as memorable.Production values are also quite good with some beautiful cinematography, editing, lighting and sound. My goodness I loved their music choices. I would say that the CGI does look a little obvious and from time to time I did notice some issues where the scenes didn't look quite up to scratch. I do think however I've been spoiled for visual quality since Game of Thrones so I would take that criticism with a grain of salt because it certainly didn't detract from the overall experience. The setting and style of everything in the locations where also great to see and felt real and interesting. The way everything was shot also captures every moment expertly and really helps to draw out those story moments with greater emotion.Stranger Things is one of those special shows that I stumbled across and after the opening I knew I was hooked. Its exciting dark tale is expertly woven through its 8 episode run time and I know I will be back to re-watch this one. The ending is fairly well rapped up with a few loose story threads left hanging, with a promise for potential follow on seasons but the story is quite satisfyingly rapped up by the end.

But, as the show progresses, it becomes more and more like a twisted Stephen King story set in a Spielberg movie. It becomes a dark and twisted ride into an even darker and more disturbing world where the stakes feel higher than anything before it.I can't go into great detail because spoiling even just a bit of the story takes away from the greater mystery, but I can say, it's one of the most thrilling and intense series to be on TV, without being on TV.

It's not just the clothes and hair, but the style of acting, the scripting approach, the structure, all hold true to their inspiration. You've got the young nerdy kids, the horny, unsure teenagers, the monster, the mysterious one with the power, the bad science/government people, the conflicted investigator, the tearful mom.You could argue that this entire season is simply a pastiche made up of recycled elements, and I wouldn't disagree, but it really feels less like a copy and more like something of that era, as though the writers had fallen into a coma in 1985, woke up and got to working.While it doesn't have the high style of the Spielberg films that are a primary influence, it does have the likability. The story is consistently engaging and fun, the acting is excellent, and the movie has sufficient laughs and tears to satisfy.",

The acting was bad, the script very amateur, the sound/noise very irritating, the cinematography horrible, the story weak and confusing, and the whole thing just a mess. I kept watching all eight episodes thinking that based on all the rave reviews surely there was something I was missing here. I think this might be among the worst TV series I have ever watched. I had heard the Duffer brothers interviewed on NPR's \"All Things Considered\" and I was drawn in thinking this was going to be great. I need to exorcise this somehow from my weekend. It was a waste of time and looking back painful to watch. I realize people have different tastes and clearly many people love this series but I honestly have to differ and can not recommend it at all, even on a very boring day with nothing else to do.",

With the exception of a few of the adults most of the cast was unknown to me which only adds to the level of immersion the show can reach. The two performers I was familiar with, Winona Ryder and David Harbour are both magnificent. A few things about Stranger Things are extraordinary and could only be done by Netflix. One, this show is suspenseful and engaging so waiting for a week to see the next episode would change the entire dynamic and would really be a bummer, Stranger Things must be binged! Second, the creators of this series are, like the young actors, unknown to me. Matt and Ross Duffer. Brothers that through conventional methods may not have had the opportunity to bring this show to life, get that opportunity from Netflix. In the past few years television has changed wildly. If you were a writer or actor five years ago you would much rather be a movie star than a television star, those distinctions have all but vanished. This change was brought on by many factors but I'd like to take this opportunity to applaud Netflix for their role. It is no coincidence that they started doing their own programming right around the same time these changes began. Bravo and please start filming season two of Stranger Things ASAP!",

How can dribble TV like this be rated so high? Either the world has gone mad, or the ratings on here are just bogus.Now don't get me wrong, I have seen far worse than this show, but have seen far better as well, it is glossy to look at, but it seems to be purely made for teenagers.

            "review": "I guess plenty of people have said a lot of things about all the movie and TV references this series has and how it recreates the eighties in all their faults and splendor. I will not add to that.With the release of the second season I'd simply like to advise that both seasons are very different animals. Think of it as the difference between the original Alien movie and the Aliens sequel: Whereas the first season was more about an unknown and unseen horror and the mystery behind the backstory, the second has more in-your-face action and horror laced with character development arcs which feel nice but sometimes sidetrack the series a bit.Consequently, a fan of the show should probably watch the second season as a separate work of fiction rather than a true continuation of the first season in tone and spirit. The writers move the story forward and we get a very good piece of entertainment but the new season has to be judged on its own merits.EDIT: Season 3 turned out to be a huge change in tone for the series. Maybe it's really hard keeping up the mystery if much of the \"world\" of Stranger Things already yielded many of its secrets but the overall \"feel\" of the series went into a different direction. Maybe the writers simply ran out of 80' templates to rip off. Season 1 was very much inspired by supernatural horror as in \"Poltergeist\". Season 2 took many cues from \"Creature Features\" like \"Gremlins\" or \"Aliens\". Season 3 now uses elements of 80' zombie flicks and low budget gore horror with a little bit of spy comedy mixed in (and fight scenes which feel straight out of \"Die Hard\"). All those genres didn't really mix well in the 80' and this strange cocktail sure doesn't work today. That doesn't mean that Season 3 is bad. It simply relies on characters who were established in previous seasons which used very different 80' story elements and tropes. It's almost like seeing Darth Vader in an Indiana Jones movie. Both work on their own but not together.Basically, Season 3 is an all too transparent attempt to plough a fresh nostalgia field but it doesn't work in the context of previous seasons.",

The first inaccuracy is that the women did not cover up their upper bodies until the missionaries came and made them cover up...but you can't have all the women topless in this series...ha. Many scenes with actors are not filmed in Hawaii, but I guess it's hard to get known Mauna and the backgrounds of scenes without CGI or getting rid of all the current buildings and architecture. You can also tell that many extras and background people are New Zealanders and such. I wished they had used more extras with real Hawaiian bloodlines (the scene where they embarked on O'ahu's beach for battle was obvious). I don't know why they couldn't use more Hawaiian \"locals\" for parts. It was funny to see \"Aquaman\" and his dad, Tom Curry, share leadership scenes together in this series....I was born on Maui, went to high school on Kauai, but unfortunately missed my junior year of Hawaiian history. Hopefully this will be on spot and a good for all to understand da early days of the islands...before England, U. S. and settlers took over, of course. Strap in...I feel this is going to be a good series.Cinemography/editing is decent but typical without creative angles. Music is decent, but it would be awesome if they used more light chants in the background to intensify action or dramatic scenes (Kahiko, Auana, Hapa Haole, etc.).

Mobland fails spectacularly on this front. Almost every single character seems to be competing in some twisted contest for Most Unbearable Human Being. Watching them is like being trapped at a family dinner where everyone's armed and emotionally unavailable.Let's start with Maeve - mother, grandmother, matriarch from hell. She might just be the most infuriating character on screen since Joffrey Baratheon. At least in Game of Thrones, even the psychopaths were compelling. Here, it's just pure, relentless toxicity.What's baffling is how Mobland seems to have learned absolutely nothing from the greats. In The Sopranos or Peaky Blinders, you witness people doing horrific things - but you care about them. You understand them. There's depth, contradiction, broken humanity. In Mobland, the characters are just... horrible. Not flawed, not morally ambiguous - just flat-out repellent. And not in a fun way.The writing seems to think edge equals interest. But without empathy, there's no tension. Just noise. You're left watching characters commit violent acts without remorse, nuance, or purpose - and following the show becomes painful.There is one bright spot: Tom Hardy. As always, he brings a level of gravitas, unpredictability and wounded charm the rest of the cast can only dream of.

It reveals itself in stages, as each two-dimensional character, in turn, suddenly displays real depth. It's like watching popcorn, wondering when the next kernel is going to blow, always a little surprised by which one it turns out to be.The humor is pervasive, and the writers didn't settle for (only) the obvious \"hey, remember, I'm actually dead\" jokes. The laugh-out-loud moments, for me, were much subtler - like in the news video showing a group of headless bodies as they are encountered by first responders, one of whom slips a pulse-oximeter on a corpse's finger.My wife and I pretty much binged this series in about three sittings.

Then he lets her go and we jump cut to a shot of the girl upside down on the couch. HAHA! The comedy genius of this moment is breathtaking. Absolutely brilliant writing folks.The writing is flat, out of touch, and oddly off-base considering it's supposedly a tech focused plot.

The division between Wall Street, Native Americans, and a rich land baron who happens to be a rancher is all being played here. The only commonality among the disparate parties is greed. If Costner is trying to be the righteous defender then he's doing it primarily for his own designs as he's painted in the initial episode. That gives him that special JR Ewing sauce. So is it a soap or a statement against squandering natural resources?I see a well-financed new stab at a family soap here. The cinematography is rich using what appears to be Wyoming as a decent stand in for Montana. Certainly there age some good things. I hope the show becomes more real + actually giving insight in how the ruining of what is left of pristine wilderness is playing out That's not as likely as a whole raft of dark back-stabbing will likely be the plan.

While the acting from Costner, Reilly, Hauser, and Huston is solid, the writing and general directing leave a lot to be desired. This thing moves like a soap opera without being of interest. Too much here annoys me, and beyond the writing and general direction of the show, coming in second in the annoyance department is the character Kayce and his annoyingly present son. Throughout season one in its entirety nearly nothing happens that isn't contrived - and that's just how the show feels. One silly episode synopsis read something about John Dutton's secret, which is brought up as a concern, regarding elections, by a governor to a AG candidate (which is not John Dutton) - it's utterly absurd. And that's this show. Absurd. Driving with your son, have a gun in the glove, and see a strange van on the side of the road? Well, of course you go full vigilante with your little irritating son present. And of course this character is a SEAL - cliche? Stick a fork in it.

His way of life is being impinged on by resort developers, tribal rights, and the authority of the state of Montana. Reminiscent of Rock Hudson in \"Giant\", he is trying to hold on to the old ways.\"Yellowstone\" develops quickly with little introduction, yet its story unravels with the natural pace of a wilderness day, pausing for tribal rituals, cowboy conventionalities, and political machinations. It's a far flung undertaking that dwells on the seams between laws and justice, family and friendships.Costner fills his character's boots naturally, it seems. He is a world-wearied man who has seen too much and lied too often. The land and the family are his lifeblood. He can hear the footsteps coming his way, but he can only fulfill his role-out of habit as much as loyalty.Although some action is a little confusing due to lack of explanation, it feels natural, as if the viewer is getting a genuine slice-of-life glimpse into another world. I hope the resolution of this saga includes an emotional payoff that justifies its breadth and its attention to details.Update 7/20/18: After four episodes, this series has a strong voice and a persistent rhythm. We learn the fullness of each story, from roots to fruits. I am increasing my grade to \"9\".",

I'm also glad that Bruiser and Sarah are being given a backstory and more involvement into the plot as opposed to the book.

Centering around the life of one Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. One is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge New Jersey Mafia group, of which he is the boss of both. Played by James Gandolfini, of True Romance and The Mexican fame, Tony is a fascinating, scary but also likable guy. Full praise must be given to Gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man. Contemporay American drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as Tony.The cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will stick in your memory for ever.The true genius of this tale however, is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series. Twenty minute long dream sequences, powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence. Yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love, honour and respect for family. The series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous.With TV now competitive and often poor The Sopranos stands tall above the rest as America's most original and compelling drama.

            "review": "The Sopranos mythology is as close an analogue to Greek mythology we'll ever get in modern life. It's all there. The archetypes of Zeus, long-suffering Hera, oracles, sibyls, the virginal Persephone, Zeus' seduction of mere mortal women (who can be destroyed by it), the messengers and functionaries of Zeus, the wandering eye of the Most High himself, on and on it goes. AND there are the deep emotions and passions that go with it.Greek and Roman mythology has become so quaint to us we \"teach\" it to sixth graders and sent them to see Disney productions of Hercules as an example. (Disney doesn't tell you the one about when Hercules batters one of his wives kills her and slaughters his children--I think that's the way it goes.) The schools don't \"teach\" about the mother who chops up her own children (whom she loves) to bake in a pie to feed to the husband she hates.They don't \"teach\" the crazed women who mutilate the man who scorns them. Or the girl who arranges to sleep with her own father. What passes as the Greek myths in schools is really just kind of bullshit. Or...isn't there one where Zeus makes love to a mortal woman who wants to see him in his \"true form\"? She burns up or something. Tony does that too, to the car saleswoman. What about the dancer at Bada Bing? I haven't got to the end of the art gallery girl yet.But The Sopranos really approaches the bloodthirst of the Gods, their cruelty, their indifference to mere mortals...and their so, so human traits mixed in with their almost unbearable inhumanity. But don't forget they sometimes show great wisdom and kindness too. The Gods and the Sopranos mingle with us mere mortals, but we say a little prayer of thanks when they pass us by. They know things we don't.Personally speaking, when I think about \"the mob,\" they seem to have the sort of reality to me (or your average Joe) of being sort of \"out there\", just like a forces of nature, and I don't ever want to get them mad at me. I know I just might brush past them every once in a while, I'm sure, but I would hardly know it. If a mobster came to me in disguise, just as the Greek Gods were used to doing with mere mortals, I hope I would treat him in a way so as not to invoke his wrath in consequence. As a child, I felt about the Greek Gods with the same sense of mystery and heightened imagination, believing they were \"out there\" and about somewhere, but one just never really got to see them up-close.Now, I'm pretty sure this analogy to the Gods in The Sopranos is not done purposefully by the David Chase...he might have an awareness, sure, he's incredibly smart, but he's NOT making allusions to specifics...it's not an algorithm. Or (gods help us) an homage. He's just being true to the subject material in the best way he knows how--and it's absolute dynamite. It's no surprise the Sopranos reaches directly back to the Greeks. This kind of gradiosity and passion BELONG to the Sicilian and Italian culture (Sicily was an outpost of Ancient Greece) and have done for thousands of years. For Chase NOT to \"go there\" with the violence and sexuality would not be possible.The greatness of the Greco-ROMAN myths lies precisely in their depth of presenting vividly, exhaustively, splendidly, the all-too human capacity for evil (among other things). The myths are the extremes we are all capable of if pushed into passion. David Chase's genius is that he has crystalized our cultural fascination of gangsters into a mythology worthy of the Greeks. I think his take on the mob is BETTER than Puzo or Scorsese. He somehow (consciously or unconsciously, I don't know) recognized the archetypes involved, intimately, and ran with them.For anyone who thinks The Sopranos glorifies violence (as one dude posting here felt), that person needs to take a survey of literature or something. God, read Shakespeare. Take a course in history. Hell, look to Iraq. We live in a violent world. Learn how to digest story and context. Constantly, the show presents the REALITY but then, always the consequences.The pleasure of watching this show is that the barrier of the TV screen protects us. I think the writers are constantly reminding us of the moral dimension involved. The Sopranos is at the bottom of it, deeply moral. It's about actions, and codes. If you get hung up on the violence, you probably had better watch something else and leave it at that. Go drink some Kool Aid and chill.Here's a suggestion to deepen the Soprano experience. Get out the tragedies and original sources (not Edith Hamilton!) and read them, thinking of the Sopranos. And conversely, if you know the myths already and want to see them truly brought to life, think of them when you are watching The Sopranos. You'll see Zeus. You'll see Hera. You'll see all kinds of Gods.(Look again at his mother who wanted figuratively to eat him, just like the Titans tried to eat Olympians.) The parallels are absolutely chilling.If they wanted to pack the opera houses these days, they should get all the conductors and opera directors to watch The Sopranos en masse. That might revive opera overnight. Opera houses should just go back to the beginning and revive some of those very old operas and learn a few things from the Sopranos. Opera actually began in Italy as a movement to recreate and revive the grandeur of Greek tragedy. Interesting, hm? Look what it's come to. Sad.Pavarotti would sing a HELL of a Tony Soprano...as a Tenor of course.It's too bad some people don't 'get it.' They don't see, at bottom, The Sopranos is really about moral choices and consequences; it's BEYOND entertaining (it fascinates) because it parades all the deep and dark things most of us never ever have to take resposibility for.It's truly Great Drama.",

However, instead of seeing Tony as just a one-dimensional thug, we see that he has a life outside of his criminal activities, and that's what makes this show different from it's competition. It's a different side to the story of criminals, that they have normal lives when not breaking the law. The entire supporting cast is brilliant, especially Edie Falco, as Tony's wife Carmela, a deeply religious woman who stands behind her man despite all of his sins and Lorraine Bracco, as Dr. Jennifer Merlhi, Tony's psychiatrist; a woman who fears him when she is giving him therapy, but secretly is attracted to him when they're apart. This is indeed \"the show that revolutionized T.V.\" See it!!!",

It has broken all rules, and set new standards for television excellence. Everything is flawless, the writing, directing, and for me, most of all, the acting. Watching this show you'll find yourself realizing that these characters are NOT real. The acting tricks you into thinking there is a real Tony Soprano, or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people don't watch the show because it's violent, it's not all about the violence, it's about business, family, and many deeper things that all depend on what you, as a fan see. For me, I don't like when people refer to the show, a show about the Mafia. For me, it's a show about family. A family who, through generations, happen to be apart of the mob. Overall this is a masterpiece of a show. This is what television should be. Right here. Complex characters from stunning acting, magnificent story lines from brilliant writing, and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? A show that defines excellence, and dares to be different.",

            "review": "Having seen The Sopranos Season 6 episode 17 (aired May 6, 2007) for the first time in a long time (in a hotel room) since watching Season 1 on rental DVD, I remember why I never cared about the so-called television phenomenon that is The Sopranos.It all comes down to utterly contemptible nature of the characters -- virtually comprised of principal and supporting -- that is reprehensible to tolerate, at least from my point of view as a humanitarian misanthrope. None of the characters portrayed is remotely sympathetic to me. Any attempt to depict these despicably remorseless characters through sympathy is emotional manipulation that exploit the viewers' naivete.After that recent (albeit offensive and dispiriting in unadulterated nastiness) episode I saw, I found it pointless and empty to keep watching the series episode after episode, season after season. Why be subject to the continuous stream of gratuitous nudity, revolting violence and endless vulgarity? I know, change the channel, but I take exception to the intentional obliteration of morals (if any) in this show which warrant this comment.I am amazed the TV critics lavish praise on this turkey as if it's the work of art, like USA Today, Entertainment Weekly and numerous publications did. The Sopranos is in fact a mind-numbingly pretentious dribble that go on and on with frequent intervals of violence and wall-to-wall swearing as prerequisite content to entertain the viewers like it's clever and ground-breaking. Please spare me this facetious absurdity.David Chase and his team of telewriters must be pretentious Hollywood (hello, Don Simpson) egotists if they think The Sopranos is meant to depict the facts of mob life in exacting accuracy like it's a geek show. And I get tired of looking at the pretentious advertisement of The Sopranos with the cast staring at the reader in an ad space featured in big name magazines and newspapers splashed with exuberant quotes of critical acclaim. And there are the books and interviews with the creator and the cast. I find the interviews with David Chase amusing owing to his penchant for narcassitic charade as a pompous individual in dead-serious tone and demeanor.The Sopranos represent David and his army of hack writers' sense of tvland fantasy as they pile meaningless after meaningless story arc and flat, emotionally manipulative character development punctuated with the roll of grisly violence and depravity passed off as \"meaningful\" entertainment that appear to justify glorification of Italian-American mob thuggery. I found Summer of Sam patently offensive for its nakedly stereotypical Italian portrayal, yet The Sopranos take the cake in unabashed Italian-American stereotype and for this I'm close to feeling animosity towards certain Italian-Americans for condoning thuggery, even after they announce -- albeit hypocritically since some complain loudly about negative stereotype -- that this particular show is their favorite. It serve nothing but Hollywood defecation on the supposedly noble & morally upholding Italian heritage. Thanks a lot Dave.It amazes me The Sopranos found wild success and carried with the wind (courtesy of the media critics brainwashing the public that The Sopranos is \"WONDERFUL...MASTERPIECE...GROUNDBREAKING!\") to continue its run for years. I'm glad The Sopranos is in its final season, so it won't be missed because it sets an example as a television series that pretends to be brilliant philosophy-wise but which don't really mean *beep* but bloodythirsty entertainment for the viewers to pass time every Sunday night reminiscent of the Roman Coliseum.I consider The Godfather one of the best movies ever made for its perfect structure and impeccable mood. Yet The Sopranos tries to out-do Martin Scorsese's mob movies by going over the top in terms of perverse content and shoots itself in the foot by referring to The Godfather like it aspires to rise above the standard through the run of several seasons dispensing philosophy of life & family while killing innocent people now and then with the methods of ripping bullets and torture for the most trivial reasons besides shock value.The Sopranos is truly the most mean-spirited television series in existence (reality shows not included) as evidenced by its disrespect for anything remotely noble in the code of conduct reflecting the reality. The creator and producers thrive on the mean-spiritedness of the story concept to appeal to the audience that evil equals good and so it must be entertaining, irrespective of the innate depraved nature in inhumane attitude and dispiriting animosity towards all that is decent.It's also the most overrated television series of all time. It's praised for all the wrong reasons -- virulent misanthropy probably massively appealing to the critics who secretly hate the audience for the sheeps they are as they get paid handsomely for writing flattering reviews and articles.David Chase, the producers & the telewriters -- shame on them for the garbage that's condescending and regressive that serve no point at all but make gold for HBO in promoting the profound contempt of civilized humankind and mold the public's attitude to favor the mean and nasty. No wonder America is one of the meanest and dumbest nations on Earth, especially on the East and West coast where there is considerable cult following of The Sopranos for another variety of Tony or one of the associate thugs biting off a live chicken's head every Sunday night each new season.Tony Soprano and his band of thugs being caught, indicted and imprisoned, with the majority of them sentenced to the death row would be a fitting end to this dismal, morally braindead series. There's nothing human about them -- they are monsters disguised as mere human beings deserving of heroic compassion as envisioned by David Chase and his cigarette-dangling, laffe-sipping hack writers wearing black turtleneck shirts & hip frame eyeglasses hammering out drafts packed with creative mob violence in the safety of their cozy Hollywood Hills homes.Zero star out of four",

This is almost genial! Let Kurosava comes out of the other land to commit again harakiri looking at these series! Let me count out the low downs:First, the script. Almost all the episodes consist of violence which is put there just for the entertainment; the mob bosses are present as normal human being, there is absolutely no reality in none of the episodes with minor exceptions. All in all, this is inept remake of Good fellas + Scarface + The Godfather (may God forgive me for the blasphemy of putting this sh*t in line with these fine movies!)I don't know why the common intelligence in the American audience has fallen so low to accept this turd as an entertainment and to praise it as if it is the totem of film making, the only thing ever created since God created Earth.The sole idea of depicting criminals as good fellas and to glorify them as heroes is rotten from the bottom of it.

The Sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time.James Gandolfini plays the enigmatic New Jersey crime boss, Tony Soprano, accompanied by a stellar cast. Edie Falco is superb as the worrying, loving upper-middle class mother; Tony Sirico is tremendous as a superstitious, greying consiglieri who is often very funny.While the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of Italian-Americans as mafiosi, and to an extent this is undeniable, I can see so many positives from the show. The portrayal of strong family values, friendships, love and compassion; could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters? Yes. Furthermore, other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs etc. This is no shallow, dull show about tough guys and violence. It has so much more. Many of the issues we see on the show are very real.The writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters' lives, which makes the whole thing more interesting.Credit must go to David Chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to James Gandolfini, for envisioning, television's most complex and enigmatic character.Simply exceptional.10/10",

In most cases, these shows are being deservingly dumped in the summer because most of them are terrible.

Even though it seemed like it might have been, it ended up being one of the better shows to come along so far in the 2000s. The show is about four friends who own a bar in Philadelphia. At first glance, it doesn't seem like anything special. The owning a bar scenario has been done several times before in a variety of other sitcoms including \"Cheers\" and the recently canceled \"Grounded For Life\". However, since the show is more clever and much funnier than the previous sitcoms who have used the device, one can forgive the lack of originality.What makes \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" better than any other of the sitcoms that are on today is the clever writing. The writing on sitcoms these days is beyond awful. The writing on \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" is great. In fact, if the show doesn't receive an Emmmy nomination for writing, there is no justice in the world. The three episodes that have aired so far have been incredibly well written and unlike with most sitcoms, the dialogue doesn't seem like typical sitcom dialogue. The dialogue comes across as natural as opposed to coming across as forced like on network sitcoms and other cable comedies.

In the same fashion as Seinfeld and Arrested development, this show deals with a group of unlikeable misfits while they engage in moronic adventures based in equally moronic impulses. The difference with those spiritual predecessors is that Sunny takes it a step further. As the tagline of the show indicates (\"Seinfeld on a crack) the writers of this show not only embrace the selfishness of their characters but takes it a step further by completely severing their social awareness and empathy towards other human beings. The result, needless to say, is not only sometimes disturbing, but utterly hilarious. Here is a small introduction of each one of the characters:-Dennis Reynolds: A malignant narcissist in its truest form. Dennis believes he is the closest to physical perfection a human can achieve. A reputed ladies man, he is not above using alcohol, lies, emotional abuse and even the implication of danger (if they say no) to get girls in bed with him. He shows great amusement by watching how other people might get hurt by his actions, even if those people are his friends or his sister (who he constantly refers to as a bitch).-Mac: Dennis's best friend and roommate, he equally enjoys to be part of the gang's plans even if that means hurting or offending innocent people. He even benefits from Dennis's system to pick up and seduce girls, because Dennis let's Mac hit on them when he gets bored with them. Mac believes himself a skilled martial artist (Even if he has not taken one lesson in his whole life) and enjoys resolving problems with violence or vandalism.-Charlie: Although equally impulsive and alcoholic as the other's in the gang in many ways, he is the only one who has shown he has some empathy for his fellow human being. He spends his time drinking beer or huffing glue (yes, he huffs glue). Being the most naïve from the group he is easily manipulated by the others, although he has shown he isn't above manipulating them either. He is highly resentful and is prone to violent outbursts.-Deandra \"Sweet Dee\" Reynolds: Dee is as manipulative ad his brother and has been shown as only motivated by her own agenda. She is heavily picked on by the others on the gang because of their misogynistic views. Although as the other characters of the group, specially his brother, she shows no regard for how other people might be getting affected by her actions. She is highly vindictive and she goes to great lengths to make sure her schemes and her lies are being bought by the people involved.-Frank Reynolds: An impulsive, violent and eccentric ex-millionaire he is highly delusional and carries a gun all the time. His likes include prostitutes, drugs and ham (Yes, ham). He is highly irrational and is always looking to crazier and more idiotic ways to deal with the possible issues that might arise for the gang.This show appeals to your inner child in the way that this characters really have the mental development of a child, and you will find hilarious how they will impulsively engage in idiotic plans without showing any preoccupation of how the consequences could be for them, their friends or for the people unfortunate enough to get involved with them. Is a refreshing show because it is one of the first comedies that embraces the darkness of its characters and the comedic possibilities of having a group of alcoholic, impulsive, borderline criminal, but dim witted protagonists. These are highly unlikeable people, and their humor might offend you in one way or another, but mark my words: You will enjoy every minute of it.",

            "review": "There hasn't been a show in the world that makes me laugh as hard or as often than It's Always Sunny in its prime. Seasons 1 through 5 have some of the best, sharpest comedy writing in ages. Since then, the show hasn't been as consistently brilliant, but there are gems in every season. The premise is very simple. It's about the life of four Philly bar owners. At least until season 2 brings in the father of siblings Dennis and Dee, Frank Reynolds, played to perfection by Danny DeVito, where it becomes a fearless fivesome of hilarity. The thing is, these aren't your ordinary people. They're delusional, narcissistic, borderline-psychotic idiots. The show has been described as \"Seinfeld on crack\" and that's about as good a descriptor you can get. The gang are always coming up with ridiculous schemes and stupid ideas which consistently result in awkwardness and belly laughs.One of the best parts of the show is the characters themselves. They come across as shallow douchebags most of the time, because for the most part, they are, but they each have their own distinct personality that mesh so well with the others. Dennis Reynolds is about as close to an everyman that you can get from the gang, and he's a manipulative, insecure, raving sociopath. His sister Dee is almost as depraved but with more self-loathing and less psychopathy. Their father Frank is a rich businessman who traded that life away for living in the slums as a lascivious alcoholic. Specifically, he shares a bed with Charlie, the illiterate, idiot savant wild card of the group. Dennis' roommate Mac is an oblivious closeted homosexual that favors badassery above all else. To put it lightly, they get themselves into some interesting scenarios. Whether they're all together or broken into various group combinations, you can guarantee laughs are to be had.The chemistry between the actors really sells the whole thing. Rob McElhenney, Glenn Howerton, and Charlie Day are geniuses. Their writing, their acting, it's all so natural and infectious that you can't help but get immersed into any zany idea they come up with just to see how the gang comes out the other side. Kaitlin Olson and Danny DeVito are just as much necessary pieces to the cast. The humor ranges from uncomfortable to terribly politically incorrect, and that's the beauty of the show. It takes these \"delicate\" topics and shines a light on them that many people are afraid to address. The first season alone deals with racism, abortion, transsexuals, and child molestation. And no matter the topic, they find a way to make it hard-to-breathe hysterical.I can boast about this show for days, but the fact is you either enjoy the humor or you don't. There's a lot of yelling and plenty of curse words, and it may be grating for newcomers to dip their toes into something like this, especially if they don't know what they're getting into. But for those who do and appreciate clever unrestrained comedy, treat yourself to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.Great intro episodes: (#3.9) Sweet Dee Is Dating a Retarded Person - (#2.4) Mac Bangs Dennis' Mom - (#2.3) Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare - (#4.10) Sweet Dee Has a Heart Attack - (#4.12) The Gang Gets Extreme: Home Make Over Edition - (#6.3) The Gang Buys a Boat",

What this show lacks is the straight man. These are all deranged, despicable individuals. The closest would have to be Glenn Howerton's character, who is an insecure, self-absorbed, conceited narcissist. There is no comedic balance between the characters, and the jokes are ribald, cheap shots at minorities and the disabled without any good timing.This show is compared to Seinfeld, which is beyond me. Despite their flaws, all the protagonists on Seinfeld are somewhat charming. Elaine's wit, George's cunning, Jerry's sarcasm and Kramer's philosophical rants is what makes these characters so appealing. Mac, Sweet Dee, Dennis and Charlie are just unpleasant morons that lack any real savvy or intelligence in anything other than conning other people with their hair-brained schemes. There is not much difference in any of their persona, which makes it unbelievable, stale and awkward to watch.Empathy is a key ingredient in any comedy, and I cannot relate to any of these characters at all. It's unsettling to watch an idiot like Charlie scream (with such bad overacting on Day's part) when he doesn't have his way or when he wants to get his point across, much like a petulant child throwing a tantrum. Neither is funny and frankly, it gets on my nerves!",

The only thing that guy does is get on my nerves with his overacting and hyperactive behavior. I don't understand how anyone can think that guy is funny. It's like being in the loudest part of a psychiatric hospital and i don't consider being there as funny.->Then you have Glenn Howerton and Kaitlin Olson. They are both equally bad. They're also quite invisible in this show, so there's not too much to say about them.->And then you have the 'mastermind' of this show Rob McElhenney. I have to say, maybe in another show and just as an actor maybe he can be funny ,but in this bad written show (by himself) he's just not good.I first watched 5 seasons of this show because I thought it would be as good as IMDb-reviewers made it out to be, but I was so disappointed that I almost want to cry.

It may take another solid season for this show to cultivate a substantial core audience. But it seems FX is willing to stick with it long enough to find out. Even if FX decides to run this show up against the big boys (CBS' \"Without a Trace\") in the fall, Thursdays at 10pm is a perfect time slot. Sunny is gritty and dark at times, but in a harmless and smart kind of way. Kudos, FX...This show is a winner!",

Emotional scenes fall flat, action sequences lack urgency, and even basic conversations feel forced and unnatural. It's hard to care about characters when the actors themselves look like they don't.The writing is the show's weakest point. Clichés are piled on top of clichés, with no originality or nuance. Every twist is telegraphed from a mile away, and the attempts at \"clever\" dialogue are cringeworthy at best. It tries to be edgy and intelligent, but ends up feeling like a cheap imitation of better thrillers.Overall, Countdown is a frustrating waste of time.

Something about conspiracies, government agencies, a mysterious past, and a countdown to... who knows. Probably the end of your patience. Every episode promises high stakes but delivers something more like a flat energy drink: bitter, forgettable, and full of artificial tension.The action scenes are a blurry mess of shaky camera work and shadowy lighting, probably so we can't tell what's going on - or who's still awake.

As Agent Mark Devlin, he brings a layered, emotionally grounded performance that feels both raw and real.

Each episode peels back another layer of the mystery while adding depth to the characters. The supporting cast holds their own, but it's clear that Ackles is the engine driving the story forward.Visually, the series leans into its gritty aesthetic-dark alleys, tense silences, and moments of explosive action all help set the tone. Combined with a pulsing score and slick direction, the vibe is somewhere between True Detective and 24, with a fresh edge.If the rest of the season keeps up this energy, Countdown is set to be a standout in the thriller genre.

Rather than showcasing characters who are smart, insightful, determined, and intriguing, the series prioritizes violence and internal squabbling, ultimately detracting from any potential for meaningful character and plot development.The show appears to sacrifice genuine storytelling for gratuitous action, leaving the impression that the writers gave up on crafting compelling narratives. Instead of allowing viewers to connect with characters through their investigative prowess or their personal journeys, Countdown leans heavily on predictable conflicts and a relentless barrage of violent scenes. This over-reliance on surface-level thrills leaves a void where genuine tension and intellectual engagement should be.For those yearning for a police drama that truly delves into the intricacies of crime-solving, Countdown misses the mark. Imagine a series where an entire season is dedicated to meticulously investigating a single crime, allowing for a deep exploration of the evidence, the false leads, the breakthroughs, and the sheer determination required to bring a case to justice. Such a show would highlight the intellectual rigor and emotional toll of police work, rather than resorting to superficial theatrics.Ultimately, Countdown is a missed opportunity.

The characters already seem to be well flashed out and I quickly became invested in their stories and what they are going through. The cinematography is really beautiful and Los Angeles really became its own character in this. Jensen Ackles as a lead is doing an amazing job. Mark Meachum is a complex character that really is going through some dark stuff in his personal life. And Ackles portrayed that struggle beautifully. Amber is definitely becoming one of my favorite characters. And I really enjoyed Eric Dane character as well. Can't wait to see what's next.",

It's a bit like a mockumentary.I really liked Lip in Shameless, so I'm happy to see him back in a good show. And yes, I can see It's a well made show, production wise, in acting and in art-production. It really sets the vibe well.But somehow I just have a hard time to get into this story or characters. It's all brought overly nervous and a bit hyper, especially the first few episodes. I'm somewhat conflicted on how the people respond to Carmy's presence. Sure, there's some bad blood with his cousin and It needs time to adapt to his different perspective of running a kitchen, I got that. But at the same time he's like one of the best chefs of the world and there's no respect for him at all. That takes away from the dynamic of hating the change, but respecting the man, which makes It feel a bit one-dimensional to me. It's all very focused on the conflicts and overly dramatised which doesn't rhyme with the \"realistic\" approach.Also, nothing really interesting happens. It's mostly just a thing that breaks in the kitchen. A hole in the wall, a machine that broke, toilet that leaked etc etc It's not very interesting writing. It's all about the packaging that tries to make It original.It's sort of entertaining, but I wouldn't call this a comedy. And that's fine, but I just wonder what part of It is supposed to be funny.I guess It's just a group of people I have a hard time to relate to, The way they do and talk, what they say, It's all a bit whatever. Which is key for a show that's mostly about the characters. Storytelling is all over the place, so you just pick the information randomly along the way.I want to like It, but I don't really so far.",

I've miserably pushed through the first season, and really wish I wouldn't have wasted my time. This show manages to simultaneously give the vibe that it was written by someone who grew up watching scripted bad reality tv shows about manufactured kitchen nightmares and has no idea what it's really like to run a restaurant like this, while it depicts everything wrong about restaurant work that CAN be changed and fixed. I could write a novel about the absurdly bad writing (the table-less bar-style 80s plastic menu board greasy spoon takeout restaurant that sells italian beef sandwiches \"doesn't do to-gos\" and instead employs a full staff to sit around and make small batches of time-consuming fine french fusion dishes with no wait staff), but frankly it's too annoying to think about. The first two episodes include no plot development or character storylines and is simply filled with people screaming over each other the entire time. I cannot understand what anyone says. The extras angrily scream \"CORNER\" at the top of their lungs every 1.5 seconds -anyone who says \"this is how restaurants work\" has only worked in highly dysfunctional abusive environments and are conditioned to accept the abuse. This is manufactured stress and drama for the show, and it comes off as lazy writing and obnoxious. Why is the container of gravy on top of a box on the top shelf in an otherwise empty walk in? Because they need DRAMA but don't really want to spend any time making sure the scene seems realistic in any way! This show feels like it was written by a kitchen nightmares reality show producer, and has the same lazy writing, lazy producing, \"producers hate their talent\" type-vibe of those shows. The chicago references are terrible and stereotypical of what people who aren't from chicago think everyone thinks/talks/acts like there. The only good thing this show offers is beautiful shots of food. That's mostly what the show is. Close-ups of food cooking. We almost never see any of the characters outside of the restaurant. We don't know their lives. They don't have relationships or kids. They're stressed out drones that are there to \"serve.\" A very elitist view of restaurant workers. We hardly know the characters names, as every 3rd word coming out of their mouths are \"chef.\" Everyone in the show calls everyone else \"chef.\" I don't know where this fascist military-like de-personalization of restaurant staff originated from, but it's demeaning. Restaurant owners/managers/workers who wish to alienate their staff and make sure their business fails should employ this \"calling everyone \"chef\" technique. We all know that what people like the most is being de-personalized and being called by words and names that aren't who and what they are. Big props to the actors in the show, they are the only part that makes it worth watching. I would have quit after episode 1 if it weren't for them.",

ER's are places of extreme excitement, sadness and humor (the rat scene alone beat many comedies made today). It's fun to be a couple episodes into a medical show and looking forward to more instead of rolling my eyes and moving on.Being Hollywood we get the usual moralizing, but most shows lecture while delivering inane dialogue with one dimensional characters.

I didn't think the every episode is an hour (like 24) would work for a medical show but I was wrong. It not only works but is a big reason why this series is so good. The pacing of each episode makes them fly by. No show or movie you've ever seen will prepare you for the experience of watching The Pitt. With how many medical series that have been made it's amazing that the genre was able to come out with such an original show as The Pitt.",

This show captures it all... bravo to the writers, directors and the actors. Well done!!!!Yes, it is really that chaotic, busy and sad.. from the tight-knit group of doctors and nurses, techs, secretaries, EVS and security. We all band together to take care of sick patients, homeless patients, behavioral medicine patients, dying patients, trauma patients, nursing home patients, not sick patients, you name it we take care of it.And we have a thing called ER humor, I really appreciate that the show has captured this because without it we'd cry every day.

            "review": "A few episodes into this show I was in! Despite my overall rating of this show being a 6.5/10 by episode 13, I would give the early episodes and most recent episode a solid 9/10. I thought, wow, a show about the ER that subtly focuses on how the HCPs, patients, and cases reflect the world around them without beating us over the head with a certain point of view - all while capturing the chaos of emergency medicine with a high degree of medical accuracy!Well, the subtle part did not last. I feel like I am a good person to make this point, because not only have I worked in this setting, but also, I agree with many of the social points they're making on a practical level. I just hate when I feel like a show is preaching at me at the expense of narrative & immersion. It's fine for a show to have a point of view, and medical cases are a good vehicle for this, but it starts to feel like instead of exploring interesting characters, this becomes a tertiary focus, and many of the patients and some of the HCPs just become avatars to preach about some social issue. This would still be ok if it was just shown in an interesting way, but the writers have a tendency to preach and write these things unnecessarily into the dialogue, or go too cliche/unrealistic with the scenario.These don't really become a big issue until the middle/late episodes (before things pop off, but no spoilers here) so it can feel a little bait and switchy.There's just WAY too much telling over showing with any social issue, too. One example that comes to mind is an obese patient who was misdiagnosed due to assumptions about her metabolic health, because of her obesity. There's nothing wrong with showing this, in fact it's cool to show how complex diagnosing in this environment is, but after we are shown this and can deduce for ourselves what happened and why it was a problem, we get a doc lecturing another about why they're bad for for doing and why you shouldn't judge an obese person by their obesity. Or the trans woman who comes in and gets called by the wrong name from their insurance, and the doctors treat her with respect in the room. A bit unnecessary story wise but that alone made sense and showed us more about who those characters are, which is great. But then we get one of the doctors stopping her on her way out the room talking about I'm sorry your name was misgendered we need to do better etc etc. There's no need for these afterschool movie moments - just let the scenes speak for themselves!That brings me to my last point. Some of the acting is bad, and some of the characters are quite grating as a result of this plus some thin writing. On its own it's not a big deal, but with the issues I mentioned above, you need skilled actors to pull some of this off. Dr Robby, Dr Heather Collins, Whittaker, Dr Mel King, the head nurse, they're all fantastic. But for every one of those we have a Santos, Mohan, Javadhi, many of the patients, even Langdon at times, who make this feel like a high school play. These are also some of the more obnoxious characters where it's especially important to have charismatic actors playing them. I mean \"SloMo\" Mohan specifically, you need a certain kind of person with a magnetism to pull off the \"I'm more empathetic than you all\" and \"I know I'm great\" schtick without it being grating and obnoxious.Anyway, this show is still worthy of watching, but I do hope they address some of these issues for S2 if it returns.",

The \"love its\" praised it for what I praised it for (above). The \"hate its\" did not like that you don't have a joke, then a laugh, then a joke, then a laugh. This is an adult satire. When you reviewers write that you can't find anything to like about the characters, THAT'S the idea. You are supposed to delve into why you don't like them. You are supposed to not like what they do (or, if you're a little bit twisted, LOVE what they do). Brilliantly written by Mike White, it exposes the underbelly of people, yet still shows dignified people in the same context. You don't like water breaking? That is a natural occurrence. White mingles humanity with absurdity, and coats it with a sheen of money, power, and humility.

But it's done in a rather ham-fisted way, with characters who incomprehensibly lack almost any social skills, or act cluelessly in what are otherwise pretty normal situations.

The other actors, from Carrie Coon as Bertha Russell to Blake Ritson as Oscar, deliver capably as expected. However, it needs to be called out that the main protagonist, the so-called glue to all characters and all storylines, is played by an actress who is clearly out of her league. The burden of carrying the show falls on her shoulders, and her inexperience and shortcomings are in full view. Louisa Jacobson exudes zero charm as Marion Brook. She fails to make this central character sympathetic which is critical to the quality of this show. For the first few episodes I start to question why she is selected as the main actress as I am perplexed. Then I find out that she is the daughter of none-other-than the great Meryl Streep, possibly the best actress of all time. There must be an assumption that due to genetic association, Louisa has to be just as good. But here is living proof that sometimes the apple can indeed fall far from the tree.",

            "review": "I've been waiting this for a while, especially since Fellowes mentioned it, I knew the premise could deliver a good show, and so it is. I'm giving it a 7* for the time being for I know it could be an 8 but I will reserve judgement until the end of the season.Plus, all Fellowes' dramas are slow burners, even Downton Abbey was a bit much at first, there were dozens of characters presented at once, nothing made much sense until episode 3 so I knew what to expect on that regard but I want to make a defense, should that be the word, of this series. Aside of minor mistakes, façades not being the right stone, streets missing small details, the show presents the age rightly, especially one that was written a lot about, and mostly from a women's feud views. The men offer the backside of this, they didn't care about their wives' issues, they make business in between each other and let them manage the social side of their lives.The show is heavily inspired from Alva Vanderbilt's takedown on Old New York, her bid on becoming socially acceptable agains Mrs Astor's 400, the Knickerbockers. Old ways vs the new way, Americans, especially Newyorkers, finding their footing in the new order where the US was beginning to be a power in its own right, and so, then, of course, the Buccaners, the most famous 3: Minnie Stevens, Jennie Jerome, and Consuelo Vanderbilt, the first 2 ones ran away from NY due to the lack of acceptance their families had, Alva was of a sterner material, first she won at home, and then she placed Consuelo as a duchess in England. Shortly after she divorced her husband, marry the love of her life, and then became an activism for women rights, vote, etc. What a woman, ha!I also disagree with those who refer to this as woke, luckily is not, Fellowes loves to introduce these \"downstairs\" stories, and it is going to be one of the lines to go, so I like that, he is also usually thorough when it comes to details, I mean, don't expect seeing Peggy marrying a Vanderbilt or an Astor, he does not play with history on that regard but there will some surprise there for sure.I hope this one follows its course, it could run for 4 season easily, and more.",

I think the visual production values are very good.The casting/direction/writing for the aristocrats is all wrong with the exception of Ms. Baranski and Ms. Nixon. Why are the old aristocrats written to be so much real and human than the social upstarts, the Russel family? The gay live-in relationship of the Van Rijn/Adams partners is quite unlikely in that period.The portrayal of Stanford White as a wimpy, middles-aged sycophant in his behavior toward the upstart Russells is also bad writing. White was a dashing rake (in his 20s-30s in the 1880s), noted for his ego and bravado. This illustrates the problem of throwing in real historic characters without doing proper research.Perhaps this production shows the growing disrespect for our real history, lived by real people?

            "review": "So here it is at last: one of the most highly anticipated new TV-shows of the year, the spin-off from probably THE most highly praised TV-show in the history of Television. Naturally, expectations were over the roof - and it was a forgone conclusion that meeting those expectations would be next to impossible. Well, here's the good news. Judging from the first couple of episodes, 'Better Call Saul' will be good. Just how good remains to be seen, but as far as promises go, those first episodes made a big one.For those who haven't seen it yet: relax - I won't spoil a thing about the storyline. Instead, I'll concentrate on all other aspects of the show. The first thing you notice (as was the case with Breaking Bad) is the camera. The photography is simply gorgeous. All the visual trademarks I've grown to love so much in BB are there: the playful camera angles; the creative ways to establish even a simple scene with unusual, interesting shots (yet without ever distracting from the storytelling) - it's just beautiful to look at.Then there's the music. From the wonderful introductions (before the opening credits) to the last scene of an episode, music is not just used as background \"noise\": carefully picked songs are there to give clues and are as much an integral part of the story as they help establish the tone of certain scenes. And the original music by Dave Porter feels as organic to 'Better Call Saul' as it did in 'Breaking Bad'.The writing, directing and acting (so far) are on par with BB; anyone afraid this would be a rushed production trying to surf on BB's success can relax; not for a second did I get the feeling this was somehow not well thought through or cheaply constructed by a committee of writers - and although we do of course get some of our favorite characters back, new ones are introduced that promise to be just as original and interesting as the ones that helped turn BB into a cultural phenomenon. And adding high calibre actors such as Michael McKean ('This Is Spinal Tap') to the cast is probably an indication that Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould will not content themselves - or us - by mainly exploring the characters we already know.And then, finally, there's the magnificent Bob Odenkirk. Starting off as a slightly one-dimensional character and comic relief in BB, the character we've come to love as the sleazy, slick Saul Goodman has already shown more layers in the first half of the first season of 'Better Call Saul' than over his entire run on BB. And that's as much thanks to Odenkirk as the fantastic writing: the actor obviously relished the opportunity to show what he's capable of as his character charms, squirms and threatens his way through his scenes, but - somewhat unexpectedly - he also manages to move you during the more quiet moments.To sum up my overall impressions: 'Better Call Saul' is a darkly comic, multilayered story that could end up being just as unusual and exciting as we all dared to hope. The tone may be consistent with 'Breaking Bad', but make no mistake: this is very much its own thing. The writing, directing and acting - as well as the production values - are top notch, and if what we've seen so far is anything to go by, we're in for a great first season of a very promising new show.

            "review": "Let's face facts: Spin-off TV shows tend to fare poorly to the original content. I was furious when I heard about the spin-off to the amazing Break Bad. Nonetheless centering around the buffoonish clown of a character Saul Goodman?! I was livid and heartbroken. I wanted Breaking bad to end on a high note and not let this potential disaster ruin it's legacy.Breaking Bad was an absolute masterpiece of a show, with an amazing story, script, cinematography; you name it, it's there. But the one thing that made Breaking Bad shine, and in my option, be one of the greatest series ever made was it's deep, deep burial into the characters that made us either absolutely love or loath them. It didn't rely on special effects and had no fat to it whatsoever. No other show encapsulated a slow unfurling of characters so well that it was as if we were getting to know them in our real lives.I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot after hating it's first episode on release. I figured, maybe I could eventually forget about the fact that it was attached to my favorite TV show, and when everybody who watches it is telling you it's amazing, there must be something there.. right?Boy, were they right. Better Call Saul is just as good as it's predecessor. It maintains it's very high standard to every aspect of the production, and most of all, character development, motivation and relationships are centerfold once more. It is easy to find Better Call Saul even better than Breaking Bad, although I would chalk this up to it being more current and therefore more in the forefront of our minds in the Breaking Bad universe. If you, like me, have hesitated to give this show a shot for the same reasons, stop it. Let yourself feel uncomfortable for the 1st half of the first season, and then let it get it's clutches into you.I'm so, so very happy I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot again 4 years later.

But unlike other TV spin-off's that are just 'extra' episodes that degrade the original show, Better Call Saul has significant promise as a standalone series that could come to rival it's predecessor.From the very beginning, the show returned me to the universe of Breaking Bad. Not in the obvious ways of reviving characters and settings, but through the subtle cinematography and script writing of Vince Gilligan. The camera focus changes and the interesting angled shots are quite unique to Gilligan's shows. This artistic and cinematic experience that begun with Breaking Bad is now continuing with Better Call Saul, once again proving that television can be as good, if not better than films.The acting in the series is incredible. I don't think anyone will be able to top Cranston's portrayal of Walter White, but Odenkirk forms far more depth in the character of Saul Goodman than we ever see in Breaking Bad. Moving away from just comic relief, Saul is now a darker version of his false identity, and Odenkirk finds the balance between these two personas very well. Hopefully he will continue this standard to give Jimmy McGill a Walter White-like descent into the criminal world.The humor in Better Call Saul is really well done. The show isn't a comedy, but the occasional funny moments are quite akin to what was done in Breaking Bad. The dark, witty wordplay made me laugh quite a few times at Saul's... sorry, Jimmy's lines, with the subtlety of the script writing shining through.The music by Dave Porter once again really adds to the engrossing cinematic experience of the show. The musical choices are reminiscent of Breaking Bad, but are moulded in a very different way to form a lighter tone in some of the more comical moments. The weird and wonderful musical montage songs are back (starting in the first scene), which brings us back to Walt and Jesse's cooking (Crystal Blue Persuasion, anyone?).Gilligan and Gould start the story with quite a lot of missing context surrounding Jimmy's brother Chuck and his law firm. Although this may be confusing in the beginning, I later realized this was intentional. Instead of just spitting out the back story in unnatural ways, the writers make you think about the situations, and gradually piece together what happened before the events of the show. This widens the whole show's time-frame, instead of just being self-contained. The brief flash forward to the fragmented Saul Goodman after Breaking Bad was amazing. I really hope that the writers continue to play around with time, shifting between past and future guises of Saul Goodman.Better Call Saul has a lot of promise to extend itself beyond its Breaking Bad spin-off status. The show feels individual, but also leaves enough Breaking Bad in there to keep us from leaving the world of Albuquerque that we have grown to love.",

Walt has cancer, revealed it to the family, met Tuco, the Tuco attack on Jesse, Tuco kidnapping of the two, Hank killing Tuco, and Walt explaining his fugue state to the family and I still skipped a lot of events.I am currently 11 episodes into BCS and the whole first season could be fit into 2 or 3 episodes. It is short on events and long with takes.There is a scene where the camera zooms in to show graffiti and it takes about 30 seconds to show \"(I) was here\" when it could've done it in 10. There are a lot of mood setting and establishing shots that are made into scenes. A Cinnabon branch's closing routine is shown in full, including locking up the bottled water/juice, taking out the trash, the walk across the closed mall, etc.The events are non-events - James playing with a light-switch is not interesting in any way.The story doesn't seem to be heading in any direction. The episodes end without suspense, cliffhangers or even the slightest curiosity - you simply never feel like you need to watch the next one.I feel as if all this material could've been great as a side dish for a real story.

Am a huge fan of 'Breaking Bad', so was really psyched in seeing its prequel 'Better Call Saul' too. My opinion of Bob Odenkirk is also very high, so there was absolutely no way this was going to be missed. Have binged on many shows in the past seven years or so and was determined for this to be one of them, very like 'Breaking Bad'.'Better Call Saul' was every bit as amazing as reputed. Have seen many shows that started off wonderfully but declined badly in their final seasons, a few with really bad last episodes ('House of Cards', 'Game of Thrones', 'Killing Eve'), but then there are rarities like 'Breaking Bad' where every season was at least positively received and on the most part universally acclaimed. 'Better Call Saul' is another one of the rarities and is the first show seen in a long time to not have a bad episode in it, since 'Breaking Bad'. Seriously compelling and addictive stuff and exceptional in every area.Visually, 'Better Call Saul' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.The writing for 'Better Call Saul' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, although quite talky, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The pull no punches and gritty approach to the subject was often chilling and harrowing to watch. The direction couldn't be better.Likewise with the acting, with Odenkirk on absolutely towering form throughout as one of television's most fascinating and meatiest leading characters, one that one is repulsed by but also one that is not hard to sympathise with in some situations. Rhea Seehorn and Michael McKean are excellent as well, McKean giving one of his best work in years. The character writing is rich and compellingly real.Concluding, truly outstanding show. 10/10.",

It's been a little over a year since the finale aired and I'm still mesmerized about how this crew lead by Peter Gould & Vince Gilligan pulled it off, again.When Breaking Bad reached its finale, it was hard for me to imagine any other show being able to reach it's level, let alone arguably surpass it. And when I heard that there was a spin-off regarding Saul Goodman, I thought maybe the show could have some solid and funny moments, and maybe bring a bit of depth towards some beloved Breaking Bad characters.Spin-offs in television are usually seen to me as fan service, or a way to make more money off of a franchise that was loved. That doesn't mean that all of them are bad, but most of them don't have the passion or care that'd make you think it was extremely necessary to make a spin-off, especially considering the risk of making previous characters look bad writing wise. And while Better Call Saul was AMC's idea to make more money off of the franchise, I'm shocked with how the creators and writers were able to make another masterpiece.This show was always meant to be in the shadow of Breaking Bad in my eyes, and I never would've thought of these shows as something that'd be deserving to talk about in the same breath as one another. But Better Call Saul took the ball that Breaking Bad was rolling, picked it up, and launched it forward.While I think Breaking Bad has peaks that no other show can reach, Better Call Saul was able to do things that it's predecessor never could. The depth and writing of these characters are honestly perfect. So much so that I'd consider the shows leads Jimmy and Kim to be two of the best written characters in television history. And while the cast of this show is extremely stacked, Chuck McGill to me is a character that's honestly overlooked compared to the rest. His character has a pretty clear consensus amongst most people, but there's so much to him and Jimmy's dynamic that's it's honestly not as black and white as most people make it out to be, despite both being objectively wrong in certain aspects of the series. It's really fascinating to me.The main aspect of the show that baffles me is how perfectly timed the arcs are considering this is a prequel. Every event in the show is written so well and is paced in a brilliant way to the point where no character arc seems to be rushed, yet the show still remains interesting. You think you've reached the pinnacle of a characters journey, then a curveball is thrown that changes everything.That's not even mentioning how balanced both the lawyer side and the cartel side of the show are. When I first started the show I was eager to get more of the Mike and cartel portion, but the lawyer side of the story honestly paved the way for the first half of this show and was the most compelling part of the first 3 seasons.My word of advice to anyone who watches this show.1. Be patient\n2. Understand that this is not Breaking Bad.At some point the show will get very intense, but enjoy what arcs you are given at the time because before you know it, you'll look back and realize you were in the good times of the show. If you watch Better Call Saul after watching Breaking Bad, you might ask for one thing early on. But when you actually get it, you'll realize that the destination wasn't the key, but it was the journey to get there.Considering most of the characters in this show were never even supposed to exist, it's safe to call Better Call Saul a miracle in television. Whether that was because of an actor wanting to be written off, an actor having a busy filming schedule, or a throw away line that created two of the greatest characters in the entire universe, it's amazing that Breaking Bad was able to pave the way for one of the greatest shows of all time. But what's even more impressive is Better Call Saul makes it to where Breaking Bad is not even complete without its existence.Kudos to Peter Gould, Vince Gilligan and the entire crew that returned to create Better Call Saul, and I'm grateful I got to experience this universe come to a close.",

They have spent weeks on Nacho switching Hector's medication when we all know that neither one of them dies in this series. It's an intelligence insulting waste of time. The only good thing in the new episode, and this entire season so far, is that we finally see Jimmy's first slip and fall.

There are still parts where is drags, but in general things are finally starting to happen. Still, almost finished with the 4th season and there is still not much going on.And then we get to S04E07 and everything starts to grind to a halt again A six minute intro that tell us nothing. There's another music video of dudes making a meth lab. They are copying some of the iconic music videos in Breaking Bad where thing actually happened.I was just about to bump this up to 6 or 7 stars, but I think that I'll wait.This could have been an excellent series. Instead it is like a house guest who doesn't know when it's time to go home. Three seasons in and the material could have been covered in six episodes. They are just dragging this thing out forever. Just because you have a TV series with ten episodes of 44 minutes (or whatever it is) doesn't mean you can just show someone walking for a minute. Tell a story. Tell stories. Literally, every scene is too long. How could someone write this? Stop wasting our time.If you examine this series you would have to agree that they drag almost every scene along to absurd lengths. Do they realize that you don't actually have to show someone on camera walking across a street, for example? You can just show the person taking a step in that direction and then cut. In the next cut you can show them on the other side. Basic film making.This is a problem with many series and feature films. They have no idea of how much time they need to tell their particular story. I can't count how many feature films I have seen recently that go well beyond the standard 90 minutes, and for no real reason. Netflix cranks out lots of bad movies that go two hours that could be trimmed to 45 minutes, easily. This show is one of the worst (best?) examples of feet dragging. It's excruciating to watch.Just watch the first scene in the first episode of Season 4. It clocks in at a bit over eight minutes. It tells us very, very little. Eight minutes is an eternity. Most comedy series clock in at 22 minutes for an entire episode so thus scene would have been more than a third of a show. This is only one example and I could list dozens and dozens of this same wasting of time.I wish that I knew exactly how much screen time was spent agonizing over Hector Salamanca's heart pills. Jesus, talk about extreme over-kill.",

Supernatural is somewhat endearing in that the main characters (the only ones who will be recurring) are brothers, however, the writing makes the characters more believable. They are different from each other, each with their own take on life and things that are not typical. I think as the show goes on it will continue to get better,though it is great now. I can't wait to see more of this show!Another plus is the little bits of humor placed here and there, which, when done right, is always a plus. Some of the best shows/movies are ones in which one minute you are sitting on the edge of your seat biting your nails and the next you are laughing at some irony or funny statement/joke a character has said. Also, having two very attractive men in the cast doesn't hurt, either ;)",

The  story isn't exactly complex, but the storytelling technique pulls you  in and holds your attention, making you want to know more about the  supernatural beings and the rules that govern their shadow world. I'm  usually not a fan of darkness and horror, but this show is effective.  It's dark urban fantasy and it has the potential to go a long way.

Jared's character was tired of hunting supernatural things. but when his own girlfriend dies the same way his mom died, he decided to hunt that thing. This all happened in the pilot episode. Both brothers are also looking for their father who hasn't returned to them in days. He was on his hunting trip( looking for the thing that killed his wife). This also happened in the pilot episode.

However, I can't help but watch this show every week with a fondness for my old junior high days. For those who don't know I was a huge sci-if/horror geek in my younger years and I loved reading about \"The Crazy Hook Man who kills Teenagers\" or \"The Ghost of the Lady in White\". I ate those stories up, and apparently so did the show's creator. This show takes me back to the years before I learned what character arcs, and plot contrivances were. It strips that all away and just lets me enjoy what it was like to hear ghost stories. What it was like to get chills down my spine every time I rode down a dark road at night expecting an apparition in white to appear. What it was like to come so close to saying \"Bloody Mary\" to the mirror and then passing out. There is a likability to this show that can't be ignored, and there's even some great moments with the two main characters Sam and Dean (played quite well by Padalecki and Ackles) but it is that nostalgic feeling above all that brings me back each week.",

            "review": "Supernatural is gonna draw the obvious X Files comparisons so we might as well get them out of the way now. Its stars are an intrepid duo who travel across America encountering all manner of paranormal phenomena and mythological creatures. It has a lot of ex-files staff too which is apparent if you have watch both shows pretty closely.Supernatural isn't as smart as The X Files , nor is it as cleverly written. The X Files was ahead of the time in many ways and is still unique in others, in that it was a mature drama which took its subject matter very seriously. It managed to blend sci fi and the paranormal skillfully so that you almost didn't notice the seams. Supernatural in a way is like The X Files - lite. It knows what it is and I think is a more focused show then its predecessor. From the get go it lays it out to you that it is situated in a world where ghosts, demons and witches really do exist. Once that is established its on with the show and there is no looking back whereas the X Files constantly had the viewer questioning and thinking about what he was seeing and hearing. Where The X Files was the thinking mans science paper, Supernatural is a camp fire ghost story.Which is more then fine by me. As a lover of ghost stories myself Supernatural makes for fantastic viewing. Its strongest points are its atmosphere and visual imagery. The storyline surrounding the brothers relationship to their father and to each other is in its fledgling stages and will no doubt become stronger over time. Already though it is fun to watch the interplay between Dean and Sam. being the older brother in a family of two myself I find myself sympathising with Dean. Not just because of that but also because I find his personality something I can relate to. His is very Mulder-like in his often whimsical approach to situations. The other brother Sam I find downright annoying at times with the overplayed teen angst.As for the story lines themselves this is Supernaturals weakest point. So far in the first series Supernatural has a basic structure which rarely changes - brothers drive into town, weird things (usually deaths) happen, brothers use fake ID's to find out about the demon / witch / ghost just in time to save the Hot Chick of the Week(tm) wash, rinse, repeat. If it continues Supernatural is in danger of burning out real fast. However in latter episodes there looks to be some sort of mythology developing which should hopefully complicate things. The fathers connection to their mothers death, Sams visions, the Meg demon etc.Having just criticised the story lines I have to admit I love their themes. Each week focuses on a different legend such as the woman in white, bloody mary, vampires etc. Each handled very well and with a surprising amount of knowledge. You can tell that ghost story telling is a real labour of love for the creators. It also introduces a lot of lesser known legends such as the wendigo, shrika etc. Someone is doing their homework and I cant wait to see what creatures appear in later episodes. The references to other supernatural shows such as the x files and ghostbusters is an added treat for fans of the genre. As is the classic rock soundtrack. My god someone has taste. Its like they reached into my mind and put down all my favourite past times on celluloid. Well the ones that can be viewed by under 18's anyway. I wouldn't say Supernatural has \"made scary sexy\". I would say its made scary cool again. If only I could be cool again too. Maybe I would be if I had a Chevy Impala too.All in all an excellent new series dripping with humour, atmosphere and chills.

It was action packed with two bad-ass brothers fighting no not crime, but ghosts. Spirits. The writers have done their research into urban legends and local myths, building on spooks we've grown up hearing about, sometimes beings scared of, and other's apprehensive. They give these spooks a face and then send Dean and Sam to blow them to smithereens.While the coated focus is naturally the supernatural, the deep artery of the show is the love between these brothers as they sort out their past and arguments with \"Dad\" and challenge their future with a new light. They're action packed, gun toting, hot rod driving, (not to mention sexy) heroes saving people from harmful supernatural beings, (as they're not all ghosts). The music choice of the shows is also superb with everything from Blue Oyster Cult's \"Don't fear the reaper\" to Iron Butterfyl's \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\".

Jared Padalecki, of \"Gilmore Girls,\" is a familiar face who gets a chance to toughen up his image a little. The first episode sets up some mysteries to be solved over the season but also has some immediate gratification. No spoilers here ~ you'll have to watch it yourself.

He is a veteran of this field having directed X-Files, Roswell, Dark Angel, Smallville, Disturbing Behavior, Millennium, etc. One of the producers, McG, has produced The OC, and has directed both Charlie's Angels movies. Jared and Jensen are placed in roles they are familiar with, Jared is playing Sam, a character who seems to be a tougher version of Dean, his character from the Gilmore Girls. Jensen is playing Dean, a character who is extremely close to being a human clone of his sarcastic character from Dark Angel, Alec. Opening a WB show with such great effects scores big with me- not giving anything away, the special effects are what Nutter and his team are capable of. Sarah Shahi as a guest star was icing on the cake. The only problem I see with the show is the fact that it is not geared towards the main demographic of the OC and Gilmore Girls (which airs in the time slot before Supernatural) and it may turn away a group of older viewers who may really enjoy it. As long as they don't call it the \"teen X-Files\" or \"Buffy meets Twin Peaks\" it will be fine.

The concept is manipulative, of course, but Blood of My Blood could have had promise.Could have. Unfortunately. BOMB (an interesting acronym) fails to deliver its promise on many levels. First and foremost, unlike Outlander, BOMB lacks the narrative depth so beautifully provided by Diana Gabaldon's novels. BOMB relies on echoes of Outlander while denying the audience the opportunity to experience careful and deliberate character and plot development. BOMB is rushed, plowing headlong into the series without compassion for the viewer. We are to accept what is doled out and be grateful for it.Outlander permits the suspension of belief with its originality, excitement and underlying good humor. We are willing to believe Outlander because it made us want to believe even in the face of its outlandish premise. And this made by its wonderful characterizations of the struggles and hope of Claire and Jamie, portrayed by two actors whose chemistry was electric, bolstered by Galbadon's writings. BOMB captures none of the mystery and magic of its predecessor. Characters pass through stones with alacrity failing to exhibit the traumatic intensity of what just happened to them. No big deal, it appears. Said the Writers: Let's get this whole psssing-through-stones thing over and done with. Let's just mirror Outlander, make the characters mini-me's, yes, caricatures of the originals and sprinkle in easter eggs, toss in gruff and cantankerous Scots throughout and the audience will go for it.Because, you see, BOMB is produced with a specific intent.And the result? A boring, plodding, uninspired, poorly scripted and acted series. Even if one to were regard it as a stand-alone, it's simply not very good. BOMB is a sore disappointment. Critics applaud and I'm mystified. Viewers rave and I understand. It's hard to let go of Outlander. Yet there will never be another Outlander and any attempt at replicating it's magic, no matter what STARZ hopes for, will never fully reach that pinnacle.",

It's also beautifully shot, everything from the cinematography to the costumes are excellent. The overall production value on this as good as anything on tv.

            "review": "Compared to the first two episodes of \"Outlander\", this prequel is more slow-pace. I was bored the first 30 minutes; it took a little bit longer to intrigue me. No one from the cast stands out as Hollywood's next leading star (yet). Safe to say, no one will be nabbing a bunch of solo magazine covers like Sam Heughan (Jamie Fraser). Other actors could've been casted in these roles, and I would've liked the show just the same (or maybe even more). I probably like Harriett Slater (Ellen MacKenzie) the best, so far. She's definitely a more natural actress than Sophie Skelton (Brianna).It's an ensemble cast right from the start, so no one is overworked to the bone like Caitriona Balfe (Claire) was during the first season of Outlander, as she was in almost every scene.Apparently, the word \"da\" is a Scottish slang. Yet, I thought Brianna was solely using that word because it's less formal than saying \"dad\"? After all, she barely knew Jamie and so saying \"dad\" or \"father\" was too uncomfortable. Everyone says \"da\" on this show though! Weird... that word is not exclusive to just Bri?This \"Blood of My Blood\" cast isn't as fan-friendly as the original \"Outlander\" cast, which is disappointing. Being that they're more-so newcomers, I would expect them to not be jaded yet. Since many of them (with the exception of Rory Alexander and Tony Curran whom are very nice) are already arrogant and rude towards fans, it makes it harder for me to root for them. For a few of them, maybe their handlers or PR personnel are to blame instead, but this attitude needs to change. Stop acting like you are Meryl Streep or Leonardo DiCaprio.Sex scenes are more simplified and conservative, similar to the last few seasons of Outlander so you can definitely tell intimacy coordinators are now used.The unannounced time jumps are a bit confusing, but you'll figure out what time period they're on soon enough.All four of the main characters cross paths and are somehow interconnected, which is cool. I thought the two couples would possibly not cross paths as they're on two separate time periods.I will continue watching.",

Feels completely unearned. The whole point of the first season of Outlander was the slow-burn, the romance, the chemistry. Here there is none of that.I don't really buy the relationship between the dead laird and his daughter either.The brothers are both villains, how are we supposed to root for any of that? And the sisters seem jealous, and there are very few female characters. This is not a show that will pass the Bechdel test.The main girl, a perfect Mary Sue? Charming but clearly from the 21s century\nThe main guy, a very weak copy of Jamie Fraser, makes you feel nothing\nThe other couple (Claire's parents) get given only 3' in the first episode and they are already together in the WWI scene. Guessing that their story is that they get separated and have to reunite? That part seems like just a repeat of the exact same story, the girl travels through the stones after saying \"I'll be right back\"\nThe culture / setting... It was captivating and enchanting in what I remember of Outlander. Sorry but here it just seems primitive, brutal and basic. It's all about gaining/losing power, beating people up, and who's gonna be able to sleep with girls, more or less consensually\nThe first sexual assault attempt is 25' in, the threat of it is constantly present in the dialogues, it's just pervasive. So it doesn't look like this show will be better on that front. Possibly the opposite!And wasn't the first show beautiful? This first episode just looks drab\nThe opening credits are not special eitherIf I could fast-forward as I often do, I might give this more of a chance, but here you have to decipher the dialect, so that's a no-go\nSo yeah, that's a pass!",

Hence, I personally went in to this season with no preconceived expectations & thus, I must concede - after viewing the first 3 installments - that this Netflix series has completely blown me away & ironically surpassed even my wildest dreams.Of course, I can only comment as a casual viewer (& am unable to ascertain the faithfulness to the source material, present within these episodes), but within the first 3 hours, we as an audience are introduced to a rich, layered, enchanting world of pure imagination that is creatively borne, masterfully realised & the sheer scope & scale captured from beginning to end is honestly mesmerising. Indeed, it's no surprise to witness peculiar & cerebral fantastical wonders on screen - in a fantasy constructed from the inspired mind of such a quirky, ingenious scribe - yet nonetheless, I still found myself utterly confounded by the sheer regality & majesty of this grandiose, unconventional & wholly epic tale.It's a credit to all of the cast & crew members involved, who've respectfully & lovingly brought such a breathtaking universe to life & I'm hopeful the quality established here in the preliminary chapters will continue throughout... Because from what I've seen, I'm seriously floored. It is utterly remarkable, beautifully dark & haunted & unlike anything I've had the opportunity to previously binge on the streaming service, in its history.There's a palpable sense of history & mythology to it which immediately draws you in & I cannot wait to see more.

My hopes for The Sandman were not too high after that terrible fail to adapt American Gods for screen, but even my little hope was rather drained by an at best mediocre story and production. Remember, this is my opinion on the show, as I don't know the source material, I do not know how good or bad the comics are, and how close the show is to the original story.

Tom Sturridge is Dream and does a great job carrying the show. Even his look and slender frame help make the character more believable.Also - it's really funny how many reviewers are outraged by the fact some characters are female, or black or LGBTQ. We are talking about a fantasy show. Who cares if they changed some of the characters? \"Are they telling a good story?\" Is the only question we should be asking. There are a million shows with all straight white casts. Hollywood has also notoriously whitewashed characters who weren't fictional just to appease white viewers. Where was the outrage when the blue eyed Burt Lancaster played an Apache chief or Elizabeth Taylor played Cleopatra? Remember when Angelina Jolie played Mariane Pearl who is a Afro-Cuban women in real life. Jake Gyllenhaal played the Prince of Persia. Liam Neeson played Ra's al Ghul in Batman. Tilda Swinton played The Ancient One in Doctor Strange. The list goes on and on and on... I'm sorry if it makes you feel uncomfortable when you see diversity in a show.

Lost did it really well in the beginning but then became a tool of convenience.

Charlie Brooker has popped out of the internet at times when I least expect it revealing the more unsettling aspects of our culture through his program Screenwipe and others. That was my first exposure to Doug Stanhope, a comedian who among others brings us closer together via demonstrations of how media and technology are changing our society and rarely for the better. Black Mirror arrives in the form of anthologized science fiction in the vein of the Twilight zone. It is a series that examines our society's relationship with the media and how it allows us to both shape our own identity and imprison us in a space where empathy and truth are weaknesses and something to hide in order to get ahead.I have always been interested in futurists and Brooker seems to fill the requirements for one. There is nothing in the first two installments that do not reflect current trends in our collective behavior but instead extrapolates where current trends in communications technology; avatars, social media and reality television might lead us if we do not seek to preserve what is beautiful and pure about our collective consciousness and humanity.Having seen reviews here that feel there is no commentary embedded within these stories I couldn't disagree more. As the title suggests, Brooker's Black Mirror shows us a dark reflection of our selves and allows us to evaluate these scenarios through our own emotional filters.There are no blatant soap box messages but I interpreted the narratives as cautionary tales and would hope that no one, when confronted with them, would hope for these near futures. The only thing holding them back from becoming reality is our own resistance to complacency and purely spectator culture.Beyond these philosophical aspects, the program is incredibly well produced and executed in my opinion. The characters and sets create convincing realities and I was never once drawn out of the story due to poor acting, scripting or characterizations. I could not recommend this series more and hope that it will continue on. Congratulations to Brooker and company for their work and their apparent concern for all of us.",

Every episode is unique yet criticizes the same absurd society we're living in. I was shocked at the great filming/acting/directing and of course writing of these different stories. My personal favorite would be episode 2. The most futuristic but also the most accurate representation of what most of our lives look like right now. Just saw in a review that a guy stopped watching after 20 minutes at the second episode. That's the biggest mistake he could do. Definitely the best episode. I wont miss anything else Charlie Brooker does and i'm patiently waiting for the DVD to come out. I hope this also gets a Blu-Ray version and maybe some new episodes after wards?",

The one thing that never seems to change is us. Technology evolves, mutates, advances and declines, but human beings, our feelings, our courage, fears, and desires remain within us.I love this show.

            "review": "Amazing British anthology series with a very intriguing concept. The premise: taking contemporary phenomena (ranging from the wild popularity of talent shows on TV to the impact of social media and smartphones on our lives) as a starting point and speculate how such phenomena could/would evolve in the future. Each episode tells a different story with different protagonists and focuses on a different theme. Of course, the series doesn't explore the beneficial aspects or any positive trends - (where would the fun be in that?) - but clearly approaches its topics from a pessimistic, cynical point of view (hence the title). As the show's creator Charlie Brooker ('Dead Set') puts it: \"...They (the different stories) are all about the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy.\"The resulting mix of bleak sci-fi, drama, satire and black comedy makes for highly intelligent Television and ranks among the most original and entertaining shows I've ever come across. The writing and directing are excellent and the cast includes such talented thesps as Domhnall Gleeson, Rory Kinnear, Toby Kebbell, Hayley Atwell, Jon Hamm, Jason Flemyng and Rupert Everett - to name but a few. Unique, fascinating and highly recommended. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

Horrified that someone would conceive and execute such a vile, disgusting piece of television such as this. Instead of fantasy, charm, literacy, and magic, we get an absolutely disgusting piece of rubbish. Rod Serling is turning over in his grave after this garbage was likened to TZ by Netflix.

The first interpretation is that the show looks inwards, at the darker aspects of humanity and society. This is done through the theme of technology, hence the second meaning. The black mirror is the screen that rules our lives.Each self-contained episode is brilliantly crafted and produced. The stories are compelling and the acting is phenomenal. This show is not for those looking exclusively for entertainment, as the episodes leave you with a distinctly empty feeling. Although this is obviously the intent, one cannot help but wonder at the creators' bleak outlook on the world. The presence of bestiality in the first episode could very well deter some viewers, but I would remind them that the show is Twilight Zone-esque in structure as well as theme. The episodes may be watched in any order, as they are all completely independent of one another. The second episode in particular is storytelling of the highest form.Black Mirror is disturbing in the best possible way. It unflinchingly explores the issues of society through deeply intimate stories and characters and their interactions with technology. Let me be clear, it will not leave you feeling fulfilled. Watching it was an exhausting experience that shook me deeply. The thought provoking subject matter combine with powerful, desolate stories and excellent performances to create one of the most unique and brilliant shows that I have seen. It not only holds the viewer's attention while it plays, it enthralls your thoughts long after the credits roll.",

To say that this show deals with the dark side of technology and human nature is to make to simple of a comparison. The stories are mostly set in a dystopian world that is dominated or badly influenced by modern technology. What makes \"Black mirror\" so great is the attention to detail and inter/intrapersonal relationships and how the main character would feel and experience its brave new world.\nWell thought out plots, characters, settings and really good storytelling. It asks some hard questions of what and where we really want technology to take us. Or maybe already have taken us. Definitely worth seeing! Treat yourself and watch this. 9/10",

I don't think Black Mirror will appeal to everyone because some themes are a slightly uncomfortable especially in the pilot episode. So far the actors that have been cast have done an amazing job, and the writers have managed to make some far fetched ideas seem graspable. Basically this series is unlike anything else on TV and for that it gets a big thumbs up from me.I don't want to write any spoilers, but what I will say is this if you want a drama with dark twist or a series that is completely Original make it Black Mirror.",

For me the high water marks were CROCODILE, METALHEAD and WHITE BEAR. Though I have to say, I still got back and watch the speech from 15 MILLION MERITS for the thrill of it.

Be prepared to care only about Attack on Titan and nothing else, because nothing else will make you feel this way.",

And now, having watched the third season I don't understand, why it isn't rated even higher!Truly a masterpiece, and deserves to be mentioned on the same page as other fantasy war epics like Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones. (I dare to say this is even better than those two.) There are countless twist and turns, shocking revelations and heartbreaking moments troughout the series, spiced with great voice acting, beautiful visuals and on top of all: a more than perfect, stunning soundtrack, thanks to Hiroyuki Sawano.The story is brilliantly written, and does not slow down, not even for a bit. It keeps growing bigger and bigger, while you will find yourself tied to your chair, as you can't watch only one or two episodes. Behind the plot and the action, there is also deeper meaning about war, humanity and questions about moral dilemmas.Toughtprovoking, exciting and most of all a masterpiece of our time!",

            "review": "Attack On Titan is officially over. And nothing will ever be the same.When I finished Breaking Bad back in 2019 prior to ever watching anime, if someone told me an anime would be on the same playing field as Breaking Bad and even exceed it at times, I would've told them they were crazy. But in reality, I was the crazy one. This story took me places mentally and emotionally I didn't think I could go.In this dark and cruel world created by Hajime Isayama, while some things are objectively wrong, there's never a moment where you can definitively say that someone's the good guy or bad guy. Once you see the full picture of the show, it's indescribable to explain the show in the manner of good and bad considering how much everyone's in this dark abyss of a gray area that has no objective answer to whom is in the right or wrong. And that's the beauty of AOT.Attack On Titan is not meant to be joyous. It's a tragedy. It's an unfair world where everyone at some point is given a dirty hand whether they deserve it or not, and the characters have to try and live with that reality and keep moving forward. Now that doesn't mean that there aren't moments where you as a viewer can feel joyous for your perspective favorite character/side because there likely will be, but when you're no longer told the story through this small microscope, you won't be able to see the show the same.And that's where the absurd genius of the creator Hajime Isayama comes into play. As much as I love the Vince Gilligan's of the world, David Chase, Peter Gould, Jesse Armstrong, David Simon and honestly any writer of any piece of fiction... no one comes close to the creativity that this man has. Isayama is able to create this large world in these small walls surrounded by humanoid creatures that live to destroy and ruin the human race. But as you continue to watch the show, it's like you're peeling an endless onion that doesn't stop, and constantly makes your eyes water and tear up due to the brutality and the absurdity that this universe subjects you to. It will boggle your mind then tear you to shreds in ways that I've never seen before.The plot twists are second to none. The heartbreak will shatter you to pieces. The betrayals will leave you speechless. The world building will make everything before seem small. And the clashes of different ideals will leave you wondering how you could even pick a side. I could go on all day but to put it simply, the unique story in itself is what brings this all together. And that's not even mentioning things like the voice acting, music, animation, esc. Which are all top tier.This isn't an anime. This isn't a TV show. This is a fictional masterpiece. And I'm honored and blessed to say that I got to live to see the day where I'd witness the end of it. Thank you, Hajime Isayama. And see you later, AOT.",

            "review": "Review By Kamal KStory 10/10It continunes few days after where we left off last season and it focuses more on political drama and dilemmas inside the walls. This season gets straight to the point and introduces new villain named Kenny that turns out to be somehow related to Levi. There are many parties trying to get Eren and Historia. For what reason? It is yet to be reveald. Mystery we all feel in love with is still there and there are even more questions, but don't let that distract you from the fact that this season ,even tho is only few episodes in, already has some major reveals in it. Pacing is amazing and i wasn't bored for a moment while watching. Things are only getting more interesting when Erwin reveals how he's planning to ovethrow the governmant without using the force. This season has a very refreshing and different plot compared to previous ones as we can see from the lack of titans and focuse on the issues inside the walls rather than beyond. However it's still as, if not more interesting than before. There is world buidling,mystery,back stabbing and some major questions answered which there is hopfully more to come.Animation 10/10As we can see characters in this season look a little bit different or older which some might not like but i do personally. It's a fresh change. They look closer to their manga designes. Some might notice that they removed those thick black lines around characters faces which made AOT art stand out even more. Don't get me wrong, it still does but that was something that was missing which kept me from giving it 10/10.\nAnimation is brilliant for this season (it's Attack on Titan after all :D) and like every season it only got better. . Perfect combination between 3D background and 2D animation along with masterfull camera movement made this scene look like a movie. There is even one frame where levi is facing the wall and you can see his reflection in the window. Just goes to show how much detail and time was put in to this scene. After i done some research i found out that it took the animator of this scene 1 whole month to complete it. Just that one scene alone. All props to Arifumi Imai. Great job. Hopfully it keeps this quality because this season is said to be 24 episodes long.Sound 10/10I mean, is there anything to say? AoT is notorious for it's amazing OST and sound quality. Voice actors are great as always and the sound that stand out to me the most was the sound of falling shell from kenny on the roof in ep.1. It was just so satisfying :D. And again mad props to Hiroyuki Sawano (the composer) for the epic and emotional music.Characters 10/10What i like about AoT characters is the fact that they interact so naturally and nothing from their conversation seems forced which is immediately showcased in the very first scene in ep. 1. That cabin scene where jean and eren argue,sasha tries to steal bread, mikasa still does work even tho she's injured and armin cares for her deeply. And of course Levi the clean freak comes in at the end :p They are such fun and lively characters.\nThis season already had some major development for our cast. We got to see Erwin's and Hisotira's backstories which also delved deeper in their characters motives. Both backstories were heartbreaking and made me care a lot more for them. Hisotira is slowly taking of her \"Christa Lenz\" facade (is that how you say it? lol) and Erwin is proving again and again why everyone loves him and would follow him to death. His childhood story is very similar to how our society and governmant wokrs today which is very scary. And we all need to remember that isayama is criticizing this type of government and society with these topics. Instead of just walking of Erwin comes back to Dimo Rivees's wife and comforts her saying he'll avange him. Erwin is charismatic,great leader, intellignet and someone that you just want to follow. Since the young age he was corious and as he call himself a \"gambler\". He is someone that would give everything for the humanity. Or is he? I think there is a lot more to his character. Hange got some development too. Eren is maturing and seems a lot more chill this season but unfortunately he is kiddnaped again :( Poor guy he just can't catch a break. In ep.1 he helps historia to overcome here pain and shows again just how honest he is by telling her \"I like you more this way, just a stupidly normal honest girl\". Also hugeee development for armin. To think that he would be capable of killing a human.. this will deffinitely have a huge impact on his character in the future. The way he selfreflects and his philosohpical speach about morals is great, it really makes you think. He kinda has a point too. He shows one more time how mentally strong he is even tho he lacks physicial strength. This time is just on another level. Now lets talk about our new villain. KENYYYYYYYYYYY. I love this guy lol. The way he roasts and insults levi and the cowboy vibe he gives. I love it. He immediately showcases that he is not a joke by blowing nifa's head off just like that. He also seems very mysterious. The way he treats levi is almost as if he looks down upon him. Speaking of Levi here is what i think: That chase scene where he's running away from kenny is not just a great action sequence it also represents Levi running from his past. Kenny=His past. Running from kenny or his past. This arc is also big development and challange for him now that he has to act as a leader/commander because erwin is absent or busy. There was also some smaller developments for connie (motivating himself to take on the beast titan),jean (struggling to remain human which almost costs him life, also selfreflecting), sanes (showing how he didn't want to do the things that he has done and over the time he just got used to it, also he was kinda easy to symphatise with too and his devotion to king is may be morally wrong but aslo admirable, the way he feels destroyed after finding out that he was actually the one that betrayed the king is also worth mentioning), flegel (stepping up becoming a boss saying how he'll protect the people of his city), zachary (showcasing that he cares more about himself rather than humanity and how he always hated the governmant because they looked up on everyone).Enjoyment 10/10I never enjoyed AoT more. It's great.This season has perfect balance between story telling, character development and action.Overall 10/10",

One of the best so far. As it has only 9 episodes as of now ... many critics say that it is way too early to rate an anime. But, according to me, this is pure class. The soundtrack's tempo varies according to the situation and this makes it more exciting. The ending of the episode is something that NO one will look forward to as NO one will want it to end. A must watch for every anime lover and of course the manga is available as well. Although a bit gory, the epicness makes up for it!

The first couple of episodes of season 4 part 1 were actually good, but after that the anime started to feel like a typical cliché fantasy anime with its typical bland plot.

Then season 3! A literal masterpiece... specially the second arc. and the 4th season is expected to be God Level. And I expect nothing less from the greatest anime of all time. That's how good the story is! It's complex yes. Greatest Plot I have ever seen on a show. I love breaking bad, I love Avatar the last air-bender, I love Game of thrones. But The story line, music, and the voice acting are all 10/10 easily. Do yourself a favor, don't judge it by it's cover, get through some quality anime till you reach God level story telling.

It's exciting, it's mysterious, and it does a fantastic job of setting the tone.Season 2: 6/10This season is fine, it strays from the first season's tone a bit more than I'd like and it's full of conversations between major characters that the audience has zero context for, making this is a frustrating season to watch. On top of that, what should've been one of the show's biggest reveals is extremely downplayed to the detriment of the season.Season 3: 5/10I'm very mixed about this season. It's divided into two distinct arcs, the first of which is awful and the second of which is nearly the same level of quality as the first season. The structure and pacing of the first arc is terrible, the villains are bland and either not fleshed out at all or too late for the audience to care. The second arc of this season, however, is exciting and much more important to the overall narrative of the show. It still fails to perfectly recapture the tone of season one, but it's very good. The first arc is a 3/10 and the second if a 7/10, so rating-wise I took the average.Season 4: 6/10This season was difficult to get through for me, not because it was bad but because it was so different, There was so much information, and there were so many new characters and conflicts. It was a lot, but I think in the end it mostly worked. Not every new character or plot thread mattered in the grand scheme of things, while others mattered a lot and significantly impacted the narrative. The animation style was also very different this season and unfortunately it was to the show's detriment.Overall, I like this show a lot, but it has some significant problems. My biggest complaint was that the tone was set perfectly in season one, then largely abandoned for the rest of the series. Despite this, the show is exciting, the music and animation is (mostly) great, and the characters are well-realized and fun to watch.",

But now, with only 1 episode left, i can finally write whats in my heart.In AOT, you dont have to support the \"good\" against the \"evil\", because simply there's no such thing in this world. Usually, an any work whether if its a movie, tv show or an anime, there's sides and you as a viewer have the choice to support whatever you like good or bad. Most people choose the good side, some choose the bad one. This type of work represents almost 75% of all the works out there. So some of us have adjusted to the idea of good and bad sides.The other 25% are shows, movies and animes like AOT, they are psychologically complexed with a lot of twists and most importantly no good or bad sides. These kind of animes describes the world and our reality in such a scary truthful way, it mixes your emotions and feelings and you dont know what to think, makes you consider a thousand time before calling a character good or bad, this is AOT.After completing most of the show i can say, that AOT reached a high level of realism. That you dont have to determine in which side are you.One advice for anyone who hasn't saw AOT or is still in the beginning, dont take sides, just enjoy the anime because I believe its the best anime in the world.",

Shingeki No Kyojin has one of the best character developments and plot in history (note that this series does not have fill), he even the secondary and third characters have a great importance in the story, but also has that sense of terror, action and drama that by the way is incredibly well done, makes you live the situation that the characters go through and transmit their emotions to you in a very human way. It has an excellent background story that is simply memorable.Every decision they make is of minor importance to the series and should not be missed, their deaths and the surprise of knowing who are the real antagonists add a magical touchThe first season has a slight start, it ends up being a spectacular season, it is not the best but it is an amazing season with an incredible animation and plot, here you will be introduced to the first antagonist of the series. 9.4/10The second season I think was epic, this is when you start to see the faces of the real villains (get ready for Senshi Tmp 2 Ep 6 which according to me is the best of the second season, an overwhelming chapter) Shingeki no Kyojin explains it to you perfectly without leaving gaps in the plot, an incredible season. 9.6/10The third season is truly phenomenal, has a good start and lets you know the problems you will have in a society by not agreeing with something or the difficult decisions you must make to ensure your survival. After this, too many things are clarified without detours, the chapters that stood out most were Perfect Game (Tmp 3, Ep 16), Hero (Tmp 3, Ep 17), Midnight Sun (Tmp 3, Ep 18) and That Day (Tmp 3, Ep 20) (That day has no action or features our main characters, but this chapter amazes me, its development is spectacular and the way they explain everything is overwhelming, honestly, the best development chapter in the history of anime). 9.8/10Season four is the start of the finale. A season practically perfect, in this season everything comes to light answering every question of the viewer, leaves no gaps in the plot and has a beautiful animation, besides that is incredibly shocking and demonstrates the incredible development in our protagonists, Eren has the best character development I think. For me the best chapters were in my opinion Declaration of War (Tmp 4, Ep 5) (Declaration of War is one of the most impactful chapters of development), The War Hammer Titan (Tmp 4, Ep 6), Assault (Tmp 4, Ep 7), Assassin's Bullet (Tmp 4, Ep 7) (Assassin's Bullet left me speechless...) and Above and Below (Tmp 4, Ep 16), has not yet finished this season, but still for me it is spectacular. 9.9/ 10 This season is the best.In my opinion your average would be 9.3/10.

The first 6 or 7 episodes were compelling but then something happened, as though the director suddenly chickened out. Later victims and Dahmer's experiments with injecting his victims in the brain to create a zombie he could control, were completely ignored. A relationship with one of his victims was invented and an occupant of his apartment block was invented. Then suddenly and for no apparent reason, the whole story stopped being about a serial killer and became all about civil rights with it being suggested that Dahmer's motivation was racist. Dahmer was many things but he was an equal opportunities killer. He chose victims because he found them beautiful and the colour of that person was not his concern. I don't understand why the series suddenly went down this cul-de-sac.

Beginning development in 2020, the miniseries is the fourth dramatic take on the infamous serial killer following three independent productions, 1992's The Secret Life, 2002's Dahmer, and 2017's My Friend Dahmer receiving very degrees of responses with My Friend Dahmer arguably the best of the three. When the miniseries was first announced I was skeptical because I didn't think there was any more to be told about Dahmer than we'd already learned from years of rubbernecking let alone three film attempts, but much to my surprise I found this miniseries to not only exceed my expectations, but shattered them as Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is one of the year's best TV shows and if you end up seeing only one Dahmer related piece of media in your life, make it this one.While the show may be titled after serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, he's only half of what this movie is about. While the first 3 or four episodes dive extensively into Dahmer's childhood from age six where he first began to manifest his macabre interest in dead animals and dissecting them through his teens and 20s where we see the effects of Dahmer's unstable homelife, repressed homosexuality, and darkening appetites, the movie places more focus on the lead-up to Dahmer's actions as well as the fallout that came after the horrifying revelations came to light (and not just with Dahmer himself). Intermixed with the scenes of Dahmer socially engineering his victims, struggling with keeping his compulsions in check, or failure to maintain professional and personal relationships, we're shown a series of failures either through incompetence, apathy, distraction or neglect that disregard the obvious warning signs surrounding Dahmer as he deals with barely concealed issues that are missed by parents, educators, law enforcement, or administrative officials with those who actually try to shine a light on Dahmer's actions ignored at best or punished or threatened with punishment at worst. This is a show that despite being set in the early 90s is no less prescient today with issues such as systemic racism and homophobia still very much allowing inaction or harm to victims, and an award ceremony scene where two police officers are rewarded for simply avoiding responsibility for handing a child over to Dahmer will make your blood boil with how little has changed in regards to the \"blue wall of silence\" and the corruption of police unions in keeping unfit officers out of the profession.The acting is solid across the board. Evan Peters is really good is the titular Dahmer as he captures the tragedy of his situation in the early years, but Peters and the creative team don't try to use this as an excuse or easy answer (an epilogue says as much there's no simple answer) and Dahmer's metamorphosis from struggling confused adolescent to cold calculating opportunistic predator who justifies his actions with a false victimhood complex makes it clear that Dahmer's actions have no \"out\" from his responsibility for them. The movie is an ensemble and features a number of characters either recurring or one off who are integral to the plot. Easily my favorite comes in the form of deaf actor Rodney Burford who plays Dahmer's victim Tony Hughes and the entire episode is anchored to the POV of this character with characters using ASL to communicate, muffling the audio to create verisimilitude, and you feel like you get to know Hughes in a way we've never been allowed to see before. Make no mistake, this is a starmaking performance from Burford so expect to see much more of him in the future, I guarantee it. The show also features terrific performances from arguably the two \"cores\" of this movie, Niecy Nash as Dahmer's neighbor and until now unsung hero of this story Glenda Cleveland, and veteran character actor Richard Jenkins as Dahmer's torn and conflicted father Lionel.With Nash's Glenda, we get the feeling of powerlessness and helplessness from the people on the ground affected by Dahmer's actions as noted in the movie that Dahmer lived in a cheap rundown part of Milwaukee and targeted mostly people of color as his victims. While Glenda reports the awful smells coming from Dahmer's apartment to the landlord as well as sounds of screening of fighting to the police, not only is she often ignored, but is shouted down by the police such as the infamous incident wherein officers John balcerzak and Joseph Gabrish took Dahmer's word that 14 year-old Konerak Sinthasomphone was actually his drunk 19 year old boyfriend instead of his victim who'd been given an amateur lobotomy by Dahmer instead of an escaped victim despite Glenda's pleas. The movie isn't excessively gory as the gore is limited to only plot important scenes, but just because it's not as bloody as Saw or Hostel doesn't make it easier to watch and in some cases it's actually harder. Richard Jenkins is really strong as Dahmer's father Lionel and the different points of the story that portray him as wanting to help his son but not knowing how are heartbreaking because you see in Lionel the confusion and discomfort that make him unable to give Dahmer the help he needs because he very much denies there even is a problem and tries to write it off as something that can be cured with tough love or firm guidance. There isn't any singular point of blame you can link to Dahmer (as the show isn't about \"understanding Dahmer\"), but the show does give us some potential issues such as a mentally unstable mother, a distant father, and internalized feelings of abandonment, but even then these aren't frame as excuses. The show stays good even after the actual crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer are over and done with by the halfway point, as the show shifts focus away from Dahmer and looks at the media fallout, the insane fandom surrounding Dahmer, the exploitation of tabloids and indie comics that trivialize Dahmer and his victims, and to watch these victims and their families be at the mercy of harassing phone calls and invasive pictures by rubbernecking tourists is painful to watch.If I haven't made it clear, Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is one of the best TV projects I've seen this year and I can't recommend it enough. My one point of criticism is I felt certain tangents related to Ed Gein and John Wayne Gacy seemed a little out of place and I wasn't sure why they were presented the way they were with such polished detailed flashbacks, but other than that one misstep I really think everyone should see this show.",

            "review": "My initial rating based on episode 1 was a 9; but now that I've seen them all my opinion has changed significantly.If I had to rate the show itself, at least my by IMDb show standards, it would be somewhere between a 7 and 8. The only good reason to watch this is to see Richard Jenkins' performance as Dahmer's father, because it's some incredible acting.The show itself is so... confused. It doesn't seem to know what it wants to do. On one hand it's trying to appeal to true crime fans that want to watch and hear about the most lurid and disgusting stuff imaginable. It wants to be a show about the philosophical implications of a person like Dahmer even existing. It wants to talk about the psychological conditions that bring about people like him. And it wants to do some social commentary about the police, racial issues.As you can imagine, it does none of this, because it doesn't have a focus. So what you've got is the first half that just feels like a personal story of Dahmer's, and the second which is like some boring, cliched drama about the families and the fallout of what's happened.As other reviews were asking, what is the purpose of this story? Was it to cover Dahmer? That's been done before, and it's not like it appeals to such a huge audience. Was it to explore philosophical questions of good and evil or maybe talk about policing issues in some places? Probably way better cases you could work with if that's your intent.The reason I'm giving it a 5 rather than a 7 is because the moral messages this show conveys aren't just twisted, they're also hypocritical. It celebrates Dahmer's death at the hand of some lunatic as if that's some great deed. It tries to say that it's a bad thing that some stupid comic featuring Dahmer wasn't banned, even as this show VERY GRATUITOUSLY depicts the killing of his real victims. Like, what?... It's pretending to be this respectful quasi-documentary that's imparting valuable lessons when it's anything but. It's damning what a hubristic view these creators have of themselves.Should you watch this? Not really. Any scenes worth your time will probably be on Youtube, and the whole package is not worth the 10h investment. There's nothing to learn here and nothing to gain.",

            "review": "For those interested in the psychology of a serial killer, there is no more fascinating character study than Jeffrey Dahmer. He was a psychiatric enigma and a profoundly sick individual. A chronic alcoholic from a very young age. A sexual deviant with all manner of unusual fetishes. A necrophiliac. A cannibal.A pure psychopath and the product of a perfect storm of schizotypal/borderline personality disorder, developmental toxicity (exposure to psychoactive drugs in utero), negative parental influence, neglect and childhood trauma, a morbid curiosity with the macabre, social exclusion at school and deep feelings of loneliness, sexual confusion and insecurity.He longed to be cared about and loved by his family. He longed to be accepted by his peers. But, at the same time, knew deep down that he would inevitably disappoint his parents because of his inability to live a normal life and that he wouldn't be accepted by friends due to his odd personality.We all tend to seek out like-minded people and make connections with those we have something in common with. The problem was that Jeffrey knew there wasn't anybody out there with the same interests or outlook as him. Left to his own devices by absent parents and socially isolated, he became increasingly withdrawn and followed a path of introversion and solitude.He must have felt like he didn't belong in this world, and that there wasn't a place for him within society, so he abandoned all attempts to participate and pursued a voyeuristic way of life. He lacked a clear or positive self-image, meaning his perspective of other people was skewed, which resulted in him fully embracing his warped perception of pleasure and satisfaction. The men he felt attracted to were purely sex objects to him; walking, talking sex dolls. His interest was solely in their aesthetic, or physical appearance.He appeared to have been a deeply troubled soul from the outset and his behaviours were predominantly a consequence of his genetic constitution, exacerbated by negative life experiences. If his childhood had been a more positive one then he may have been able to adapt better to his personal limitations and dysfunctions, but there is no way of knowing the extent of the damage his upbringing had on him.It was evident from his own admissions that he felt predestined to live a peculiar and unorthodox lifestyle due to his innately bizarre persona. The conventional joys of life simply didn't float Jeffrey's boat.I rarely, if ever, feel sorry for multiple murderers, especially ones who commit such heinous and sickening crimes as Dahmer. But I have to admit that I found his story to be tragically sad.My usual take away from accounts of serial killers is wondering how and why someone could do that to another human being over and over again!? In Dahmer's case, I am left feeling conflicted with a strange understanding of, and empathy for, his actions. Of course I'm not condoning what he did, but I can appreciate how and why the sequence of events transpired.In his televised interviews he was so open, frank and forthcoming which is exceptionally rare for someone in his situation. He came across as a gentle, thoughtful and articulate person who was genuinely tormented by his inner demons throughout his life. He freely admitted to his crimes in detail, demonstrated that he knew what he had done was evil and offered honest explanations for his actions. He wanted to pay the ultimate price for his sins, resisting advice to make a plea of insanity, and took personal responsibility for the choices he made.The good part of him wanted to change and stop what the bad part had started, but he required external intervention to do so. The urges and compulsions that controlled him became an obsession and his psychosis led him down a progressively irreversible path that was impossible to resist. The dark side had an unrelenting grip on him.My personal opinion is that he was clinically insane, due to a combination of psychiatric disorders, but at the same time I feel a legal judgement of insanity would have been an insult to the families of Dahmer's victims and an inadequate penalty for such a fiendish series of killings.If you listen to him describe how he felt during his childhood and adolescence, it's clear that he should have been under the watchful eye of mental health professionals from an early age. His mother was so wrapped up in her own mental illness and his father preoccupied by work that he didn't receive the emotional support, medication and therapy he desperately needed. This was inexcusable given that both parents were acutely aware of their own emotional problems and the likelihood that these had been passed onto their son.I can't help but feel pity for Dahmer, and also that the casualties of his maniacal way of life were preventable.Between his mid-teens and early twenties he was basically a \"walking cry for help\" but nobody seemed to pay attention, try to understand him or find out what was wrong. In any case, because of the appalling and unspeakable nature of Dahmer's fantasies, it's unlikely that he would have felt able to share them with anyone, even those in a medical capacity. This would've made him feel trapped and that he might as well turn his fantasies into a reality because there was nobody to confide in and no way out of his spiralling mental condition. Like a lost cause.I mean here was a guy who felt completely alone in the world. A total and utter misfit. So reckless and uncaring about what other people thought of him, making absolutely no attempts whatsoever to conform to social norms. A loner without even a rudimentary inclination or understanding of how to make friends, relate to others or find a romantic partner. He didn't seem to know what to look for or what he wanted in a partner. His perverted version of attachment and sexual arousal didn't allow him to.I suppose all he had experienced was watching his parents at constant loggerheads and in a loveless marriage. This would have left him detached, emotionally stunted and unaware of how to express love and affection. I suspect realising that you're homosexual is a troubling and confusing time for anyone. But for someone like Dahmer, who was mentally unhinged and devoid of emotional support, it was a major dilemma and yet another psychological obstacle to contend with.He was given such an unstable start to life by bickering, neglectful parents who appeared to be unwilling to put their children's welfare first. This obviously had a massively detrimental impact on his self-esteem and sense of security, leading to an intense fear of abandonment. Hence his preference for duping his victims into spending time with him and then incapacitating them so he could enjoy their company without that fear of rejection. That way he could exercise total control over their lifeless bodies and indulge in his fetishes to his heart's content without contest.I expect he sank to unimaginable depths of depravity during those private moments, searching for the unachievable, ever-fleeting sense of fulfilment and satisfaction that he desperately wished to hold on to and savour.I've read quite a lot about Dahmer online, watched a number of interviews and the brilliant film 'My Friend Dahmer'. Evan Peters portrays him with a seemingly effortless and convincing performance that is heavily nuanced and intensely creepy. He absolutely nails the flat affect, monotone voice and distinct lack of emotional expression typical of most psychopaths.He really conveys the emptiness Dahmer had in his soul; the numbness, subdued anger and sexual frustration which engulfed him. He truly embodies Dahmer and was perfectly cast in this role.Technically speaking this series is very well researched, skilfully put together and held my undivided attention throughout. The acting by the whole cast, especially Richard Jenkins as Lionel, is first class. The tone is pitched perfectly for such a grim and sordid story. The directors create numerous moments of highly suspenseful and tense drama including some horrifying, darkly-intimate and cringe-inducing scenes, but these are needed to tell the story of Dahmer's debauchery in full.Episode 6 \"Silenced\" in particular is an exceptional and highly original piece of screenwriting with some of the most absorbing television I've seen for a long time. It was like a mini-masterpiece of melodrama.I really feel the writers got inside the mind of Dahmer, not only giving us the facts of what happened but allowing us to feel what it was like to see things the way he did. There are a number of minor adjustments or expansions to the narrative, but equally some omissions in order to make the content more palatable for the viewer. None of this affects the credibility of the series in my opinion as we are given ample opportunity to form a mental image of what happened from the point of view of all parties concerned.Despite having read up on the subject matter beforehand, and knowing how the events of his life unfolded, this excellent series has a real edginess and provides a fresh, unflinching and comprehensive account of the disturbing life of Jeffrey Dahmer.If like me you're fascinated by how a monster like Dahmer is formed, you're in for a real treat.",

This is when the story began to move away from Dahmer and his actions somewhat, and began to concentrate on other aspects of the case and the people who surrounded him. This disconnect just grew and grew into the ensuing episodes, with Dahmer being present, less and less. While some viewers may not have minded this, and perhaps viewed it as being 'thorough', to me, it was fluff and fill. There's is no convincing me that this series would not have benefitted from being two episodes shorter. In fact, you could turn it off at episode 6, and could truthfully say you saw it in its entirety, ...or at least all its best parts.",

For some reason the directors thought having the actors gaze off into the distance carries more weight - it doesn't.

He starts out a droning freak and winds up the same way... As for his accent, it seems unnatural and put-on... performed...Meanwhile the pace doesn't flow; it's a real slog to get through.... There are so many interesting aspects of Dahmer's life to be studied, to experience, and yet the entire thing feels like it's deliberately slow-motion-arthouse-weird for the sake of style instead of substance...Through school, through the army, through gay bar hookups, through everything in Dahmer's entire life including interrogation, he's a one-dimensional cardboard-cutout of how a novice acting student would IMAGINE a crazy person to be...And many good reviews are noting how off-putting and creepy this is, but... if everything's off-putting, what's there to compare it with? In fact, most of the other characters, from his victims to bosses to the police and especially Richard Jenkins as his dad, are equally as stone-faced and drowsy...Overall, MONSTER is more like another chapter of American Horror Story instead of an actual serial killer biopic... and those can be amazing, but Ryan Murphy and his boy are too stuck in their usual pretentious rut to let an actual story (of an actual person) shine through.",

He came across as an unassuming nice regular Joe schmo. Maybe it's the writing and direction's fault but there are tons of interviews and trial footage to create from so why make up completely inaccurate scenes that discredit the victims true experience? It does a major disservice to the poor victims. I don't like that, especially considering the situation involving the 14 year old boy (character assassination) ALSO.: (The moment with the cops is almost accurate, but should have been handled differently). The Niecy Nash character didn't even live in the same building as him!

Have Netflix really sunk that low?It would be different if it was an informative documentary, something like a collection of interviews with criminal psychologists, police, and victim's family members if they were willing, don't glorify him in any way, but just talk about what he did and try to explain why he did these things, maybe something positive could come out of that because people could learn how these monsters are created and we could all try to make sure that stuff doesn't happen again, but this is just cheap heat, it shocks people (and it should) but that is not automatically a good thing.If they really wanted to make something like this then they should have made it about Jack the Ripper or other cases like that, because it happened so long ago that everyone involved has been dead for a very long time.

It was like they got tired and dropped the ball. Watch all the interviews of Dahmer on YouTube and you'll see how they depicted him in prison in the series is nothing like how he really was then. They kept trying to portray him as evil and sleazy even though he was not and was repentant (he was found not to be a psychopath when tested, and even his doctors were genuinely sad to hear of his passing). As a psychology student, Dahmer has always fascinated me for the uniqueness of his psychology and how he wasn't truly evil like other serial killers, just incredibly sick.The thing that made me want to turn the show off was how they just had to stick in the rumor of Jeff taunting prisoners with food. That is completely untrue, it was a statement made by Scarver (his killer) when he was trying to get a book deal. Originally Scarver had said God told him to kill those inmates, and he also killed someone else at the same time. It had nothing to do with taunting. Also, according to Patrick Kennedy, Jeffrey had been in isolation for his own protection the entirety of his sentence until he finally asked to be released into general population even though he said he knew he would probably be killed there. And at least one officer who worked at the prison said Jeffrey was a model inmate on his way to medium security for good behavior. Inaccuracies like this are predictable but irritating.

Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly.As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the \"normal\", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future.My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

            "review": "When i first heard about the show , i thought to myself that with a premise and cast like that , what could go wrong with this show? Well there could have been a lot of things. For example the plot may have been overdone or under thought , direction may have been all over the place , but the first episode proved that it was not to be so.The plot looks delicious...yes it does and the neat direction just purely compliments the smooth design of the show. Even though story telling is non linear at times , but it has been managed very well with subtle dialogue and the growing suspense. It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.The casting is clever...very clever. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are brilliant actors and at the same time have a certain mystery about them that is Perfect for the show. They have a firm grip of their respective characters and seem dissolved in them.This show is NOT just a regular cop drama or a clichéd murder mystery. It is much much more and has already proved so in the first episode. Much is expected from it and the future looks bright for True Detective.UPDATE ( Episode 2-6 ) - Now 6 episodes have gone by and i believe my views have changed a little. The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes. From the 4th episode is when the show actually picked even more momentum and proved its worth as possibly the greatest thing on television at the moment. McConaughey is truly having the golden period of his career. The future (probable) Academy Award winner (For DBC) is at his freaking best as Rust Cohle. Harrelson is brilliant as the angry and flawed Marty Hart. I liked this show. But now i am addicted to it.With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.So far, an obvious 10/10.Final update: ( Episode 7 & 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless. Am gonna miss it.10/10",

He does crazy better than crazy people. And he usually steals any scene not nailed down.But Matthew McConaughey operates at such a level here -- not to mention the astonishing makeup which makes him appear to be playing his own father -- that he walks off with this production. Mesmerizing.Everyone is pitch perfect, which I believe explains the casting awards.

The story is dark but it never gets to dark. It adds some humor every now and then which is done well. Also there is not a lot of Action so if your looking for a Action filled series this is not for you. Dialogue is well written you can tell that a lot of time was put into the shows script. Cinematography is absolutely jaw dropping they have some beautiful shots in the first 3 episodes. There is 0 shaky cam for those that hate it. I hope this show has a long run because it's fantastic and it really stands out from the rest of the crime shows out right now. Overall I recommend this show to people that are looking for a stellar story. Absolutely brilliant 10/10*Edit* 2/24/14: Just finished episode 6 and I like how this is all playing out. I am really looking forward to watching the rest of the season.*Edit* 3/10/14: Now that True Detectives first season is over.

Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023.

Mcconaughey's character is a multi layered, conflict ridden pessimistic, walking black whole with a uniform and a brilliant mind, Harrelson plays the family man cop with a bigger heart and a down to earth perspective - the clashes of both ways of life are amazing and when both actors discuss deep topics, each with his own take on life, it's as good as anything they've ever played. The story is shocking and still simple so far (only first episode has aired at the time of this review) which it makes up for in the awesomeness of the pagan thematic, it leaves plenty of hints and cliff hangers at the end of the first episode so there may still be very interesting twists to it.

They aren't enemies but they aren't exactly friends either. The dialogues they share together are some of the most interesting filmmaking I've ever seen. They aren't good men or bad men either.

I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.Season 1 verdict: If I had to give only season 1 a rating, I would give it a 9/10 with no hesitation, and possibly even a 10/10. The show was everything I had hoped for and more.Needless to say, I was excited for season 2. I waited for the entire show to air so that I could binge watch it without having to wait a week between episodes. I eagerly turned on the first episode of season 2, but as the episode dragged on it became apparent that this episode was a real let down. It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. \"Hey, that's okay\" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved. Instead, I continued to be disappointed by episode after episode. Sadly, it became very clear that Season 2 sucks. I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result. Season 2 is basically unwatchable.Most of Season 2 involves a few seriously depressed brooding alcoholics staring at each other with sad serious faces uttering dark cheesy lines like \"Those moments, they stare back at you, you don't remember them, they remember you\". I mean, come on, really? The whole thing is just cheesy and I lost all interest in the problems of these people. I want to give Vince Vaughn some credit here, because he did some fantastic acting, but that couldn't come close to redeeming this season.Season 2 verdict: Don't even bother with season 2 unless you like being disappointed.

We then go to \"June 16, 2022\" and Amanda is seen hiding in a car under a blanket, apparently on her way back to Perugia, where this twisted tale got started... At this time we are 5 minutes into Episode 1.Couple of comments: first of all, there seems to be a number of reviewers who give this mini-series a (very) high rating because, as we all know, Amanda's conviction was eventually overturned, and not whether this is or isn't a great true crime mini-series (have they even seen the mini-series?). Second of all, this is not an \"objective\" mini-series, far from it. In fact, per the series closing credits, the series is based on the 2015 best-selling memoir by Amanda called \"Waiting To Be Heard\". And for good measure, Amanda is credited as one of the series Executive Producers (listed right above Monika Lewinsky, no, for real). So what you are getting here is Amanda's version of what happened, nothing more, nothing less. It is on that basis that I struggled getting through the initial 2 episodes, as the from get-go, the Italian authorities are portrayed as fumbling-bumbling-stumbling Inspector Clouseau (of the Pink Panther movies) copy cats, with a never-ending series of questionable interrogation tactics and correlated investigative procedures. Is that how it really happened? We have no clue but I can't help to have some doubts that what really happened isn't so grossly one-sided as is being presented here. The good thing is that the Amanda Knox case will continue to attract major interest from the public at large, and that almost certainly one day a more objective and independent version of the facts will be presented.The initial 2 episodes of \"The Twisted Case of Amanda Knock\" started airing earlier this week, and are now also streaming on Hulu, where I watched this last night. The remaining 6 episodes will be released on a weekly basis (on Wednesdays). If you are interested in hearing from the one-sided horse's mouth what really happened in this case, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion (even if the conclusion has already been drawn for you).",

I kept checking ChatGPT while watching to compare what was real and what was dramatized. I will say I was disappointed that some moments in the show didn't actually happen - I wish they had stuck closer to the real story.That said, the acting and cinematography are excellent.

Amanda did not even have a lawyer and was too young to understand not to say things without a lawyer.

Nowadays they are awful. More guns, empty characters, and explosions plus bad scripts than anything else. How in the world TWD transformed into a Steven Seagal movie? I remember the beginning was so thrilling  suspenses, a story, characters that you cared about, scary zombies. But after season 3 or 4 everything turned into guns and people fighting people. Cheap scripts, retarded dialogues, poor CGI. Take any episode from season 4 on and you can broadcast it on a cheap TV station as \"action\" movie. No one would tell the difference.Right now you cannot care about any character. Bad actors that play as much as the trees in the background die by the dozen by each episode. Flashbacks and \"emotional\" (dumb) dialogues want to make us care about someone. But you can't. Zombies do not matter anymore, only rarely when they suddenly matter. It is either this image of them as \"pests\" most of the time, or lethal killers out of a sudden. I am sick of watching a cheap action movie that has nothing to do with a zombie movie. A zombie movie was a zombie movie because of the thriller surrounding this worldwide catastrophe of people turning into these creepy and horror things. That was the MAIN factor. TWD has nothing to do with that anymore.If TWD would have kept 4-5 main characters and presented their struggle to live in this horror world full of zombies, then that could have been a great series. But even that has to stop. The only reason TWD continues is money. That's all. They make more money off the show. Why do you think the action happens in forests and zombies are mainly seen in packs from distance? Because it is cheap. No need to pay for shooting in a town and pay for complex CGI, a forest is perfect.So. I loved this series but now I think it is the cheapest garbage out there. Honestly I don't care what happens anymore so I'll finally give up. Last episode \"Some Guy\" did it for me. I just could not bare anymore. I don't care who dies, who lives, because there is no story, no character, nothing intelligent about this series, nothing to watch.Garbage.",

The writers creativity have been depleted for a few seasons now, there has been no direction, no gradual learning, no story development. All the physical moving around is just the illusion of story to mask the fact that there isn't a story being told at all. The show isn't going anywhere. I have stopped watching, and I feel liberated from this burden of a show. TWD has slowly decomposed into a gross, unintelligent TV show. Who keeps making gas, electricity... but then there's no radio communication... What happened to the military, the government, smart people, common sense...

I know people here are attracted to this genre for various different reasons but i'd like to think we all share some connection when zombies are involved. For me its the post apocalyptic scenario. I don't particularly need the gore element but it has its place when used well.In Darabonts take on the apocalypse, you are there. The world is dead and rotting. The military have lost the battle. You wake up with Rick in this new world and get to explore it with him. Its the exposition of the pilot that will probably put the gorehounds off and lead to some small criticism from others. Personally, i want to see that. I want to know how society responded to the phenomenon.Those who have read the comic books here know that Kirkmans trick is to get you attached to the characters, like you know them intimately, then kill them off. Here Darabont uses the same trick but not how you would expect nor with who you would expect.Im personally invested in this series already. God knows what it will do to the average TV viewer. Im also not a particularly emotional person but i don't mind admitting that i was close to tears on a couple of occasions. There you go. I've said it. Just don't tell anyone.I cant say enough about Frank darabont after watching this. He understands what this genre is all about and, more importantly, he understands Romero's zombie world. The zombies are Roamers and lurkers. They act how they should and you do feel sorry for them. This is explored really well. They are a small threat but in groups all riled up and hungry. Well, you know the rest.The score is also outstanding. Very understated but poignant. The cinematography is worthy of a movie and the camera moves a lot. I cant recall any shaky cam which some people here seem to despise.Kirkman, Darabont and AMC have come up with the series we have been waiting years for. Long may it continue, and you know what? I think it will. The balance is perfect between a horror film, TV show and intelligent drama.Oh and btw. Keep getting people onboard with this. Co workers. Non zombie lover friends. Anyone. They wont think you're weird. They'll thank you. The Lost crowd are going to lap this up.",

As he makes his way through the dark hospital he finds out that he is the only one that's not in a body bag.The pilot introduces us to several main characters that actually make you want to learn more about them, with brilliant directing by Frank Darabont you will come across both dramatic and emotional scenes that seem appropriate for the time, this gives the show allot of realism and just works out great.However this doesn't have CGI effects yet and should be kept that way, the make-up on the zombies are fantastic.watching this will give you allot of nostalgia and the direction makes of this show feel like a classic old school zombie movie from the 80's to 90's that's actually serious this time, having a well respected cast and great acting makes this show very promising and I will be hoping for allot more future episodes... allot more. But for now I'm still waiting for the rest of the first season.If you like zombies or even a good drama that has allot of suspense then I highly recommend this show, I have never felt this way about a show since LOST, so you know it's that good.",

            "review": "So after reading the review \"An honest perception\" I felt like I needed to write my own review. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. However, that being said I have to disagree with the reviewer.So here are the reasons I like the show.First, character development, this is not usually a very big trait in the Zombie genre. If you only watched 3 episodes, this is a big part of what you watched. They take the time to give you a slight background of the characters, a chance for you to get to know them. For those of us that are big fans of the Zombie genre it gave us a chance to think \"Who would I be?\" in this situation.Second, the story doesn't follow a straight line. This was a point of contention in the other review. I personally like the multiple story lines. It keeps things interesting and keeps it from becoming a boring show where I can foresee how everything is going to turn out. And before anyone says itYES I know this is based off a graphic novel. I haven't read it and will refrain from reading it for a while.Third, the zombies look and act pretty bad ass. The make up is done great, not a bunch of CGI which is so common in today's world. So anywayif you aren't a fan of the zombie genre to begin with then yeah, you probably aren't going to get why so many of us love the show. However, I think most fans of the genre will love this show.So in closing, for those of us who love the genre, It's a weekly dose of zombie apocalypse.For those that aren't fans of the genre, when the zombie apocalypse happens and you don't know what to dodon't come crying to me and my friendsyou'll just slow us down.On second thoughtyou may come in handy in case we need to make a hasty retreat",

So, when I heard The Last of Us series was in the works at HBO from Chernobyl creator Craig Mazin and The Last of Us creative director Neil Druckmann in 2020, I was so excited. They worked together to write and produce this project. I was nervous because I hope they would not to fail as in another video games like Resident Evil, Tomb Raider, Mortal Kombat, Doom, and more. Many video games always fail when adapted to television or movies because they don't respect the source material, and they just want to do their own thing. They just with the name for branding. That's why. But in, \"The Last of Us\", HBO did follow the source material well. I'm relieved! I watched the first episode of The Last of Us last night. It was the best video game adaptation I've ever seen! It was historic! It was the perfect episode! As I watched the series, I felt like I was back playing the game. The series was a wonderful balance of adding a more detailed backstory while maintaining the heart of the source material. I was impressed! Minor deviations are done very nicely. The cast is awesome and played their roles as they were in the game. To all the losers that who complained about how terrible Bella Ramsey is in the character portrayed as Ellie in the Last of Us; you are ignorant. Don't watch the series then, just go play the game and stay in the game and enjoy the character in the game all you want. It's so ridiculous! Open your mind! It's an adaptation! Bella did awesome in first episode. I can't wait to see how she does in the further episodes. Now I see All the Bella haters are very quiet today! Of course, incredible cinematography and awesome shots in the car and plane crash scenes. In my opinion those were the best scenes of the year!

I watched some of the game footage on you tube and there is a lot here that is identical to the game so thats a plus for fans of the game plus it works for a TV show so kudos to the game makers.The story and overlying themes are very simple and relate to parenting and how we protect our children or the young.It could have had more Cordyceps and more action in places but this was more of a drama surrounding the struggles of a broken world.Overall ill give it an 8 out of 10 a very good Tv Show that stays loyal to its source and was very well produced.**** Update *******Ill start by saying I've never played the games, I've no idea how true to the source it is.The first episode was very impressive, they told hold back here and emotionally you are involved quite early on.The prologue was informative but understated, The opening was brilliant and as good as anything you would see in a movie.The middle section is good and paced well to provide enough information going forward as to the objective the players and whats happened to the world outside.The episode ends at the start of an adventure.... I hope this quality remains throughout the show so the adventure is as good as the opening ( a hard act to follow ).Ive enjoyed the characters so far, not all likeable but our lead Pedro Pascal is familiar and trustworthy and does a good job. Bella Ramsey of Game of Thrones fame plays the female lead, I really hated her in Game of Thrones, her acting is a bit less wooden here so I hope I don't end up hating her in this. So far she has been fine.Its only 1 episode but its probably a 9 out of 10. I would be shocked if they can keep up this sort of standard and narrative throughout the series. Having said that there is plenty of scope for some interesting scenes. Im not a big fan of Zombie films or shows but can find them entertaining. ( I found Black Summer S2 brilliant )I hope this doesn't turn out to be just another zombie show.9/10 ( Ep1)",

Changing him was a mistake-Ellie had a different personality in the games. Changing her was a mistake.-Joel is cast perfectly, and is the sole acting talent lending any credibility.-Episode 3 was 45 minutes of backstory for non-cannon characters that did not shape the story of the main characters at all. If you fell asleep for 45 minutes of that episode, not only would you miss noting about the characters, but it would not even break narrative continuity.I urge you all to watch the 2013 \"cut scene movie\" of The Last of Us, available free on youtube.

            "review": "I'm not here to comment on the relationship to the video game this show is adapted from, I don't play games like that and don't know or care anything about them. From a purely cinematic point of view, this show is excellent thru the three episodes I have seen so far. Art direction and set decoration is superb, as is cinematography. Performances range from adequate to damn good. Writing is topnotch, I was not expecting much from a show with this one's premise -- I don't even bother watching any of the \"Walking Dead\" shows for that reason -- but the way in which they introduced the storyline, the various backstories, the human consequences and endurance of catastrophe, are all very well constructed and detailed, dialog is appropriately sparse yet nothing important is left out.In particular, S1E3 is one of the most dramatically beautiful episodes of any show I've ever seen, thanks to the lovely guest performances of Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett, and the poignant voice of the glorious Linda Ronstadt in the soundtrack. That episode alone deserves 10 out of 10 stars. Since it's early yet, I'm reserving judgment on the overall series and being conservative with that rating, (the 8 is really 8.5 rounded down), but I'm definitely looking forward to the rest of the season.Edited 3/14/23:...\nI'm inclined to downgrade the show overall after watching the season-ending 9th episode. I would say the first 8 episodes deserve a 9 out of 10 stars rating, but the awful insanity of the 9th episode brings it back down to a 7 now. There is no acceptable excuse for what the writers made Joel do in episode 9, regardless of the grossly cold explanation they offered in the post-episode interviews. If Joel does not get the death he deserves in S2E1, I will probably stop watching after that. But I may stop watching anyway, just because I don't see any point to the show continuing with or without his now thoroughly ruined character -- the development of his relationship with Ellie is one of the crucial things that made it work so well for 8 episodes, and it was a relationship that had a foundation of honesty, which has just been shattered for no good reason. Regardless of any statement to the contrary, Ellie must always have doubts about Joel's morality and truthfulness going forward, and I have no desire to see that played out.",

As an avid watcher of that series from the very beginning I cannot be impressed with this. While The Walking Dead lost its way in the later years, the take off from the graphic novels was genius. This series appears to be directed towards those people who either missed watching TWD or were too young to watch.

But I was still skeptical. But now that I got to watch the first episode at a screening, It was a lot better than I expected. A lot. Everything was on point. Like it's not a scene to scene adaptation of the game. But what it totally succeeds at is capturing the heart, lore, vibe, world of the The Last of Us. And with utter perfection. The acting is on point. I knew Pedro was going to be amazing as Ellie but I was skeptical about Nico as Sarah & Bella as Ellie. But watching this episode has removed any and all worries I had. Bella totally killed it as Ellie. I never thought I'd say this but she really did. The change from tendrils to spores is something I'm not a big fan of but it works here pretty nicely. Many scenes & dialogue are straight from the game. All that said, the production design is brilliant, the cinematography is what you'd expect from an HBO Original. And I haven't seen many other reviews praising Gustavo's work. Gustavo, the composer kills here with his incredible score same as the games.And I never ever though I was going to say this but this is actually a pretty faithful adaptation of Bruce Straley & Neil Druckmann's work then years ago.Sorry if this has grammatical & language errors, English is not my first language.",

It's probably quite a bit better than usual gruel we get from streaming platforms.But it went after a bar that's way too high for it. It follows the story of the game pretty closely, even re-enacting memorable scenes down to camera angles, such as when protagonists first saw the overtaken city and such. It changes story here and there, but often it works quite well. I don't mind Sarah being... different. I don't mind re-imagining how things went here or there. I actually quite like little flashbacks/whatever scenes about stuff that builds the story or explains the lore, but wasn't in the game. It's all good.As long as the core premise holds. But it doesn't. I do buy Pedro Pascal, he looks like Joel, pretty much walks and talks like Joel, and feels right. But Bella Ramsey can't deliver Ellie. And it's not even her fault. Sure, she looks quite... off... and doesn't really come off or feel like a 14-year old (because she's not), but main problem is the aggressive, clueless script she's given.Story of \"Last of Us\", the game that won uncountable awards, was about a strong man coping with extreme loss, and a scared girl trying to get close to him, while slowly opening up and showing she's pretty capable on her own.Story of \"Last of US\", the HBO show, I'm not sure. Ellie in this one isn't a scared, suspicious, lonely girl trying to survive. Her very first scenes are full of cursing and gritting of teeth, she's a total badass with zero explanation to this, and goes more aggressive by every episode. The main theme just never comes through. Rather than someone Joel grows to love and care for as his own child, I keep wondering when he's going to dump her in the wilderness.Or to put it simply, they tried to add girl power where none was needed (because game had more than enough), and totally overdid it, killing the main premise.Which makes this entire show waste of time, because highly superior medium, telling that story times better, already exists.Play the game.

Aside from the sarcastic \"smart kid,\" who at least brings a spark of wit to his scenes, the performances range from wooden to outright cringeworthy. It's a parade of C-tier acting that does nothing to sell the gravity of the story. And the tone? Pure CW. Every scene feels like it's aimed at a teenage audience more interested in angsty stares than in the moral darkness at the heart of King's work.Pacing is another issue. By halfway through episode two, we'd seen little more than shallow character introductions and clumsy exposition. The supposed tension never arrives. Atmosphere is non-existent. Instead of pulling me into a dark psychological maze, the series kept me at arm's length with bland dialogue and a flat visual style.We pulled the plug after 1.5 episodes. Not out of impatience, but because it was clear this wasn't going anywhere worth following. It's a shame-there's real potential in The Institute's source material, but this adaptation strips it of nuance and replaces it with hollow drama beats.Unless you're a die-hard fan of low-stakes teen thrillers, don't waste your time.

You need to hook your audience as soon as you can or lose them. One specific important character that was in the book should have been introduced earlier. Pull out the William Goldman, Sy Field, or Robert McKee. Missed opportunity is the specific social commentary in the novel seems absent here. It is a tough one to say about the actors but uninspired for some might be the best description along exhaustion. I am not sure the night shoots had a part in that. Wishing for a jolt of espresso for some. What is refreshing is normally good girl Parker and normally bad boy Barnes have a bit of a role reversal with Parker being the antagonist and Barnes being the protagonist.

The fault of this one, in my opinion, falls squarely on the shoulders of the writers. Had this challenge been placed in more capable hands, I believe it could have had serious potential of becoming an excellent series. Some creators - take Mike Flanagan for instance - take the time and effort to truly understand the source material and recognize what can be changed to enhance the adaptation for the screen. In the case of The Institute, the changes the writers made had the opposite effect. The character of Ms. Sigsby, for instance, is little like the character in the novel. Had her part been adapted properly, and placed in the very capable hands of Mary-Louise Parker, it would have made a world of difference. Ms. Parker is an extremely talented and versatile actor and would have taken this series to a higher level, had her role been better written. Also disappointingly, Ben Barnes' talent is mostly wasted here as well. To sum it up, it's doubtful I'll continue watching this series. Maybe in a few years, we'll be fortunate to get a re-boot with a properly written adaptation.",

But criticism about the plot or the pacing or everything else is just baseless hate.The show after the initial 15mins or something had me HOOKED and binging through all available 5 episodes, I have no idea how anyone can watch this show and dont want to know what happens next, a kid gets abducted and wakes up in a weird insttute where he has to supposedly \"serve humankind\" by absolving \"tests\" against his will, it revolves around supernatural stuff but you can feel they are not training these kids to become a superhero, there is something really dark and sinister going on.Since this is more of a mystery/horror show, I feel like you dont need to spend too much time on character development and exploring their past to justify their point of view, no, they are just bad people, doing bad stuff for their personal gain and because its their job, and their lack of empathy towards the kids is what makes the show horrifying at times. Also the show has the atmosphere of Stephen Kings \"The Long Walk\", lingering death that is inevitable, brought to you by people who act robotic, devoid of human emotion.",

            "review": "Wow. I just finished episode 12 of the first season of this show. As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I feel like I'm about 12 years old again. To me, the thing about the Star Wars universe that fascinated me was never the jedi, or the mysticism, or the lightsabers. All that was cool, but to me, the fascination was for the struggle. The underdog vs the world. The fight against oppression. From the original series, Wedge was my favorite character- just a regular guy doing his part.Return of the Jedi was always my favorite, despite its flaws. The reason was the epic battle sequence at the end. Unlike basically every piece of star wars media since, ROTJ's battle focused extensively on regular 'people'. This is what the Ewoks represented- an oppressed civilisation. It's a little hokey in practice, but the message was the important thing. Likewise, the space battle was all regular pilots doing their best to survive a last-ditch battle. Green Leader going out of control and kamikazi-ing the super star destroyer, Wedge and Lando shooting out the reactor. Again, these were regular people doing their bit to fight the empire. The Rebel Alliance is built on THEIR backs, not those of some space wizard (all respect to Luke).To me, Star Wars media lost sight of that until Rogue One. Here, they continue (or start) the tradition by focusing on Andor.Let's be clear, Cassian Andor is not really the protagonist here. The Rebel Alliance is, and Cassian is the perspective through which we are seeing it, as a regular guy down on his luck finding his way in the galaxy despite a world of harshness thrown at him. Likewise, we see it from the perspective of its architects, Mon Mothma, a politician doing it 'straight', and Luthen Rael, a spy/terrorist playing the deeper, more violent game. We also see the Empire as the antagonist, through the eyes of those who wish for order, like Syril Karn, and a promising and talented ISB agent, Dedra Meero.There are no jedi or lightsabers here, and surprisingly few battles and pew-pews. Almost no jokes, and (amazingly) no \"I have a bad feeling about this.\"What we get instead, and what I have needed from this franchise for a very long time, is incredible acting. Unbelievably good writing, and fantastic attention to detail. This is one of the most well-made shows I've ever seen. Every character's action, good or bad, makes sense here. This is Star Wars, the Real Drama, where I can simultaneously understand the perspective of a Rebel and an Imperial. I may not agree with one, or even both, of them, but I understand them.... I might even sympathise with them. It is like The Wire in the star wars universe. It really is THAT good.I have no notes for this. There is nothing I can imagine that would make it better. It may not be for kids or for everyone. It is slow. It has relatively little action and no humor. But- if you enjoy suspense, and tension, in a Hitchcockian way.... you MUST watch this. If you're a star wars fan who enjoyed the series for those regular men and women in the background, then again, you must watch this. If you are a fan of revolutionary or antifascist history, you must watch this.I cannot wait for Season 2.OK- it's 7 May 2025. I've come back to make a slight edit after watching episodes 1-9.All I can say is... I wish there would be a Season 3. I think Season 2 is forced to be just a *little* clunky in the way it skips years between three-episode arcs... but my god is that a minor critique. The acting. The writing. The production value, set design, costumes... I do not know if it is possible to make a show that is as incredibly high-quality as this.If you aren't watching this... just watch it.If you don't enjoy the absolute tension and drama... well downvote me because we're just not on the same wavelength.I wish all Star Wars... hell all media.. was this good.",

Unburdened by the need to placate nostalgic adult-kids that grew up with the original films (or even the poor souls that grew up with the prequel trilogy and so have a nostalgic fondness for those), or the need to pass under the scrutinous eye of the studious geeks who \"know\" how the Force and hyperdrives work (as though they're real things) - Andor is free to 'simply' build interesting characters, plots, storylines and visuals to give us the dramatic framework for what is shaping up to be just a damn good story and adventure.Sadly, like Rogue One, it also stands - by example - as a reminder of what could have been. Of what a terrible wasted opportunity the rest of this latest run of Star Wars output has been (with just the occasional, infuriating glimmer of quality thinly veined through Obi-Wan and The Mandalorian).Here's hoping the rest of this series manages to capitalise on this great start, and leaves us with at least one more properly good piece of work in this third age of Star Wars.",

Disney should have made shows and movies based on all those novels written under the label of Star Wars Expanded Universe. Those material is not perfect but easy superior to all those bad stories written on auto-pilot. The money to get the rights for them would have been well spend.

The characters act sensibly and their actions never feel like they are purely made to drive the plot forward. I think the last time I used the term 'sci-fi that transcends it's boundary' was when talking about Battlestar Galactica. I think I can safely use that term here too. It's not a action sci-fi, so it's audience it probably smaller, so I hope it will not get cancelled. I hope Disney can find the courage to front a show based on quality and not just audience numbers.

The force is indeed strong with this dark, grounded show, which comfortably departs from the Star Wars formula in significant ways.A gritty, layered prequel to the highly popular (and also prequel) movie Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Andor follows Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) on a five-year journey as he grows from a revolution-averse, shifty, cynical con man to a selfless, Empire-defying rebel against the Galactic Empire. When confronted with enemy after enemy, Andor continually proves himself to be the perfect sort of spy, revolutionary and killer.Thank you, Tony Gilroy, for creating this series. It's simply incredible. Driven by mood, Andor seems more like a crime drama or a Ridley Scott sci-fi film than a true Star Wars film. Though the first two episodes are a bit slow and offer pretty low-stakes, with lots and lots of exposition, Luna pushes the series, one of his best performances yet, to excellence. Episode three, especially, is WOW. His power to add nuance to what starts as a one-dimensional personality - surly dude disillusioned with his surroundings - is remarkable. We're lucky he reprised his role. Adding a tiny note here, I love how Luna keeps his native Mexican accent in all his portrayals of Cassian Andor. It adds something to the role! The plot of Andor is simple enough, and this allows for both the trademark character development and world-building of the Star Wars universe and also the slow reveal of the Rebel Alliance forming. Stellan Skarsgård's portrayal of Luthen Rael is subtle without being dry, and he helps elevate the show and make it even more riveting. The production quality, much like the acting, is off the charts; every scene is engineered to be utterly stunning. Half the time the feeling of dread is offset by, \"oh my goodness, look at the sky.\" All of this - the new tone, new feel, new style - might be too different for some, but the utter novelty is to be appreciated. Finally, the beautiful score by Nicholas Britell adds so much to the retro-futurism of Andor and makes the performances pop even more.Andor promotes fighting for good causes, allowing yourself to be taken by passion, and leading others for the greater good. Beyond these lessons, it's also a master class (tonally, visually, sonically) for filmmakers playing in the sandbox. There are some sexual undertones in the first episode and violent scenes.I give Andor 4.5 stars out of 5 and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. Andor releases on Disney+ September 21, 2022.

The quality of Andor is a full head above.Or take Obi-Wan, that is a remarkable impotency of story writing and directing, having no reasons to exist but to exploit the fan base.Since Rogue One, we see another successful try to make a \"realism\" show instead of arcade.Creative script, good acting, dynamic development.

I must say I loved the Outlander books, but I'm not a fanatic when it comes to translating books to the screen they are very different mediums and thus can take on a different look and feel and that's OK with me. In this case, I don't think people who are would be disappointed anyway as the screen writers did an excellent job of translating the 1st part of the book to the screen (I've only seen the 1st episode but I'm already hooked so I'm sure I'll enjoy the rest).I loved their choice of actors to take on the roles of Jamie, Claire, Frank and Dugan. Sam Heughan is perfect as Jamie Fraser (just the right bit of good looks and ruggedness one might expect in Jamie). Caitriona Balfe also seemed like a good choice for Claire (beautiful yet strong enough to carry the role). I think Frank/Jack Randall's portrayal by Tobias Menzies will also fit my vision of Frank/Jack and I think he can carry off both roles one as the wicked Jack and the other as the loving yet dull Frank (when compared to Jamie). And the Scottish actors like Graham McTavish (Dougal) will bring old Scotland to life on the screen for me.From the 1st episode I think they producers will not be shy to include the more sexual aspects of the Outlander books, as they do have this erotic element that actually makes the love between Claire and Jamie the driving force of their relationship which allows it to span centuries, even when they are no longer together. It's that love/passion for each other that keeps them alive in each other's heart and so far to the directors credit, they have not been shy about adding it. I'm looking forward to the Claire Jamie love scenes hopefully to come... I'm also going to enjoy the Scottish history and scenery, and loved the way they so far have included it in the TV series. It's going to be very interesting to me especially as my ancestors are Scottish.I know Starz will be increasing its revenues with this series' fans all signing up just to see it. There must be millions of us around the world that love these books and I'm sure like me many of them will order the cable channel just to watch this. I'm very happy to see Starz did such a good job in bringing this to life on the screen. So rarely do we get a good adult drama on TV these days, and this will surely be that. I'm liking many of the original show Starz is offering this season like this and Black Sails, Strikback. Who ever is heading their creative development deserves a lot of credit for their selection of shows to produce. I think Starz is catching up to HBO and Showtime in it's original shows and might even surpass them if it keeps producing shows of this quality plus they have a much better selection of movies that the other channels. As a new Starz member, I'd recommend it to others.",

They claim that they wanted to show how hard it is to deal with trauma, alone and inside a relationship. Bullocks. It's torture and rape porn, and it's bad for your soul.There's a worrying tendency in TV series (another example is Game of Thrones) to show very graphic, detailed, prolonged scenes of torture.

The first dull hour I watched only had enough story for twenty minutes of film at best. What's even more annoying is that much of the outrageous padding is due to the almost constant narration that stretches out every non-dialog scene. Its tedious and redundant, adding to nothing but the running time. The entire first episode could have easily been edited down to 20 minutes. Zzxxxxxxxxx zzzzzzzzzz",

Answer: A believable story line, good pacing and direction, intelligent social context reflecting values of the 18th century rather than that of the 21st.As to bodice ripping and dialogue like \"I'll thank ye to take yer hands off me wife,\" this is adolescent storytelling at its most laughable. It is a cartoon brought to life. In spite of an occasional stab at looking into the depth of a villain, it melts into a goo of modern political correctness. Quiet scenes are invariably interrupted by gratuitous violence in which...yes...bodices are actually ripped. Not just once, but at every hint of a damsel in distress. The villain leers and the audience recoils. Instead of simply shooting the rascal when he gets the chance, the hero makes some incomprehensible statement about honor, letting the guy go to abduct his wife yet again (no doubt ripping her bodice in the process). And so on.Update 10 Jul 2016: Watched to the bitter end. Still like the sets, costumes, etc., but hated the needless sensational and soapy bits.",

I think the casting of the lead roles is perfect. The locations and sets evoke each of the time periods portrayed. The music is amazing; it adds character to the events as they unfold and I'm looking forward to hearing more in later episodes. There is some criticism about the pace of EP1, I agree that it felt a bit slow. Viewers who feel it's too slow, please note that the book is about 800 pages long! Additionally, Starz bought 16 EPs rather than the usual 10, so that RDM has time to develop the story line and the many characters that appear in the book. The voice over takes some getting used to, since it's not a common practice today. So I refer back to the book again, because the reader is let into the lead character's thoughts most of the time - it's not all dialogue. You don't have to read the book to enjoy the show and I believe new viewers who give it a chance over the next several EPs as the action in the story picks up won't be disappointed and will appreciate what all the fan fuss is about.",

Seasons 1, 2 and (arguably) 3 were fantastic with Sam Heughan perfectly cast as Jamie Fraser a man whose honour, morals and care for others came before all else and whose love for Claire is no doubt the envy of many viewers.We binge watched it, enjoying every moment from the theme tune at the start through to the end. It was on course for a solid 8 star rating........ and then something changed that resulted in the 3 star rating. All the love we had for the programme instantly vanished with one of the most absurd story lines: Jamie and Claire being washed overboard during a storm in the middle of the Atlantic... and then... by some miracle rivaling that of Jesus's resurrection... ending up on the SAME foreign beach together, which happens to be.... *cue the drum roll*.... America - instantly updating the definition 'damp squib'.Disappointed but not put off we waited for the release of Season 4, convincing ourselves the absurd ending of Season 3 was a moment of script writer madness...... but no, the same RIDICULOUS story continues into Season 4. Lazy script writers who should have been fired at this point produce episodes that go beyond the realms of absurd.Sadly, the result of this sheer laziness means the magic Outlander once had has gone and instead has been replaced with us bemoaning the story lines and speech.So, it is left by us asking, if by some 'magic stone circle' miracle a producer from Outlander happens to read this, then please, either:\n1. Bring the show to a suitable end.\n2. Replace your script writers with ones who care.\n3.

I learned that most of the reviewers bashing it have only seen a few (at most) episodes from the first season - many haven't seen it at all, and are simply bashing it because of an overwhelming sense of pride in the original. I'd be surprised if this review isn't skimmed over and marked unhelpful by them. Obviously I'm not speaking to all the British, but the majority that unfairly judge this show with little to no basis in the truth.This whole fanaticism is juvenile and petty. The casts of the US and UK versions love each show. Ricky Gervais even wrote and executive produced a few episodes of the US version. Open your minds, people! Most of the US fans KNOW that it's based on a British version. It has gotten the credit it deserves for being a brilliant and hilarious show.But the American version is also brilliant and hilarious. I've read comments ranging from 'bad acting' to 'direct copy', neither of which are true. The first season may have had its borrowed bits, but that was to get it on its feet. The second and third seasons have proved that it is a show entirely on its own, with scenarios and characters having NOTHING to do with the UK version at all. The acting is just as convincing and real as the UK version.I've even read that Michael Scott is devoid of David Brent's humanity! In actuality, Michael Scott is shown as far more human than David Brent, who was more manipulative (albeit, poorly) and heartless. The US version still has the cruel elements of the UK version, but it balances these awkward, painful moments with tender, human moments, which makes it more enjoyable and watchable.As for the humor, each show has its own moments of subtlety, detail, absolutely outrageous moments, awkwardness, pain, cuteness, ridiculousness, and vulgarity. The UK version was groundbreaking. But instead of blindly basing your opinions on bias and arrogance, see the US version for what it is - a brilliant, brighter version that, in its first season, simply used the framework of the original (the characters and basic situations) to get started with.This is the funniest, smartest American television show in recent history besides Arrested Development. Not since Seinfeld has a show made me laugh so hard and smile so much. These three shows get better with each viewing and are great because there's so many levels of humor, from the apparent outrageousness to the minute details that are noticed after repeated viewings and are often funnier than the surface material.",

However, once the writers came up with original story lines and situations the, American, office really took off. The second season was an incredible achievement and is just carrying on where it left off in the third season.Steve Carell is well suited to the role of Micheal Scott, lending his character a certain pathetic quality that even Gervais's David Brent did not have at times. The supporting cast is equally as good, especially Rainn Wilson as the assistant (to the) general manager, Dwight Shrute.

One of the funniest aspects of the characters of David Brent, Gareth Kenan et al was their political incorrectness, especially David who didn't even realise what a bigot he was being. It seems that somebody has decided that it needed to be toned down for the American remake, and toned down it was. Most of the jokes have lost much of their impact.The same thing goes for the swearing. The language of the original was extremely blue, as the workplace depicted in the show was massively male-dominated, and as anyone who knows who has happened to work in such an environment will know, manners just seem to completely evaporate in such an environment. Again, this has been toned and again this has hurt the show.There was new material here but I didn't think it was all that funny.But the biggest disappointment is that the actors sound like actors. The original sounded like a real documentary because of the style used, with the actors stumbling over their lines and uming and erring a lot as people in real life tend to do.

I finished watching the first episode about 5 minutes ago, which had the same plot and script as the first episode of its British counterpart. For one thing, Jim's character (Tim in the original) was totally mis-cast. He's too handsome and confident to play the shy but lovable loser portrayed by Martin Freeman in England. Second of all, and more importantly, the acting (while quite funny) was still very clearly acting. In the original show, Ricky Gervais led a cast that delighted us by acting perfectly. We were 100% drawn into the plot and characters. Gervais drove us into hysterics with his portrayal of David Brent. Please, before it's too late, rent season one of the original office and watch it and see what i mean. The original show was brilliant, and this is totally mediocre. I am not a snobby person who likes British TV better because it's British. The Office is the only British show I watch...it only aired for two seasons, and including the Christmas special ending only runs eight hours. Rent it now, please.",

If the Americans can't handle the BBC Office in all its glory, well, that's sad, but that's how it goes. Don't \"dumb it down\". You never forget that these people are actors, whereas the original cast were so superb that it was actually at times hard to tell whether or not it's real. The American Office doesn't even have the \"American\" sense of humour - so why? What is the point? If you're going to shoot it the same show but altered for the American audience, you should actually alter it for the audience you're targeting! In essence exactly the same, except with an American cast, bad acting, and not funny. Waste of time and an insult to the genius of the original show.",

It blew.I was willing to give it a chance and I forced myself to sit through the entire episode hoping it would redeem itself since I'm a Steve Carell fan, but alas, it continued on it's path of dullness. The beauty of the BBC version was that although the characters were over the top at times, the actors performed with the utmost subtlety. The acting here is way over the top, to the point where you can't believe that a character like Dwight exists. And as for Carell, he's no Ricky Gervais.This NBC version feels like a bad high school drama adaptation of The Office. Same jokes, somehow made unfunny.Makes me appreciate the original even more.",

The script was pretty much WORD FOR WORD (apart from the very ODD lame attempt to cover up the fact they weren't professional or indeed creative enough to be original by throwing in a couple of American versions of the jokes that featured in the English version). I have watched the English version more than a few times and as a result I know the episodes fairly well. While looking at the American version I found myself pretty much able to say a line from the script before the character even said it. I think thats a true testament to what I've said above about it being word for word. Also the acting.......The words \"wooden\", \"unprofessional\" \"uncomfortable\" and \"trying to hard\" spring to mind. They have taken one of the most classic shows ever to be broadcast in Britain and turned it into a mockery.

The characters were always interacting with sly looks and body language. In the US version there is too much dialog and at times you feel they are just talking to line up the next joke so I becomes tedious.Some may feel that this a completely different show that should be judged on its own merits.

SUBTLETY.That in itself is a very vague criticism, I know. There is nothing wrong with the writing, the acting, the production or much else with the American version. The problem is, it just doesn't work in the US as it does in the UK. And that, I think is because of the nature of British people. Reserved, socially awkward, introverted; ie a load of stuff that Americans (thankfully for you guys) aren't, and the genius of the original is that it hits the mark because of the social inadequacies of Brits in the work place. Because of that, the subtlety of the gags and situations which work in the original just don't quite hit the mark.Listen, I am the biggest fan of US sitcoms there is. Seinfeld, Frasier, the Simpsons and Friends are amongst my all time top 10.

This show involves some humor, unlike ER, but you also get the blood and guts popping out, very sad moments, more involved stories about the DR's personal life's, issues that are bombarding our medical care in this country today and the great music puts it over the top.

As the follow-up riding on \"Housewives'\" coattails, I was ready to dismiss it outright as \"Ally McBeal in hospital scrubs.\" But not having much else to watch in that time slot, I decided to give it a try, and was I pleasantly shocked! Though there ARE some moments where the principal characters come off as self-centered, neurotic and at times downright eccentric, it never reached the level of absurdity that \"Ally\" often did, and thank God for that! Ellen Pompeo as Dr. Meredith Grey comes off as likable and probably more self-aware and introspective than self-absorbed and scatterbrained, though there are moments you do want to reach into the screen and give her a good shaking.And good call on the ensemble casting! You really have to give props to any show that FINALLY figures out how to effectively showcase the sweet-and-sour charms of Sandra Oh, who was good enough to elevate a sow's ear of a show like \"Arli$$,\" if not to save it. And not to mention give assorted actors who have all been great in projects not up to their talents, the chance to really shine in some very well-written roles, and I want to single out Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers, Chandra Wilson and especially T.R. Knight as George, who is really coming into his own as this season progresses.Not to snub Isaiah Washington, James Pickens, Jr., Kate Walsh or the so-hot-it's-criminal Patrick Dempsey.

It's totally ludicrous - doctors are very cool-headed in their work, to the point of almost lacking compassion at all - especially surgeons. They are criticized for being totally heartless, but you have to be to cut into human flesh. THey are never melodramatic the way ALL of the characters on this show are... not to mention the rotating bed partners and switching up sexuality -- although most surgeons are sleaze-bags, the philandering is usually with nurses, not with other doctors and never same-sex. Grays features all kinds of unrealistic craziness. Please give the American public a break and stop producing and airing this silly junk.",

So, on a whim, I tried out \"Criminal Minds\". I have never made a better TV decision.Criminal Minds is a psychological thriller that keeps your undivided attention. Like Law & Order, no one character gets the direct star treatment. I have seen seven episodes, and I still do not have a favorite character (which is highly unusual for me). I love them all. Every single week, this is the only show I can hardly wait for.If you like plots that keep you thinking and guessing while having plenty of physical and mention action, this show is definitely for you.",

Many may say that this is a 'rip-off' of CSI but I've watched CSI and it caught me on for a bit, but after a while it just seemed to closed. Where CSI guides you through the story and gives a picture perfect ending and how you're supposed to perceive it, Criminal Minds lets you explore and judge for yourself. It doesn't preach too much and the stories are engaging and suspenseful! Excellent writing and great performances from the stars. It may begin cliché, but if you stay long enough it is a rewarding and entertaining view, and I don't feel it's going to let down any time soon. Give it a chance, or just watch episode 7 'The Fox'. It shows the best writing and acting in the show so far, in my opinion. Diving into minds of lunatics and psychopaths has never been more entertaining! Fantastic!",

But this happens in each and every episode.Predictable per episode: - the black guy will tackle someone without any assistance just before everyone else arrives (I guess he drives in a different and faster car) - the local law enforcement are idiots and are berated as such multiple times - the word \"unsub\" will be repeated multiple times and other \"technical\" terms will be used to make the team sound extra smart and then the terms will be explained to the locals who are too stupid to understand - one character will walk into a room and ask another \"whats up?\" at which point the other character will explain some detail of the case as if the first person had no training whatsoever. In reality this is just talking directly to the audience and delivering plot points to move the story along according to the predictable fill in the blanks script pattern.Horrible, yet typical crime drama.",

And we have seen shows that we may have liked like the profiler that we know isn't correct. It doesn't happen that way. I will say that I enjoyed it.The only other show I truly miss is Fox's The Inside. That was a good one as well but nothing like this. I have bought at least ten books on profiling that discuss different types of psychopaths,how they were created and the different psychological issues that surrounds their behavior and fantasies. How because of their bad experience during childhood and after they have learned to profile and manipulate people,the disorganized crime scene compared to organized scene and mixed crime scene and what it tells you about the unsub. Learning their geographic profile. All these things are in this show to give us a pretty reasonable idea of what they do. How they are made. Why they exist and do what they do. I find it fascinating not only to watch psychopaths and their crimes but to some extent through their fiction, learn something about them. John Douglas says he saw John Gacy and looked him right in the eye when in fact he never did so I don't really take his word about what his job was like. But many others, like Robert Ressler describe this profession in a similar way as Criminal Minds. I hope it stays on. It is the coolest. Just to clarify, I like learning why they do it. I hate what they do and how it hurts people. I don't wan't people to think I enjoy entertainment for the sake of seeing people pain or horror. I think you will enjoy this show too.

We, as viewers, want to know what makes someone tick as a way to prevent crimes from occurring again.Another reason why I enjoy this showed so much is how the characters put their expertise in play to solve some of the most twisted people around.As casting is concerned: Patinkin is perfect as Jason Gideon. If you think about it, he's more like a professor citing famous lines from Einstein, Faulkner, etc.When I first read those lines, it didn't make sense at first, but as you watch each episode , the lines that Gideon cites has more meaning to it.For example: Einstein: \"Imagination is more important than knowledge.Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.\" Gideon is saying that the human mind is the deadliest weapon of all, & we are capable of anything & everything of achieving all kinds of possibilities.In conclusion, Criminal Minds is the kind the of show that anyone can enjoy.",

            "review": "Criminal Minds seems to fall in the category of popular enough that people who loves lazily written, simple to follow, repetitive garbage will watch it in masses, but bad enough that most critics, professional or online, prefers not to acknowledge its existence. I normally don't do reviews, however with this show heading into it's 9th season, proper criticism is long overdue. Crime procedurals is not a TV genre I'm a fan of and generally avoid them. However I started watching this show after seeing the short lived series Higher Ground and thinking AJ Cook really had potential. After seeing all her later movies, this show was all that's left so I started watching it and hoped it wasn't too bad. I set my standards too high.Saying this show is unoriginal is an understatement. I don't think there's a single thing about this show that wasn't taken from somewhere else. Heck the creators admits to taking ideas off real life cases. First off the characters. They are cardboard stock characters from other crime procedurals. Some of them are blatant ripoffs when I hear more about other crime procedurals like NCIS and Numbers. You got the old wise mentor, the apathetic boss, the tough guy, the socially awkward genius, the woman who can hang with the boys, the token eye candy, and stolen from NCIS, the computer expert who's suppose to be wild and funny. If they don't sound cliché enough, their distinction is maximized. For example the apathetic boss is so devoid of personality that the actor didn't felt necessary to give him any facial expressions. The tough guy is always the one tackling people. The socially awkward genius has a social past so pathetic Steve Urkel and the geeks from Big Bang Theory come off as more realistic people. The token eye candy (AJ's character) is basically a glorified extra who barely does anything. Their wardrobe never changes either just in case it's not blatant enough what type of characters these are. Boss is always wearing a suit, tough guy is dressed up like he's running a military obstacle course, genius looks like he works in a cubicle, the female agents are dressed up like GQ models and the \"funny\" computer whiz has over the top hair, layers of makeup and an outfit that overall makes her look like some sort runaway from the circus.As for the story, what story? It takes ques from CSI and every other popular CBS crime show of having that overproduced Michael Bay inspired look as well as grotesque and shocking images and ideas. CSI started this with their forensics and dead bodies while Criminal Minds seems to be aiming for as close to Saw levels. Cause you know, Michael Bay and Saw is what people like to flock to. Episodes themselves are completely by the books. Opening scene will be about the case in question. We hit credits then someone on the team will cite some historical figure at the beginning and end of every episode. This idea apparently was stolen from another crime show. Team presents the case so the audience can follow what's going on. Killer is almost always a guy, victims is almost always women, local authority is almost always incompetent morons. Team will try and piece things together while the killer is doing something that escalates the matters. This is how episodes constantly keeps you on edge. They will also play overly dramatic music to let the audience know how they should be feeling cause things aren't blatant enough already and this show likes to treat it's audience like morons. Though if people actually think this show has great writing then I guess the creators aren't wrong there. The team figures it at the end then gives a exposition dump, if they haven't already, to the audience, uh, I mean authorities like they're reading off a script. Okay they are actually reading off a script, but you're not suppose to make it look like they are. They always make it in the last moment with tough guy tackling the killer. Case has been solved in the course of a day or two. The End.This is all then repeated in a infinite loop until this show gets cancelled. Everything this show specializes is pretty much everything I hate about the crime procedural genre. There's no story or character development at all. The most you get is if something is happening to the actors in real life (like they're leaving the series) and the writers are forced to accommodate to the change. Speaking of change, the cast has been changed a number of times and the new actor generally looks like the last actor. How original. Well to be fair, they did try the bold move of replacing AJ's token eye candy with Rebecca Locke from the series the Inside. I'm not kidding, it's Rebecca Locke with Rachel Nichols playing her also, except she has CM's craptastic writing behind her. Most of what you know about the characters are given in throwaway lines that never gets followed up on. Not that it matters, whenever they do try and develop these \"characters\", it's always cringe worthy. If the writers just happens to be planning (read: not a reaction to real life) to bring in a character that gets close to a main cast, they are sure to die just for more shock value and things reset back to status quo: the way the writers like it. It's apparent shock value is the only writing skills the staff has. There's not even any concept episodes shows like these like to try out once and a while. You know the episodes that's completely different from the usually. I'm utterly convinced the writers of this series does not have a creative bone in their bodies.I cannot wait for the day this series gets cancelled cause good riddance and hopefully I can enjoy AJ Cook in something again.",

I watched the wire about 3 years ago well after the series concluded, and watched it in the same binge watching way I watched The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, and Game of thrones. I won't compare The Wire to these shows because they are not really comparable other than the fact they are some of the greatest shows ever, but are completely different. The wire isn't about drug dealing, the police, politics, or the education system, it is about the entire city of Baltimore. I'll admit The Wire isn't for everyone, it may be too violent or complex with the vast amount of characters and side stories for some, but I guarantee if you are a film and TV series lover and appreciate writing, acting, and an abundance of interesting characters, the wire is pretty much perfect in these regards. Each Season changes slightly in which facet of the city it will mainly cover, and becomes more complex as the series progresses. This show has without a doubt some of the most interesting characters, and best writing I have ever seen on a series. Even small side characters have intriguing stories that progress throughout the entire series, and I have never seen more attention to detail.

It was described as a \"gritty crime drama\" with many Baltimore locals portraying variations on themselves. The interview made it sound interesting enough that I decided to check out the first season on DVD.After the first few episodes I became seriously hooked and devoted 36 hours of the next ten days to the show.Having now watched the first 3 seasons, I believe it to be the best television series I have seen.I do not understand why this show hasn't generated the buzz or the awards of HBO's other series, such as the Sopranos or Deadwood. It is more gripping, faster paced, and more intelligent. The other shows can be a bit plodding, with plot lines that go nowhere, and a few characters I don't much care about. That wasn't the case here.The show is a cross between the Sopranos and the old NBC show Homicide: Life on the Street. The crime/sopranos side and the law/Homicide side run in parallel. Individually, the parallel plot lines are compelling. In tandem, they are complimentary and brilliant.There is no way to avoid having \"the best show ever\" tag sound like anything but silly hype--regardless, what makes this show substantially better than any other realistic and compelling crime or police drama is the fact it is... searching. It doesn't just delve into the individual psychologies motivating these people (ala the Sopranos) or the complex interactions amongst the members of a community (ala Deadwood) it asks \"what the hell can be done for all of these people\" and points out the problems with any and all of the answers.It's truly brilliant.

They know what they speak of and don't rely on cookie cutter characterization. This is the closest thing to a novel that you will find on TV. It is so impeccably plotted and so honest and realistic that I will never be able to watch another cop show (or any TV drama) without comparing it to this example of television greatness. Did I mention its also the smartest TV show on the air too? The Sopranos gets the media attention but it can't match the sophistication and grittiness of The Wire. The Sopranos is a romanticized TV crime drama by comparison. And as for Six Feet Under? Please!

On par with 'Generation Kill' (no wonder, since the same creative team was behind both), this is as good as television gets.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

            "review": "HBO's \"The Wire\", another ground breaking TV crime series from David Simon who grandfathered \"Homicide: Life on the Street\", raises the bar for crime dramas by dedicating a whole season (13 episodes) to a single story with unparalleled realism. Telling of a motley bunch of detectives who set about to bring down a Baltimore drug ring which supplies a black innercity housing project, the gritty 12 hour first year series slowly develops a broad range of characters from street punks to senators in a world where the blacks and whites of good and evil are reduced to shades of gray and everyone is connected by their humanity for better or for worse. Not the usual cops vs bad guys fare with episodic ups and downs, \"The Wire\" is one long drama about people which happens in a law enforcement and crime setting. For realists only, this series will require some viewer patience while the complexities of the plot and the characters are developed. One of a kind...so far. (A)",

            "review": "Possibly the best thing written for television ever; certainly the best to come out in the last 25 or so years.\"The Wire\" escapes the melodramatic pitfalls of shows like \"the West Wing,\" \"Six Feet Under\" and even \"The Sopranos\" (which are all smartly written--or rather have had their moments of greatness).Here is a show which over the course of 37 hours weaves together scores of very tautly detailed characters. It's not easy to watch--and its certainly challenging. But it is surely worth it.The story unfolds in Baltimore and is a study on the effect of institutions on its members: police, politicians, criminals, addicts.Some may find the show didactic. This is understandable because its creators make heavy usage of allegory (for instance, seasons three's not-so-subtle criticism of the situation in Iraq).Didactic or not, the show forces its viewers to think about and hopefully start a larger discussion of the issues it touches upon: the failure of the drug war, the gradual extinction of the American worker and the dangers of a presumptive, preemptive war.Hats off to creators David Simon and Ed Burns (a retired BPD detective) for creating one of the most interesting, daring shows in the history of television.Let's hope HBO renews it for another 26 episodes.",

            "review": "I say that without a shred of hyperbole. The Wire's importance, beyond setting the standard for all modern television, is one of a historical document. 500 years from now, the show will surely be one of a handful that allows future generations to glean the state of American society during this time period -- it's problems, it's people, it's language, it's institutions, and the constant tension that exists when all of these are forced to coexist.This is due to the fact that the Wire, through nuance and true-to- life portrayal of human interactions, constructs an extremely lucid and heart-breaking evaluation of almost every aspect of society. Most of you reading right now wake up every day as a cog in the massive, interwoven, and fundamentally autonomous institutions which together make up a capitalist society. However, given that we are all a minuscule part of this larger whole, it is nary impossible to take a step back and objectively evaluate just how much influence these institutions hold over the course of our lives. It's not unlike trying summarize a 1000-page novel while holding a single random page less than an inch from your face. Our perspectives are inherently limited in this regard, and so too is any vain attempt to connect the pieces and make sense of it all.This point is one of the many reasons that the Wire warrants our time and careful consideration. From a bird's-eye perspective, each season builds on those prior until at the very end we have no choice but to reckon with vast tapestry of individual strands as a singular work. One that feels so true to life that it's near impossible for me to think of anything else, fiction or non-fiction, book or movie, painting or play, sculpture or architectural feat, which in their combined power holds the volume of educational lessons, thoughtfulness, humanism, pure ethos, or entertainment that the Wire does.\"All the pieces matter,\" a quote that flashes across the screen at the beginning of an episode in Season One, is prophetic in it's understanding that the totality of something can have a much greater impact than its individual parts. And that is why I find it upsetting when reading reviewers which call the show \"boring\" or \"slowly paced\" or \"overrated\" and then go on to admit that they gave up watching before the end of Season Two.I am not a cynic by nature and in general tend to dismiss the common criticism that our generation is one that needs constant gratification all of the time in order to stay engaged with something for the long haul. But in this case, I truly believe that the Wire is so much different than what most people are used to watching on the medium of television that some may get confused or frustrated when the show refuses to pander to the standard beats and thrill-inducing plot devices on an episode-by-episode basis which we have been trained to expect with TV shows. There are no neatly wrapped episode arcs, no spoon-feeding over obvious plot points via voice-overs or flashbacks, and no musical score to tell us how a particular scene or moment should make us feel.Instead, the show forces us to become witnesses to a series of events in much the same way we would witness something unfolding right in front of us. Especially during Season One, David Simon and his creative team give us a lot of footage that looks like it should be from a documentary. This is all intentional, of course. The 4:3 film, the non-HD look, the way the camera seems to lack the traditional god- like power to always know that a character is going to say something important so that it shows us that character a second or two before they say their line (indeed, if you watch closely you'll notice that there are times that the camera will only pan to a speaking character after they begin saying their lines, giving the viewer the distinct feeling of a real-life situation unfolding in real time) -- all of these things are by careful design. And all of these devices add to the show's power because the characters become more real when depicted in this way. This makes it all the more devastating every time one of these characters is chewed up and spit out by the merciless wheels of capitalistic institutions surrounding them.I chose to write a review which differs from many of the others here because simply rehashing why I love Omar so much, or which season is the best, or why I think it's better/worse than the Sopranos or Breaking Bad are all things which are touched upon over and over again. Instead I wanted to provide my own analysis about why the show succeeds and stands apart of from others to the point where comparison is futile. Some people, including myself, think that the show will provide you with such an empathy-rich experience that when you have finished you may potentially see the world a little bit differently, that you'll feel a little bit closer to all of the people you share this country with, no matter how different their persona or background is from your own. By this measure, your persistence and patience given to the show will be repaid 10-fold.",

I was told that, once I'd watched it, I'd see what all the fuss was about. Well, I finally finished season 1. I won't be bothering with season 2.This is an average procedural, nothing more or less, stuffed with an array of interchangeable and forgettable characters (I couldn't for the life of me remember who was who, and soon began not to care) and clichés galore. You want the the maverick cop who plays by his own rules, speaks his mind, pisses of his stuffed-shirt, officious superiors but gets results? Whose dedication to his job has cost him his marriage and left him with a drink habit (signalled by occasional swigs at a bottle)? Well, one can never get enough of THIS sort of character, obviously, so bring him on, have him played woodenly and be done with it. You get the usual weary battery of petty, lazy, fat and/or balding officials who get in the way, just for contrast, and they all but ask for his badge and his gun and/or give him 48 hours.And so it dragged on, the self-conscious dialogue dribbling forth. You want the beautiful and ballsy lesbian cop expounding non-sensically on her reasons for being a cop to her (fortuitously gorgeous) lesbian friends? Want to see a fat cop enter his superior's office and start, for some reason, to talk about how he was masturbating in the bath? And, no, his superior does not, as in any real world, ask him to get out or get to the point, but merely smiles and nods indulgently ('cos he's an a-hole, too, geddit?). The cringe moments come thick and fast, one of my favourites being the moment that the cop I came to call Morgan Freeman interviewed the Tart-with-a-Heart (another cliché) at his desk, conveniently littered with the miniature furniture he makes (contrived plot point, there)and for some reason didn't see fit to clear away. He tells her to choose one that she likes and, yes, she chooses the cradle with the baby in it and coos, ickily.Lovers of clichés will also be able to spot who's about to get wasted in advance.

The Wire truly has no equivalent on American TV, more akin to something like the British miniseries Traffik, or Robert Altman's Short Cuts, but really in a class by itself. The show also doesn't fetch the ratings of HBO's other blockbuster series, like The Sopranos or Deadwood, but so far the network has stood behind what is indisputably a creative / artistic success. Viewers accustomed to having a Tony Soprano or an Al Swearingen to latch onto may be daunted by The Wire's 2-dozen or so \"main\" characters, all given equal importance within multiple story lines. The concurrent tales all buoy one another, and as the season draws to a close, they begin to merge and compliment each other in unexpected ways. No detail is too small to not be done with great care, and no significant threads are left to hang, which also speaks to the brilliance of the writers.The Wire is no less than a dramatic triumph, and I can't wait for a new season.",

In House I find the anti-hero that I've been waiting for in a medical show. The guy who knows everything, but is wrong often enough to keep us all guessing. I enjoy the contrast of House and his cadre of young fresh faced colleagues, complete with starched white lab coats, who struggle as much with their professionally imposed constraints, and sense of decorum, as they do with his personality. And, wonder of wonders, the use of ironic and tragic comedy is without peer in what I've seen in the TV world in recent memory. In a nutshell, I really never know what any given character will say or do and it's that freshness that will keep me coming back for more.

I LIKED that as an alternative to ER. Note that ER is my absolute favorite show, and the ONLY show I regularly watch--but they are already doing what they do, and doing it extraordinarily well; a new show ought to do something DIFFERENT, it seems to me.As for the \"when doctors make mistakes, people die\" line, the writers were obviously LAMPOONING that, as it got repeated on a soap opera that some characters were watching on T.V. So maybe the whole show was just a tad too intellectually challenging for that reviewer--and/or maybe he missed that bit running to the kitchen for a snack, and so didn't get the joke.I thought it was quite interesting, relatively original (imagine that, in a world of \"reality\" shows!), and LOTS of fun--a show about hunting for diagnostic \"zebras.\" I could definitely be fascinated on a regular basis by medical mysteries (assuming the writing stays SHARP and accurate). I suppose, though, it may not survive long, if there aren't very many people who WANT to be entertained by being stimulated to think. Or worse, the producers may listen to the \"not exciting enough\" complaints like this and then just decide to try to clone ER (and of course, not possibly actually succeed, leading to a premature death, like poor Dolly the sheep and all such clones. . . . ).Anyway, if you like a medical MYSTERY (as distinguished from, let's say, a medical THRILLER/ACTION-ADVENTURE, which genre ER already indisputably reigns over), this ought to be JUST your \"cup of tea!\"",

There are no nurses, etc--instead our good doctors do everything themselves, including spending valuable time trying to take blood or finding a lost patient. Right. As others have pointed out the episodes are severely formulaic. There are two facets to each story: 1. Fixing mystery illness 2. Bickering with each other/ sexual tension/ House's addiction, lack of sentimentality, or the ironic contrast between his skill as a doctor and his lack of empathy. The plots all go this way: 1. Scene with patient becoming ill. 2. Opening theme 3. House and etc arguing rapidly about patient's conditions; House snaps witty remarks but they settle somewhat on a hypothesis. 4. Hypothetical diagnosis wrong, patient is worsening. 5. Another diagnosis with some more doctor/doctor bickering, and some revelation on part of House's character (he still has a heart, he has lots of pain, etc). 6. Diagnosis brings patient near to death, something must be done, but what?! 7. House gets some clue, and sends junior doctor to patient's home or interrogates family member. Family member cries and/or gets angry /something radical found at home. Risky diagnosis discovered by confident House, but could be win all/lose all 8. Patient is cured. End with showing some part of House's personality (addiction, lack of sentiment, inner anguish, etc).The initial exposure to Dr. House's personality as a Sherlock Holmsey type of vicodin-addicted character is amusing. While Holmes was usually cold, House is sardonic, unsocial and bitter, and uses sarcastic humour. He also uses dark humour to deflect his interior character, which is supposed have some pain and some loneliness to give his character interest. However, after the umpteenth acrimonious but witty reply, and the umpteenth little scene showing that he isn't completely unpleasant just gets eyerollingly boring.This is how the majority of episodes play out. Once in a while it's good if you've forgotten how the last episode played out, but I found that watching this show on a regular basis just feels like a huge waste of time.",

House loves to tell the truth as he sees it, cutting through the nice happy lies that your average urban US adult tells and believes, never mind the hurt feelings he might leave lying bleeding by the roadside. But of course, his character *may* hide a heart of gold, so in the end he's trying to do the right thing. Sure, it's a formula, and House is even a stock character maybe, but it works.If the creators/writers are smart, they'll allow a little character development, especially amongst the excellent supporting cast, but not ruin it by changing House or allowing him a romance with either of his female costars. Keep that sexual tension going!For fun, catch Hugh Laurie--who is British by the way--sometime on one of the seasons of Black Adder (usually rebroadcast on PBS, but also available at better video rental shops). He plays a complete idiot and is as convincing in that role as he is as the brilliant and misanthropic Dr. House. . .",

The show has a wonderful cast and the illnesses these patients come in with are very interesting. The acting is brilliant. It hasn't really been about the doctors yet, but it's starting to get a bit more personal. Up until now (the 3rd episode), it's been mostly about the patients, which is what you want in the beginning of a show. The comic relief is that Dr. House has to do work in the walk-in clinic where every hypochondriac in New Jersey comes walking in... his dealing with them is hilarious. And just as additional enjoyment, Jesse Spencer is very pleasing to the eyes. :)",

Besides his role in the film \"Peter's Friends\", I mainly knew his work from his comedy roles in \"Blackadder\" and \"Jeeves and Wooster\". Now, having seen him in \"House\", I find that he's a fine dramatic actor, as well. From previous reviews, you'll have read that Laurie plays Dr. House, an ill-tempered, disabled yet brilliant physician who doesn't like patients, but is challenged by unusual ailments. Aided by a small team of younger doctors, he tries to figure out a correct diagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, he also must deal with patients that he is forced to see in the hospital's walk-in clinic. As noted, Laurie's performance is very good; the early talk about an Emmy nomination for him is quite justified. The rest of the cast is also good, though the scripts have yet to fully examine each character. (Viewers may remember Omar Epps from his earlier medical role as the ill-fated Gant on \"ER\".) The stories, while set up as brain-teasers, are also refreshingly complex about the doctors, the patients and the hospital; they don't resort to the done-to-death \"HMO's are the source of all evil\" plot line. These doctors are brilliant, but not perfect; mistakes are made. In the end, I hope that Fox will allow the show to continue. It's good to see an interesting medical show on TV, now that \"ER\" has degenerated into a \"tragedy of the week\" soap opera. And, as for Hugh Laurie's accent, I've heard better, but I've heard a lot worse. Give him time. (In a recent episode, he got to use his native English accent for a joke.) One important note: \"House\" is not for the squeamish. There are some pretty graphic and disturbing scenes in the series that some viewers may find upsetting. (For example, one episode featured critically ill infants and pulled very few punches.)",

And it happened to be the Season 6 finale (titled \"Help Me\"). Going to be honest, it blew me away. I did not know what was happening to the characters at the point in the story, but the acting was fantastic. The atmosphere was superb. The complexity of Dr. Gregory House intrigued me. I saw him as a tragic hero (something you find in works of literature) and his tragic flaw was his leg. Not only the physical limitations brought on by his leg, but the mental ones as well. The pain he suffers day by day that lead him to be the man he is. You see House as an ass...but you feel for him, because you know why he's an ass. Also, Hugh Laurie does such a good job with his accent, if I had not watched \"A Bit of Fry and Laurie\", I probably never would have guessed Hugh was British.\"House\" is like a beautiful novel. It has its themes from episode to episode, and it has its overall themes as a television show. It is a work of art, and I hate that so many dismiss it because of its premise in a hospital.

You want him to be happy, but you also can't help but feel like he deserves some of the things he goes through.The thing that impressed me the most about House is the fact that House stays House from the first episode of season one to the last one of season eight. His personality doesn't waiver for one second, and that's a feat in and of itself.While all of the medical jargon wasn't necessarily accurate and they had a habit of people coughing up blood in almost every episode, I did find it far more fascinating than any of the crime dramas that pop up. That might just be my personal opinion. It did get old the last couple of seasons though. \"It's lupus!\"Probably the best part of the whole show was House and Wilson's relationship. All of my favorite moments surround their crazy shenanigans. Like the chickens. Ah, the chickens...The worst part is when it's over. You are depressed for a few days.

He is a good doctor because he takes drugs. He's a good doctor because he solves the problems he doesn't really want to deal with. He's a good doctor because he bucks authority. He's a good doctor because the nurses respect him, his staff respects him. No, this is just a typical hospital story set in some land where doctors only care about making themselves look good in their own eyes.If the TV networks think they have created a true representation of the medical community in which there was a doctor like this one he would be on the street or better yet in jail, wasting their life telling everyone how good he was. Would someone really want to be treated by someone taking drugs to reduce their personal pain, not caring about the one thing they have promised to do. Would you want to trust someone who takes drugs on film for a living. Yes, that is what the networks think we want to see. The TV network wants us to think this is somehow real.I would rather be treated by Marcus Welby from the 1970's with no advanced technology than by a truly uncaring and totally disconnected person. I lost my father to a physican who felt that technology was better than feelings and carings. A physican that did not listen to my father. Maybe this will help someone else deal with their loss, but this is a Television medical show is turly lacking in any type of moral responisibily. I myself was mistreated for a condition by a doctor who did not want to take the time to perform any tests because of HMO issues.I do understand that the actor portraying Dr. House is well paid (in excess of $50,000 per episode) to act in this manner and this is not a reflection on his moral standards, but it is a reflection on what he is willing to do for money. I would just like for the TV show to end in a real manner, with Dr. House and the entire staff being arrested and put in jail for life for the loss of their patients.

Of course this is Fox, so the head guy is white and orders his \"team\" around like a potato farmer on his serfs in a dacha circa 1450. He says inappropriate things constantly, he wears his wizened cynicism as a badge of his brilliance (he knows more than we) and his gaze has the authority of a weather vane (his profile is extremely reminiscent of a chicken). Where does this all lead? Nowhere, of course. Fox gets to float a show that is perfect for the seals who lap up their 'news'; this is Bill O'Reilly as a doctor (woops, that's an unintentionally scary image).

Their adventures, that make up creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone's animated comedy \"South Park\", include fending off everything from supernatural demons to the biggest names in the Hollywood intelligentsia. \"South Park\" is several things. It's rude, crude, shocking, smart, decidedly adult, completely original, and it is indulgent in the whims and imaginations of it's creators. It's also the very best political, pop culture and current event satire on television.The show started as something of a fad - the new vulgar, don't-let-the-kids-watch show on the block. But as real world events changed, \"Park\" evolved along with them. Standing as the kings on top of a soap box they constructed out of swearing kids, talking poo, homosexual hand puppets and hermaphroditic parents; Parker and Stone where blessed with the freedom of a hit series, hip status and a network that gave them the freedom to do whatever they want. As the show aged, they matured in their storytelling abilities and the show went from shock value fad to a barbed satire of American culture.\"Park\" is brought to life with oddly beautiful, vibrantly colored 2-dimensional cut-and-paste animation. The episodes are masterfully constructed. The writing a witty showcase of Parker and Stone's love for pop culture parody, graphic violence, pornography and a bold willingness to take on the hot button issues of the week. It is a free-for-all virtuoso where nothing and nobody is safe, every establishment media position gets flipped on it's head and every politically correct sacred cow gets eviscerated. Now that's comedy - if you can stomach a barrage of extreme scatological humor with your social satire. The vomit jokes and fat jokes on \"Park\" aren't there for the sake of it, but have substance behind them. And nobody does them better.Eric Cartman, Mr. Garrison and more recently Randy Marsh (stepping up as a reliably hilarious scene-stealer) are classic characters, but Parker and Stone have gone further and developed an entire town of colorful caricatures. They aren't made to be as endearing as those in \"The Simpsons\", but aren't supposed to be. The characters aren't just vacuous idiots, and the laughs of the show come from a very socially conscious place.Straight men Stan and Kyle are the show's most underdeveloped. They serve mostly as a mouthpiece for Parker and Stone's conservative libertarian philosophy, often literally giving a speech to a crowd in the show's finale. There is not a single other place on TV where you can see environmentalists, the anti-smoking lobby, illegal immigrants, trial lawyers, news media hysteria, elitist Hollywood liberals, abortion, sex ed in schools and every celebrity from Mel Gibson to Paris Hilton all get ripped to shreds. The show pulls it off because it has a unique ability to deconstruct and reconstruct current events better than anyone else (notably Comedy Central's overrated \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\"), giving them a hilarious or supernatural explanation without moralizing getting in the way of the laughs. They take their own messages to such loony extremes it's impossible to take seriously.The cherry on top is the seemingly endless quality of the original songs provided by the creator's cover band, DVDA.With a skeleton crew that writes, directs, animates, voices and scores the show, this is independent television in it's purest form. This means it often labors on Parker and Stone's geeky indulgences - episodes center around a full-length \"Star Wars\" parody, the class gerbil making it's way up a human bowel or Timmy, a handicapped student who can only say his name. Occasionally, their shock value execution creates a gagging reaction that obscures an otherwise brilliant point (\"Fat Camp\"). But I'd rather have a show that challenges me than one shackled to clichés and network mandates. When \"South Park\" goes for the shocking ending, you better believe it actually will shock.Still, \"South Park\" is almost impossible to recommend in a casual sense. The show is truly an acquired taste, but one I have to come to support whole-heartedly through the years despite (and because) I have absolutely no idea what to expect when sitting down for a new episode. How rare is that? Where so many other shows cower in the corner, begging for our approval \"South Park\" is constantly taking risks and re-inventing itself. We've got terrific stunt episodes, episodes built around one joke or building to a single knock-out punch line. They use the smash-cut ending better than anyone (\"There Goes the Neighborhood\"). Sometimes the experiments are to it's own detriment and the episode is a 22 minute bore, but even then it's almost unheard of to find a show in it's 10th season that is still water cooler television.\"South Park\" grabs us by the collar, shakes us around and dares even it's biggest fans to come back next week for more. The show is a monument of creative freedom with a wicked imagination, a true (and hilariously funny) sense of comic timing, and an insightful, socially conscious ear that smartly reflects a point of view starving for attention in mainstream television. It is a hugely entertaining, fiercely visceral, fire-breathing, red-blooded American satire made by, for (and most appreciated by) the most jaded and discriminating TV viewers. We just don't have shows like this on TV today. Anywhere.* * * * * / 5",

South Park is an intelligent, humorous and thought-provoking show that is often ignored or decried by people who judge it only by the very things it deliberately throws in their face, such as profanity, simple animation, and graphic violence, because the creators know that people like this are easily offended by these things, and will always miss the point. The simplicity of the animation, for example, has been criticised by people who miss the point that it's deliberately meant to be simple, in the face of those high-budget major studio cartoons that are more concerned with using cgi and selling toys than having anything to say. Nope, this isn't a show for those who don't appreciate irony. The episodes tackle a wide range of issues, from 9/11 to violence on television to celebrity obsession to religion, through the use of comedy, which is usually the best way to handle such matters.The main characters are four children who are basically mouthpieces for their creator's opinions, expressing views that would sound arrogant coming from adults. Stan represents the liberal viewpoint, as does his friend Kyle, who as a practising Jew, allows opportunity for religious comment. Is the show anti-religious? No, but fundamentalists like to think it is. It has the essential message of 'believe what you like, but leave me alone'. And of course there's Eric Cartman, the ignorant foul-mouthed selfish redneck, and funny as hell. Sometimes I think he's there to remind us not to take anyone like him seriously. That and to provide a lot of the show's humour. Easily my favourite character. Other characters on the show usually represent majority/opposing views as the plot requires.Like any long-running show, some episodes are better than others, not all have something to say, and not all are funny. But creators Stone and Parker 'retool' the show periodically with new characters, and try to keep up with current events, and I enjoyed the latest series (8th) for these very reasons. I've watched since the beginning, but they're making an effort not to let South Park go stale.No doubt South Park will continue to be derided by those who think the most important social problem today is swearing, yet have probably never sat down to watch an episode. And beside them will be the offended parent brigade who still haven't learned that not all cartoons are for children. But the rest of us will still be here to enjoy it, hopefully exchanging righteous indignation for a few laughs and maybe a thought or two about the world we live in.

As of now, it is one of the highest rated shows on IMDb and was a huge ratings success when first aired, and no wonder. At its best, it's absolutely brilliant and one of the best and funniest shows there is to me. Thought that would never be said about a show known for dividing people with its controversial and \"offensive\" content, was not sure whether I would like it let alone love it and it ended up a favourite. Is it as good as it was? No, it's not as witty, daring or inventive now, but is still very funny and intelligent. That is only being said though because the earlier seasons are so good.To me, 'South Park' is much better than other popular shows like 'The Simpsons' (originally fantastic, now has declined rapidly) and 'Family Guy' and Seth Macfarlane's other shows, which never did anything for me.Can actually see though why some dislike it. A lot of the content is very controversial and not for the easily offended. The show is crude, extremely rude (possibly the rudest animated show ever), naughty, at times juvenile and less than subtle in its treatment of taboo subjects. At the same time, 'South Park' is hilarious, smart, witty and daring but also clever, sharp, irreverent and intelligent. The satirical humour is subversive and there are not many animated shows this daring, completely contradicting the tired and incredibly annoying cliché spouted constantly that animation is only for children (often by parents defending a panned family film).Often one is shocked at how much 'South Park' gets away with, everything. Every subject and every everyday issues is covered and satirised it seems, nothing escapes the writers. While subtlety completely goes out the window, so much of what 'South Park' says has a huge amount of truth and relevance (both when it first aired and still very much so now). Like good satire should it does it in a daring and perhaps divisive fashion, not holding back and taking no prisoners. This should sound like a recipe for disaster, but actually to me it was why the show is so loved and admired.There's more to 'South Park' than just the humour. The stories are very inventive, smartly constructed, cohesive, honest and relevant. The characters are some of the most memorable and iconic in recent animation, especially Cartman. Trey Parker and Matt Stone's voice work is a practical tour-De-force for both, both bringing so much individuality and personality to these characters and their writing.Not everybody seems to like the animation, personally liked the quirkiness of it myself and there are not many shows with visuals like 'South Park's'. The music is energetic and catchy.Overall, brilliant show that surprisingly became right up my street, even with the controversial content. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review": "Now listen, i'm giving this show a 9 because the previous seasons before season 19 were excellent. They really influenced many other hilarious shows, and part of the fun of my childhood was tuning in to South Park when my parents were gone, only to be caught watching it. But the thing that keeps me from giving this show a perfect 10 is because i think the show has changed for the worst.So like i said first 18 seasons of South Park we're excellent, even the bad episodes in there still had great memorable moments. I tuned in to Season 19 and i noticed they wanted to do a story season were everything is connected. But that season provided little laughs and the finale was disappointing. I had high hopes for Season 20 because i thought Trey and Matt (the show's creators) had listened to the feedback on Season 19, but Season 20 was even worse then the last one. Many characters went through unnecessary changes, they put so much political topics into the show to the point where it felt like overkill, they managed to make Gerald (Kyle's dad) the most unlikable character in the show, many things that the show sets up are quickly forgotten, and the ending was bad (not disappointing like season 19, but just bad). Season 21 was an improvement from Season 20 but the show was still missing something. And i think i know what killed South Park.It's no secret that South Park has many political and social commentary tones, but that was never the main point of the show, that was just a good addition to it. But it's like Matt and Trey forgot that, and they made the social commentary the MAIN point of the show.The sad thing about it is Trey and Matt really want to go back to the roots of South Park, but they forgot how to. They got so carried away with Politics that they forgot that the heart of the show was 4 foul mouthed kids in a small mountain town that find themselves in the dumbest of situations. They completely ditched that part of the show and i eagerly want it back.",

But, does it deserve a 10? \nWhen people who only watch Rick and Morty hear South Park, they think it's a very lazy and crude show (I will be ripping my friends' love for Rick and Morty to shreds). South park is actually the opposite, it is intelligent, funny and in some places heart warming and sad.\nThe characters are perfect, I love Cartman, Kenny, Stan, Butters, Randy and my personal favourite Kyle. The supporting cast are some of the most memorable characters, not as good as The Simpsons.\nThe episodes are some of the most memorable scenarios ever put on television. Hilarious episodes like the zip lining episode, unexpected episodes like the Christmas Critters episode, episodes exploiting people opinions and views on the world like \"Chinpokemon\" and \"Passion of the Jew\", very emotional episodes like \"You're getting old\" and my personal favourite episode \"Raisins\", very dark episodes like \"Scott Tenerman must die\" and the very important \"Osama Bin Laden has Farty Pants\". There's such a variety than Peter Griffin doing something stupid or a wacky Sci-Fi adventure with Rick and Morty.\nThe show has fallen. It's now a very boring show. But, instead of looking at the present, we have seasons 1-17 to rewatch. I have many respects to Stone and Parker for giving us a show that even my mother can love.",

By deliberately avoiding key political figures on one side of the spectrum, their selective approach to satire undermines their credibility as equal-opportunity critics.

The show now appears to be more geared towards children, albeit with some crude language and adult themes thrown in to maintain its TV-MA rating. To make matters worse, the show has taken on a didactic tone, attempting to impart life lessons in a heavy-handed and ultimately unsuccessful manner. In fact, it has now become so insipid that it can be compared unfavorably to even Peppa Pig, a children's cartoon. This is a sharp departure from its earlier seasons, when South Park was considered one of the best cartoons around and was a favorite of many. However, since the conclusion of season 18, it has rapidly devolved into one of the worst cartoons ever created.",

I was raised in a Christian home and had a great mother who taught me the ways to be a good honest person in life and not to be a foul mouthed moron like many others out there who have no life including those who created this show. not saying I'm Mr. Perfect by any means, but trying to live to the standards set by God the best to my ability. but at some point you have to open your eyes to the sick culture your in and give a critique of it. i mean look at how far we've come. we went from TV shows like \"i love Lucy\", genuine Christian based shows on national TV like \"little house on the prairie\", corny yet fun, child safe action shows from the 80's like Macgyver and A team. then in the 90's we saw just how much you can show on TV and just how much you can get away with on TV. faux kid looking shows like The Simpsons i never got into because it was the precursor to the crude nasty shows like south park and family guy, only a little bit lighter and not nearly as crude or offensive, though it did come close. but i still found it unsettling. then the big one, south park, that ushered in a whole generation of nasty, foul mouthed piggish kids and complete lack of morality. seeing absolute crap shows like this and looking back at the shows of yesteryear, its a sad, sad reminder of how far down the toilet bowl our culture has gone and even scarier about where its going. there is some sinister work being done in the media today to undermine God and common decency and have complete and utter chaos sweep our once great society. i hope people will wake up soon and realize what junk we have been feeding our culture for many years now and that we need a return to decency and morality on television, not to mention our society.",

This the perfect adaptation for the mass market who simply don't want to sit through one heavy, dark as hell feature, they want a recurring show, they want to get to know the characters.

The writers/ producers treat our law enforcement as dumb & dumber.

The operational director, Baz is just another steroid filled, no brainer. How could this kind of character lead any successful heist? Not mentioning the rest of the crew, a sociopath (schizophrenic), a drug addict, and another muscle guy with no positive attribute.The smartest character, a boy (Joshua) is so smart that he failed to find help (his teacher tried to help him, his girlfriend's family could help him etc).

The issues, plotlines and brilliant twists and turns are consistently unpredictable and original.Some of the heists stretch credulity - as action sequences often do, but the whole thing is so skillfully-woven that it doesn't matter - you happily buy into the lack of believability in the heist/action sequences, because they're so well integrated into the brilliant character studies and first-class storytelling.The casting is perfect - everyone is bringing their A-game but Shawn Hatosy is astonishing and Ellen Barkin is hitting a career best.It's a Breaking Bad-level achievement, possibly exceeding it at times.

No, this is much more a rather slow burner of a drama with only tidbits of crime and action thrown in almost as if an afterthought. The show doesn't build around the crimes and jobs the Cody's commit and so far every single one of them has been pretty underwhelming. The viewer is show the highlights of the job, and there is very little victory or celebration to be felt even after the most successful heists because too much happens off screen. The action here is best filed under how to make robbery boring. The heists themselves are pretty ingenious, but the execution is just rather meh look we got more money. Give me the money. No we have to clean it first. Gets a little old.Where Animal Kingdom gets it right, like other great crime-dramas of the past is that there are no heroes. Every character is shown, the good, bad, the ugly, warts and all. Character development and back story are pretty limited leaving the viewer at a loss most of the time. Even the family tree isn't fully painted to the point that there is no clear vision of who fits where or why. Even the relation between characters is not well defined. In a way, it adds more intrigue, but it can also make it hard to follow at first. The only real thing that can be said is that the Cody family are mostly made up of some pretty horrible people, all very deserving of whatever bad karma may be thrown at them next. It is difficult at times to find even a single person to root for here.Still the show does have many positives. It is filmed in beautiful Oceanside, California and there are great scenes of the Strand, the Oceanside Pier and other locations throughout the city. As former resident, I loved how the characters talk about how real estate is ruining the beachfront because that is a war that has been raging since the mid 1980s. Some great surfing and other water sport scenes are peppered in as well, and the characters love traveling on a whim to Baja, either winding up in TJ or a bit further down south with mixed results.At this point there have been some pretty good episodes, but also a lot of dull, slow episodes also. There is a hope that the show will reveal a little more each time, that I think is the main reason to keep watching here. Every time the Cody's do something dirty and you think you've seen their worst, you need to wait as they'll even do something more despicable later on. The reason to keep watching is the hope that this strange ride has a destination or a point somewhere.As many times as I've been tempted to shut it off, I plan to soldier on through season 4 and hopefully 5 with the rest of you out there. Though often unlikable there is something about these Cody's that is down right addictive. If I had to compare this to anything it would not be anywhere close to Point Break. No, this has much more in common with Shameless.",

It stars Christopher Meloni as Elliot Stabler, a tough-as-nails detective who makes his hatred of pedophiles and child molesters well known many times throughout the show. He has another side, a vicious side, that Criminal Intent's Robert Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) lacks. I'm very pleased that he's been nominated for an Emmy. Mariska Hargitay won an Emmy for her performance as Olivia Benson, another fantastic detective. Benson has more edge than CI's Alex Eames (Kathrine Erbe), but is revered for her ability to communicate to troubled witnesses and gouge confessions out of suspects. Her life is put in danger at least twice a season, yet she continues to be strong. Next is the sarcastic detective Jon Munch, played by the excellent comedian Richard Belzer. Munch may seem annoying at times, but his ability to relate to witnesses is excellent, and he plays the \"good cop, bad cop\" role very well. The final detective is Finn Tutuola, played by former rapper Ice-T. Ice-T plays the character reasonably well, but I think we'd all like to see a meaner side of him. He was very good in the episodes entitled \"Rage,\" and \"Rooftop\". They are led by Don Cragen, played by Dann Florek, and Cragen is as good a captain as any, as Florek reprises his role he held on \"Law & Order\" for a few years. Adam Beach recently joined the show, bringing something new to the table in youth and his almost 'surfer dude' approach to detective work. The ADA now is Casey Novak, played by Diane Neal, who could be better, but she gets the job done. She's been better of late, and the contrast between her and her predecessor is really helpful to the show. Her predecessor, Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) was great also. The team is also aided by an FBI psychiatrist, George Huang (BD Wong), who aids them in finding out the true horrors of a person, witness or suspect. His best performance was in the episode called \"Coerced.\" The members of this unit investigate sexually based crimes (rape, rape-homicide) and child based crimes (school shootings, child abuse, child molestation). The show has had extraordinary guest stars, from evil (Johnny Messner, Reg Flowers, Asio Highsmith, Jeff Kober) to touching (Leland Orser, Jerry Lewis) to lost (Brittany Snow) to famous and legendary actors (Jerry Lewis, Dean Cain, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Henry Winkler, Robin Williams, Matthew Modine, Alfred Molina, Cynthia Nixon, John Ritter). This is a truly great show that not only shows the line of work in this graphic department, but shows the emotional stress a detective goes through. 10/10",

I would watch it for time to time and it was an alright show but never really had anything jump out at me to make it one of my can't miss shows. Then this show came on. I watched this show when it premiered back in 1999 and was impressed from the get go. Sure it followed the basic premise of it's original cousin but was much more loose on it's format and execution. Some episodes hardly ever involve the court room at all where the original week in week out follows a distinct pattern. First half hour is the law then the next is the order. This show although does sometimes follow the same pattern like i mentioned it is much more loose in how it executes it. Mariska Hartigay is excellent as her portrayal of Det. Olivia Benson. The whole cast as a whole is magnificent. Now I know a lot of people will disagree with me that this show is in no way better than the original but for me it is. It has given me something that the original never did.",

            "review": "When I am communicating with other people interested in crime series it is remarkable how many people seem to watch either CSI or CSI: Miami or both. Rarely (actually never) have I heard talk about this show, unless I brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them. Of course I do not know the situation in America and other countries regarding this show, but I feel it is very underrated in the Netherlands. Of course this has a lot to do with it's programming spot. While CSI is usually on Saturday's at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. and CSI: Miami on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., SVU's spot has been Sunday's around 11p.m. for quite some time now. That's hardly what I call a prime time spot. Just to compare I looked up the share's of those 3 shows on the internet. CSI has a share of 26 in the US and 17,5 in the Netherlands. For CSI:Miami these numbers are 15,0 and 13,2 and for SVU they are 17,0 and 7,7. This doesn't mean much, but once bring the number of households into it, it gets a lot clearer. CSI has about 18,6 million viewers in the US while CSI:Miami and SVU have 10,5 and 11,9 viewers respectively. In the Netherlands these figures are 1,175 million; 910 thousand and 370 thousand. This means that SVU has less than one-third of the viewers CSI has and MUCH less than half the viewers CSI: Miami has. In America SVU has two-thirds of the viewers of CSI and about 10% more than CSI:Miami. In my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot SVU has gained in the Netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two CSI's, for I feel it cannot have anything to do with it's quality.The thing that makes SVU stand out so much in opinion, is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt. I personally appreciate it very much, that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music. Mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short. Maybe that's just another 'trick' to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera's. TO me though, it makes the stories appeal much more life-like and truly gut-wrenching and sad.Also all of the characters are good. If you watch long enough, you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them, thus discovering what makes them tick. I must admit that the series has changes it's emphasis a bit in recent years. In the first year there were numerous episode's that featured theme's or events from the investigator's home environment (especially Stabler's). This trend has somewhat diminished over the years, yet you can still see each individual's background shining through into their work ethics. One thin I really had to get used to was Richard Belzer's (Det. John Munch) role getting smaller. It seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks, something I really enjoyed. But overall the series has not changed for the worse, for I feel it has actually improved. While a few years ago I'd given this series an 8 out of 10 I'm much more inclined now to rate it even higher. What I've come to appreciate these last 2 or three years, were the additions of Ice-T (Det. Fin Tutuola), B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang) and Stephanie March (A.D.A. Alex Cabbot) to the team. Stephanie March's character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the D.A's job is, but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice. Huang's intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone (up until now). Not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight, but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media's depiction of profilers in The Silence of the Lambs or the TV-series Profiler. Also I think it is good (in addition to being very interesting) to show the public that not every offender is purely bad, but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface. As for Ice-T's character, I think he really completes the mix in the show, as the tough street cop. Him and Belzer are an ideal couple, just like Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni).The reasons, I personally feel SVU is the best crime series on the tube at the moment, are easily summarized. It has very much diversity, it offers insight into the psyche's of both victim's and perpetrators and it is realistic in every aspect.9 out of 10",

I understand keeping with the times but its a law and order show, none of that stuff needs to be in it. Show some sort of rape/abuse etc and then the investigation and court proceedings like you have been doing since 1999, why bring all this alt left, alt right bs into now???

            "review": "Around 2000, Law & Order had become one of the longest-running television shows based on a fictional premise, although it still has a long way to go in order to catch up with the record holders. Such was the continued popularity of the series that creator Dick Wolf saw a market for a spin-off, and was obviously glad to oblige. Hence, over ten years after Law & Order burst onto the airwaves, Special Victims Unit was born, so to speak.Of course, the show had a little problem finding its feet at first. This is only natural, even for a series spun off from a successful formula. The challenges Special Victims Unit faced included a major deviation from the normal Law & Order structure. The segment dealing with the trials of suspects was dispensed with, emphasising for the most part the efforts of the detectives to bring victims a sense of justice. As the series progressed, work with a District Attorney began to find its way into the plots, but in a manner more complementary to the work of the detectives.As in any series, the key ingredient is finding sympathetic leads that the audience can relate to. Where the original Law & Order eventually found solid ground in the form of Jerry Orbach, Special Victims Unit more or less got this element right from the start. Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni play so well off one another that it is certainly going to make life difficult for the unlucky actors who get to replace them. Another side benefit of the reduction in emphasis on the legal dealings is that we get to see more of the personal lives of the detectives, without them necessarily having to be worked into the plot. Every now and again, insight into the impact the job has on Stabler's family life in particular is offered, and it works wonderfully.The fundamental weakness in Special Victims Unit to date has been the supporting cast. Richard Belzer's schtick can get tiring, but adds the ironic comic touch (delivered so brilliantly by Orbach in the original series), which Meloni seems incapable of delivering. One has to wonder, however, whose bright idea it was to cast Ice-T as a replacement for one of the early detectives, as no matter how hard he tries to sound the part, one cannot believe him as a detective. Especially not one in this particular squad. The relative underdevelopment of most of the support characters does not help.Another challenge faced with every episode of Law & Order in any form is to come up with cases interesting enough to grab the attention. The original series is faltering slightly on this score, but when it does succeed, it succeeds enough to more than make up for all the average stories. Special Victims Unit, on the other hand, sets a consistent level for each episode. Because of the extreme nature of the crimes being investigated, they each become alike for the most part. It is the little details that make the big difference. This is, of course, a much better deal than the other spin-off, where the stories are consistent in how uninteresting they are.In all, Special Victims Unit is a well worthy follow-up to the original Law & Order. It is not recommended for sensitive viewers, but as an insight into the lot of those who have to clean up the mess in one of the modern world's most sexually violent societies, it works brilliantly. It even has potential to get better.",

In my classes, I've heard about the Down-Low phenomenon amongst black males in the U.S. This is the first show, aside from Oprah, that dealt with this issue. I was amazed and pleased that they'll take on any topic within their framework. Their guest cast should be praised as well. They have a great casting director. I don't know about their history with Emmy nominations, but they should definitely be in the running. The show has a very easy going nature despite the hardness of the cast that works well and acted beautifully.  It gives a real look at society's imperfections and discriminatory ideologies.

            "review": "Although this started out as a promising show, a better title for what it quickly became would be \"Law & Order: Liberal Lecture Hour\". Each episode of the show is a transparent allegory or a direct presentation of some liberal crusade in which the dialogue completely focuses on the detectives, lawyers, clerks, victims, and random passers-by reciting some left-wing diatribe. At first they had the decency to at least include a cardboard cut-out of a figure to respond to these arguments. Now they don't even bother with that; it's a straight lecture, complete with occasional raps on the knuckles with a ruler for not caring as much as these fictional characters obviously do.Many times the stories won't even involve 'special victims'. The writer might throw in some crime that at first appears to be under their jurisdiction, but this will quickly be discovered to be false. Yet the detectives just care so much (and so should you!) about the tenuously tangential political/social issue that they are compelled to make it their crusade. And laughably they are always able to secure some meaningless, fictional victory over it by the end of the show.If that's not enough to drive you away, there's one other major problem with this series: the completely overbearing and ridiculous way the show worships Mariska Hargitay. Not only is her character completely preposterous - she has, in turn, been a cop, a detective, a computer crimes investigator/hacker, an undercover agent with the FBI (while making sure not to insult the hippies she's spying on, and making a point about police brutality), and so on - but also has an overbearing, sanctimonious back story and has to be told she's \"beautiful\" every third show. It becomes really preposterous when she decides to take one of her many vacations; while she's gone the show does nothing but mourn her absence, complete with shoulders-up close-up static scenes of her randomly inserted into stories so we won't go into deep withdrawal.Chris Meloni doesn't fare very well in a role that has been almost entirely phased out. He was originally the 'muscle', but left-wingers don't like muscle, so now he's morphed into kind of a touchy-feely, whiny crybaby who pines for his cardboard cut-out of a wife and family and apparently feels bad for being the necessary tough guy. His role is unintentionally hilarious because the makers of the show have no idea what to do with him. They want a tough guy so people who like cop shows will watch (because enforcing the law requires tough guys), but if they make him too tough they'll lose the left-wing audience who likes the sermons and thinks violence is icky. So one show he'll punch a guy, and the next show he's in therapy for it. There's an episode where he takes down a combative perp using a choke hold - the only action sequence in the show - and is then castigated for the rest of the episode for 'excessive force'. On the ridiculous 'Abu Ghraib' episode they had him utter the completely laughable lie that he had \"used force\" to compel a confession, but \"9 times out of 10 is was counterproductive\". Makes one long for the halcyon days of Andy Sipowicz.The rest of the cast are increasingly irrelevant, pencil-sketch background characters. Though there have been abortive attempts to flesh some of them out, they're almost entirely ignored except to occasionally throw in a line representing their one dimension of characterization. Is there a pimp in this story? Bring in Ice-T! Does anybody use the word 'conspiracy' in this one? Bring in Belzer! And there's usually not much courtroom drama in an episode - the cops generally browbeat the audience for at least 45 minutes, minus the occasional chase scene - so we generally only see the pretty ADA give her speech. Which always reflects the lecture we've been given all episode and comes to the obvious conclusion: everybody who doesn't agree with the left-wing point of view on the issue is evil and should be in prison. But not executed! They're against that.So basically if you want to worship at the temple of Hargitay, believe everything sent to you in an email by MoveOn.org and love the Daily Show, and think the best entertainment is to hear your own opinion regurgitated to you based upon the latest opinion poll, this is your show. If you think Hargitay looks a little mannish, actually want to see a good cops/lawyers show, or find trite presentations of important issues tiresome, there's better to be found.",

You have a winner. Glad they have these into green light already. Of course Gary Oldman is perfect, but no one else has missed a beat either. Budget is movie quality. Writing is top notch. It deserves a nine easily but this is what we can expect from anything that says anything about anything in our world today. I'm just thankful for a show that has an opinion without compromising story or making me feel like I'm an idiot if I disagree.",

Another well-realised show that creates its immediate world with details of environment, character (and subterfuge) - the indispensable building blocks of good story telling.If you're just coming upon this show now that season 2 is released you should do yourself a favour and binge season 1 first - it's a good yarn and will offer a depth of character and situation that will add to your enjoymentSeason 2 appears to have lifted the game in terms of production design and cinematography - it's really paid off and elevated the show above the usual weekly episodic grind TV.Highly recommended - Oldman and Kristin Scott-Thomas are terrific, as are Jack Lowden and Saskia Reeves.",

Oldman has been so great in so many movies/shows that it's hard to keep track but this is absolutely one of his best performances yet! I have to admit that the first 2 episodes started a little slow and it was hard to get into but by the end of episode 2 it really picks up and from there on out it will keep you entertained and guessing what's going to happen next! It's already been renewed for another 3 seasons (through season 4) which is pretty much unheard of so that right there should tell you how good this show is.

Doesn't matter if the script is bad, or the plot is off, Gary delivers, always has, always will. Or did we just turn the tide on that one?This series starts off OK, the mystery keeps the plot going through the first two episodes. The tension is there, and you are a bit on the edge of your seat wondering where this is going. But then, half way past episode 3, you really start to notice that this plot is absolutely improbable.When i was done with episode 4, i was shaking my head in disbelief, and after episode 5 i was almost puking. This show makes every mistake known to man, except actually putting \"academy award winner Gary Oldman\" on the poster.The script is terrible, the characters are stereotypical, the plot completely off rails, the story is predictable and lazy, the editing is uninspired, the directing is completely by the book.By episode 5, Oldman is trying his best to keep his character plausible and relevant in this rather impossible plot, but you can clearly see he isn't up for the task, and that's saying something, when we are talking about one of the greatest character actors that has ever lived.I really wished this show was great, but instead it's simply bad. Two first episodes felt like a 7/10, it wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either, it was good, and i hoped it with start to climb as the plot thickened. But instead it all falls apart and goes downhill with impossible plot twists, bad writing, countless clichés , and the show just tumbles over the edge and gains momentum into the abyss.The writers of this show thought that creating an endless amount of coincidences could make their story plausible, they were wrong.3/10 - Bad.",

Long story short, this kind of entertainment is a form of MK ultra; seeping into people's consciousness through the back door, creating the kind of 'woke' mentality that got us into trouble in the first place. It's kinda predictable. Also, why do all cut out racist's have bitter working class accents when most if not all are minted masons. We know it's all inverted though right!? Truly, although Oldman (who is owned) owns this; it presents a patronising tone that assumes people believe whatever they are told - one word and your a racist!

It really jumped the shark later when it completely inverted the current political reality in the UK.I get it. It's fiction. But when a show is presented to me as a realistic depiction of reality only to then wildly deviate from reality, I can't help it pulling me out of the show. The series narrative makes as much sense as a show about the Mormons secretly being an international drug smuggling operation. Sure, it'll work, but I'd expect that show to be a comedy and not a serious series about the intelligence community.I'm just left with the impression the show is trying to inform my beliefs instead of entertain me.

The chemistry between the leads is nothing short of magical. Despite their age difference, they look so comfortable together that the screen almost forgets to separate fiction from reality.What makes this drama stand out is the effortless and natural connection the leads share. Their interactions feel genuine, filled with warmth and tenderness that go beyond scripted lines. Every smile, every glance, and every subtle gesture seems unforced, as if they were truly made for each other. It's the kind of chemistry that cannot be faked-it flows naturally, pulling the audience into their world.Episode 4 delivered what I can confidently call the best kiss I have ever seen in K-drama history. The scene was breathtakingly raw, capturing emotions that felt so real, I found myself wondering if I was watching the characters or witnessing the actors themselves caught in a genuine moment. The direction, camera work, and most importantly, the emotional depth of the leads, made this scene unforgettable. It wasn't just a kiss-it was an expression of unspoken love, vulnerability, and longing.Both actors deserve immense praise for how naturally they portray their roles. Their performances prove that true chemistry doesn't come from age similarity, but from trust, comfort, and emotional authenticity. Watching them together is a joy, and it leaves me wanting more with every episode.If anything, I only wish this series had more than 12 episodes-or even a second season-so we could continue to witness this beautiful story unfold.

Every past criticism of being a beautiful Kpop artist with sub par acting holds no water here: physical and verbal comedy are both carried out with aplomb. The Emperor proves to be a handy foil until he finally gets his teeth and even then we feel for the fact underneath he is still a bit perplexed.For those not familiar with Korean history it is true that a bit of the time period is confusing initially but as the 2nd episode progressed most was explained satisfactorily without causing the plot to drift sideways.We also are teased with just enough foreshadowing to have a glimpse of some of the mayhem on its way, and it looks to be delicious!There are tropes galore: a staple of kdrama. Well executed instead of cringe. Just because the kdrama favorite trope of time travel has again been utilized does not detract this time, thankfully.If they can keep the momentum up for all twelve episodes Bon Appetite Your Majesty is going to a majestic ride and we will be thrilled.The audience viewing numbers tell the tale even if one feels a singular review may be s suspect. The show picked up an impressive increase from Ep 1 to Ep 2 after the word of mouth circulated about the quality of the first episode.

Even without comparing it to The Office, it wasn't good or funny. I mean, that is in my top 10, while this might not even make my top 100. That's what she said.I was expecting the episode to be in the 20-minute range, but it was over 30 minutes, which wouldn't have been a problem if it was funny throughout. It was longer than expected, which was a shock. That's what she said.It felt like they just gathered all the information on how the paper industry works and showed it off, forgetting it was supposed to be a comedy show. And why is Oscar showing so much attitude? He was just a normal side character, and out of everyone, he's the one who returned. Now he's acting like he doesn't even want to be filmed. How does that make sense? If you don't want to do it, then don't come. That's what she said.I liked Domhnall in The Patient and Sabrina in The White Lotus, so I was excited to see them here, but they can't do much if the writing isn't funny. Other than them, Ramona (Nicole) was a standout. The others were okay but never exciting. That's what she said.To top it off, they're so confident they renewed it for a second season before even releasing the first episode. They're basically like, \"Let's do it again. Maybe next time will be better.\" That's what she said.In the American version of The Office, there was a very likeable boss, Michael, the annoying HR guy Toby, romantic tension between Jim and Pam, and the pranks Jim played on Dwight. All that stuff is still so memorable. Even after years, I'll never forget it. That's what she said.Honestly, I want to watch the remaining episodes because of the strong cast, but I don't think I'll be able to because of the writing. They released the whole season on the same date to let people watch it all before judging. Still, getting through it all would be tough. That's what she said.I'll be skipping it.",

Why not just make a new show?The color palette is ugly and dull, the acting ranges from bad to passable, the writing is pedestrian. The shoehorning in of the Miami metro characters (Masuka, Angel, LaGuerta) is just obnoxious fan service and ultimately is what makes it unwatchable for me. Honestly, I thought most of the supporting characters were generally pretty weak and unnecessary in the original series, so I find it particularly egregious that they appear in the prequel.I gave it a chance and watched the first 4 episodes and will not continue.

Part of Hall's original that was so good was that he was not at all imposing but yet was the most dangerous killer around. The young Dexter also seems like a doofus, whereas the older Dex seemed like a genius.But the main problem is that it's just boring. There is none of the tension and intrigue of the first series. Just the way it looked and was shot was very cool but this doesn't even look like Miami. It comes off as a low budget imitation.

So we're supposed to believe that Masuka worked at Miami Metro when Harry did? Plus what happened to Thomas Matthews? He wasn't even mentioned. The only decent acting job was by Sarah Michelle Gellar and she was in it for about 3 total minutes.

Dexter (seasons 1-8) is the only series I rewatch all the time.Like Harry (according to Dexter), change is not easy for me.So when Dexter: New Blood came out, at first the change of scenery, the cold, the absence of some beloved cast members and the lack of humour and latin music were a huge disappointment to me. However, after watching it as a standalone show (with no comparisons to the original), it grew on me.Now, with this new show, of course we're not used to the new faces in the cast. We all remember the young Dexter, Deb and Harry to look different, even Laura Moser.However, I think it may be unfair to judge the casting as we're not in the shoes of the casting directors and producers. I believe they had to consider many aspects besides just similar looks.Yes, we all wish that Michael C. Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, James Remar and the rest of the original cast could magically play the younger versions of their own characters, but time only goes one way. (Bonus: I really like Christian Slater. He's awesome as always!)So far, after watching the first episode twice, I like it. I think everyone did a pretty decent job filling in those big Dexter shoes.I cannot deny, actually, the fact that I'm now even more excited to watch Dexter: Resurrection after getting a glimpse of Dexter being revived in the emergency room.In short, I think this show is cool and will probably grow on me even more with time.If you're a Dexter fan, go in with no specific expectations or judgment.

They are caricatures of their original series counter parts, but they are there. You have Muppet Baby Masuka, Muppet Baby Batista, we are told to expect Muppet Baby LaGuerta. All look and act and behave exactly like the older versions of their characters from the original series, only younger. They dress the same. They act the same. Have the same mannerisms. As if they did not grow into the characters that we know and love.The prequel that I wanted, as a fan of the original series, was to see Harry DISCOVERING Dexter's \"dark passenger\", and how they need to keep that from Debra and how \"the code\" came to be. I wanted to see an adolescent Dexter navigating high school and growing into the man that we came to love from the original.And so the \"Muppet Babies\" gang really shouldn't have even been in the show, except for maybe some nostalgic nods via occasional guest appearances as coworkers of Harry who show up to pay fan service now and again.Instead, we get to see a reenactment of Dexter's first kill. Which we've already seen. That was in the original show, we didn't need to see it again.And where it leaves us at the end, tells us to expect that this show is going to be more of a \"reboot\" than a prequel. It's going to show Dexter in the Miami PD, with the same characters surrounding him as the original series.In other words, we can expect to see a show that we've basically already seen. The only difference is that Harry is still alive. But if you've seen the original, this is going to be exactly the same show only with the characters being slightly younger.

It seemed awkward. Its quite common for shows to take time to develop chemistry when the actors haven't defined their characters yet. The same can be said for the writers.However, I had never seen anything like it. In that regard it was dynamic and worth the time. The young actors soon found their roles and by the 5th episode I found myself thinking about the show every day.Now I cant stop watching. Im addicted. The actors are fantastic. The plots are far more developed. The supporting players play a big part in the series, and new characters keep rotating in flawlessly. The show has evolved .And just for the record, Im getting really sick and tired of people trashing the show because in their minds it doesn't measure up to the original. Its not supposed to be the original. If you don't like it, stick with the British show.",

            "review": "I was halfway through the American series before I even KNEW there was a British series. I think a was a little disappointed that we didn't create it, but I was also happy that it was one of the few shows that we copied without ruining it. When I checked some of the user reviews, I was surprised to see how many thought the show to be appalling. OK, not everyone will share my love for the show, but to rate it SO badly? But when I looked, the author of nearly every bad review was a fan of the original show. This simply sounds like a case of liking what you know. \"I don't care how good their cooking is. It ain't as good as my Mom's!\"Once I finished the American series, I gave it about a month to settle in and then started watching the British series. But I'd like to think that I was objective enough to judge it on its on merits, and not simply that it's different than what I'm used to.Since, as many have pointed out, the script is nearly word-for-word identical, the difference lies mainly in how the actors portray the characters.So I'm going to give my character-by-character head-to-head appraisal of UK vs. US. I'm going to use the character names rather than the actors' names for simplicity. Starting from the youngest...Little Debbie: UK wins this one hands down. No contest. She steals every scene she's in. Who can not fall in love with this girl???Carl: This one's close, but the UK one is (at least in the first season) a little more deranged and fun to watch.Ian: Another close one, but this goes to UK, too. US Ian is somber and good looking, but UK Ian always seems a bit panicky, and the wide-angle closeups of his face make him look pretty bizarre.Lip: This is solidly with the US. I like US Lip's darkness. He seems more responsible and intelligent. UK Lip is just kind of impish and unsure. You can depend on US Lip and he offers some of the only real family support to Fiona.Kevin: Dead heat.Veronica: Very different performances by each, but in the end, I like them the same.Fiona: This was a difficult one to call, but I'm giving it to the US. And this is probably because I saw them first. I just like her better. Hard to put my finger on the reason.Frank: Sorry, UK, but I just don't like your Frank. I understand the character is usually drunk, but he seems that way even before he starts drinking. He seems clinically stupid. US Frank (Macy) is equally as obnoxious, entitled, selfish and deluded, but he only seems drunk when he's drunk. At other times, his pontificating is fun to listen to. You feel good about hating the guy, because he's like this by choice. With UK Frank, you have to pity him. I feel like I'm laughing at someone who's mentally challenged.",

            "review": "I've grown up with the original Shameless. It's a fast paced Comedy-Drama like no other, in that it lends itself perfectly to both without apology or hesitation.Whereas the British original finds it's characters living, fornicating, screaming and jumping in the revelry of zero-expectation in a rigid class system, the American remake masterfully equivocates the triumphs and the tribulations of a lower class family existing on the edge of acceptability at the heart of society in a flawless, delicate and shameless manner.The pilot introduces the characters, much like their British counterparts, not in an effort to garner their sympathy but simply as a statement of fact. The aspiring teen marine struggling to hide his homosexuality only fears losing the love of his brother, the absent drunk dad who loves his children but through the haze becomes a heckling prophet - a Shakespearean fool who sees through the thin veil of sanity and order, a young woman struggling to keep the family together seeing a way out through a handsome highwayman. These people are not bad even if they do bad things. Society has forgot about them and for that they couldn't care less for it.The whole cast is tremendous but William H. Macy rises to the occasion with the father, a Frank Gallagher straight out of a bar in Memphis at 3 a.m. on a Wednesday, last orders, don't interrupt him because he hasn't finished yet, he's got to tell you what's wrong with the world before he wakes up and it all ends. You would believe this guy was a war vet or something with the confidence and delirium at which he pontificates.No matter what your race or background you can take something away from Shameless. Most television that likes to call itself Comedy, Drama, or both, tends towards a particular demographic, offering an escape fantasy for, say, the 'off-beat' teens in Glee or the sexually deviant young adults in True Blood or the repressed housewives in that show about the repressed housewives.As the designated guardian's new boyfriend takes a seat at the head of the table, he pushes Frank's legs aside as he crashes drunk on the floor. Shameless doesn't escape anything, it lives in the world it is given and every so often reminds you, during those joyously chaotic scenes, that the sweetest lemonade is almost bitter, so it's just as well every episode is only an hour for you to laugh, cry and enjoy.Moments of anarchic jubilation inter lap, run over and sometimes juxtapose flourishes of near-the-bone reality, served eloquently on a fresh platter to which America needs to to have the stomach for.",

In fact, it wasn't until the third ep that my eyes were opened. It's as if the actors have found their mark and the characters have come to life.While the ensemble cast is solid, and Macy is at his irascible best, it is the performance of three of the actors which makes Shameless something special. Emmy Rossum, as the 'adult' glue that holds the family together, has rightly received the most press. Her role requires a combination of strength, resolve, humour and vulnerability - qualities that would thwart a lesser actress. Rossum is able to convincingly bring it all together with fire and sexuality in addition to her other qualities.Equally effective in his role as the younger brother Lip, Jeremy Allen White brings a world-weary innocence to his character. Blessed with a malleable physiognomy, White is at once rascal and protector of the brood. White makes us want to know Lip better. That's rare.In a smaller role but probably my favourite is Emma Kenney as little sister Debbie. Her deadpan wisecracks supply the laugh-out-loud moments while her heartbreaking scenes of longing for parental love bring a tear to the eye of the most hardened soul. She can act toe-to-toe with Macy and still steal the scene.The rest of the cast is almost as good. Their performances would be wasted, however, without a tight script and fluid - but not frenetic - direction. The third episode brought all these pieces together in a fascinating show. Whether the writing and direction can sustain this level of quality over a season we don't know. What we do have for now is some of the best ensemble acting you will see on TV or on film.",

The first of the shows to premiere in the new year will be Showtime's version of the British award winning Shameless. Shameless follow Frank Gallagher, played by William H. Macy, and his not quite normal family. For instance the youngest of the Gallagher clan is quite obviously not Frank's yet that isn't even the family's biggest concern. Nor would it be the fact that in order to make ends meet and keep the electricity from being turned off all the kids chip in including the youngest daughter who takes up a collection that is supposed to be turned into Unicef. Yeah those are problems alright, but like I said they aren't the Gallagher's biggest problem. Their biggest problem would be Frank and his inability to stay sober long enough to pay more than his bar tab at the neighborhood pub.With that being said the first 21 minutes of Shameless doesn't detour much from the British version and that's OK. Instead of feeling as though I had seen it before (which I had) I just felt as though I was being introduced to a new slightly (overly) dysfunctional family. This was mostly in part to the cast who not only owned their roles they owned whatever scenes they were in and I don't say this lightly. Not once during the preview did I feel as though this was a family I was supposed to pity and feel bad for. This was a family I wanted to know and to hang out with. Luckily for me starting Sunday January 9, 2011 I get to hang out with the Gallagher family.",

It truly lived up to its name, providing cringe-worthy humor, and yet also seamlessly combining it with a meaningful drama that few other series have ever been able to pull off.This continues for the first few seasons, with the typical ups and downs, some story arcs of the characters being more interesting than others, which is expected in any series with as many memorable characters.Since the shift begin in the political climate, the series decided to shift in the same direction, and is suffering greatly because of it. What used to be apolitical, or rather distributing it evenly with good spirited humor, has turned the way of so many and simply become a new political cudgel. It takes quite obvious stances on political issues, and rams it down your throat, trying to make a message that was neither needed or asked for, and is not even in the spirit of comedy. It is simply there. Entire episodes and story arcs, that have no comedy in them whatsoever and are there simply trying to make a statement. The comedy that they do attempt with it is the nasty mean-spirited kind of \"humor\" that is not funny, but is simply insults without intelligence attempting to hide behind the mask of comedy.So unfortunately the series is going down hill at a break-neck pace, and likely nothing is going to save it now, especially with the loss of the central character.

The cigarette smoking was so excessive, I found it difficult to imagine how many packs of Marlboro's the cast went through. There were scenes with 11 year old kids lighting up. I wonder if Worker's Comp for lung cancer is in their future? Gross. Excessive. Sad. The chain smoking did nothing to contribute to the story line. It's as if the writers were trying to draw a thick, invisible line connecting low income, working class people with stupidity and smoking. Yes, it's stupid to smoke, but one has nothing to do with the other.You can be filthy rich and be a chain smoker. You can also be filthy rich and be stupid. One act does not require the other, yet the writers of Shameless obviously want viewers to connect those lines. They also expect us to connect with characters that are so incredibly unbelievable and colossally stupid. No amount of chain smoking or drug use could render an entire low income family that stupid.Shameless writers actually thought episodes filled with excessive profanity, full-frontal nudity (in EVERY episode), chain smoking, drug use, and violence would fill the massive holes in unbelievable story telling. It didn't work for me. Obviously it worked for some, but I am still waiting for the HUMOR.Please give me one episode with a shred of truth, a tiny touch of comedy and I may add another star.

            "review": "I've written about this show before on IMDb --- but here I am months later in May 2005 and yet it still continues to be impressive. There have been a few shows that were \"bleh\" in the last season but the \"SWAK\" episode tonight really got a few great moments of emotion between the cast members. The writers (at least to me) were able to pull off the \"suspended disbelief\" and I got pulled into the moment as DiNozzo was about to kick the bucket. I sure hope they keep most of the cast in the next season, as they seem to play off each other brilliantly. The only cast member I could see losing (according to the season finale preview, they lose an NCIS agent) is McGee. He's great and believable for his role, but any of the others lost as regulars on the show would break down the core character interplay. The McGee character could be replaced...but the others would be much more difficult. But then again I guess this is all decided and in the can...we'll find out on May 24th. My comments to other viewers that have commented on the reality of the series --- yeah, it's not the real life NCIS at all. But real life would be mind-numbingly boring to fit in 60 minute TV show. You'd need the constant buzz of fluorescent lights in the background combined with pages and pages of forms being typed into the computer --- mostly about drug abuses by young 18 year olds. This is TV drama and a fabricated fiction. I appreciate the nod Bellesario gives to NCIS and like the show for the entertainment it is. Real life NCIS isn't a fun job, but we get an hour on Tuesday night to pretend it is.",

Every episode begins with Gibbs saying \"We've got a dead Marine!\" and ends with the team stopping Al-Quada's latest plot to blow up Washington DC.If you can get around the obnoxious character and episode clichés then there is still the element of realism: real NCIS agents don't hunt terrorists in (US) city streets.

Almost everything about this show is cheesy, lame, repetitive and poorly thought out. The dialog is sub par at best. It seems like everyone likes the characters and I have not the slightest idea why. The only one one who is half decent is Dinozzo simply because he has no special character traits. Everyone else is a stereotype of a character that has been done to death in a million other shows. I just find that basically none of the characters interact well with one another. It is as if they took the main characters from their own shows and dropped them all together in NCIS. The result is that they are all too unique to create any kind of cohesion. Maybe once a show Dinozzo and Gibbs have a funny sequence of lines but every other time it is not funny and usually nonsensical, defying the way any humans would interact with each other. Not to mention countless instances of assault on the part of Gibbs towards his team, and the team in general towards suspects,terrorists etc. It all adds to the stupidity and unbelievability. So I guess I will continue tuning in because I am forced to... I wonder what the story will be next time? My money says that, wait let me guess, a member of the navy.... is murdered!!!!!

I'm also a huge fan of mysteries and I believe the best shows are the ones where you try and figure out who the villain is along with the main characters. Well, that doesn't happen here, because both arsonists are revealed by the end of episode 2. It takes all the fun out of the show.

The opening music sets the tone for the upcoming program. In this case, ouch. Seems the tone they want to set is one of slow, mournful, drudgery which lacks any excitement or sense of life itself. Basically depression in music form. I think they read the lyrics (read, not listened to) and failed to see the big picture for the title song.After watching the first 2 episodes.. yeah opening sequence setting the tone may be fitting. Drudgery.There's so, so, so much backstory for the detective (Smollett) in the first two episodes. Contrasted heavily by only one \"flashback\" of one setting for the fire investigator (Egerton). This striking difference did not go unnoticed.I won't include any spoilers, but the \"reveal\" at the end of episode two wasn't really as shocking as I think it was meant to be.There are aspects of the two main characters that just seem, well, B-movie-esk. Like they are so over-the-top, uhm, odd or ridiculous - for lack of a better phrase - that they just throw suspension of disbelief out the window at times.Not a great start.---------------------------Episode 3 confirmed my initial assessment... it's a \"nothing show\". Trying so hard to be \"deep and meaningful\" but it falls terribly short.Not watching any more. There's no point.-----------------------Broke down and watched the last of it.

I was rolling on the floor with laughter at the \"big reveal\" for the season (presumable series) finale. It was HILARIOUS that \"that\" was the thing producers/writers thought would be so stunning it'd wrap up everything well.Still ABSOLUTELY no backstory in all 9 episodes for the Fire Inspector (Edgerton).. none.. zero.. zilch... really.

This isn't just \"good\" - it's really, really, really good. It should be at least in the high 8s.Jurnee Smollett is effortlessly cool, magnetic, and somehow pulls you onto her side from the very first episode. She plays it with such quiet strength and instinct that you end up fully rooting for her, even when you're not sure you should be. It's subtle and confident work.Taron Egerton, on the other hand, is an absolute monster - and it's incredible. You hate him, but you can't stop watching. The performance is full of control, power, delusion, and pure ego - and it's real. It's so real, it's disgusting. And brilliant.But what makes Smoke shine is what it dares to explore: rejection, control, abandonment, shame, manipulation, the need to be seen, the chaos that comes when people with deep damage try to navigate power - it's all here. And it's not spoon-fed or sanitised. It hits hard.So why the low rating?I think it's this: people either live such boring, surface-level lives that they can't understand the complex emotional depth of the characters in this - or they think it's \"unrealistic\" because they've never had to confront real trauma, real darkness, or real survival instincts. Smoke doesn't hold your hand. It doesn't care if you don't get it. And clearly, some viewers just... didn't.If you're after another formulaic hero/villain arc or something \"easy,\" go elsewhere.

At times this looks like a parody of Dexter and might work well as a comedy, but unfortunately, this is not an attempt at comedy, this is simply a mediocre show.It's easy to predict who the villains in the show will be, they could have simply written on their foreheads, \"I'm a villain\".Deb is so irritating that it makes the series even more unbearable, and the other characters are parodies of what today's film industry thinks they should be.Michael C. Hall is always great in the role of Dexter, but he can't save this disaster either because the script is horrible. The dialogues are hilarious, a complete parody, at least I laughed a little. The characters may have been interesting, but they seem completely unrealistic, forced, and unnecessary. The cast is solid, but that doesn't mean anything because the script isn't good enough.One of the more hilarious parts of the show is \"the deer scene\", it really seemed like a parody with cheap CGI. Yes, it was not enough that the concept itself was a complete parody, even CGI was catastrophically bad.Too bad, I expected more, I liked the small town concept and the fact that Dexter would be in a winter setting this time around. Truly disappointing, but not surprising given the quality of most of today's film production.It could have been great, but in the end, this is just another disappointment.",

Dexter was always good at creating a fake persona that to other people appeared like a \"regular\" person, so it makes perfect sense that he has managed to blend in so easily. I have read several reviews saying that they hate Debra being Dexter's new guide and that every scene with her is uncomfortable, to me that's kinda the point. She symbolizes everything bad that has happened because of Dexter's darkness. \"Harry\" as a guide functioned as a reminder of the rules he was taught, he got Dexter to only kill bad people, but that's not the role \"Debra\" is intended to fill. You are supposed to find her presence unbearable because that's how Dexter feels too.Overall I think it will be a great season, the writing is good and the actors, especially Michael C.

The wife comes across as emotionally erratic, while the daughter seems to lack intellectual depth, making her contributions to the plot negligible. The daughter's portrayal feels particularly shallow, with her character offering little beyond surface-level engagement, which doesn't add value to the story.Moreover, having these characters constantly jump around in provocative clothing, seemingly for no purpose other than to attract views, feels out of sync with the tone of the series.

Sadly, it didn't, and ultimately, I walked away from Demon Slayer somewhat disappointed. This anime definitely had its good points; however, sloppy writing and hollow characters ended up bogging this anime down.Let's start with the good.The animation was stunning, and the soundtrack was great.Ufotable did an excellent job with the animation as usual. The fights flowed smoothly, with careful detail and excellent utilization of different shot types throughout different scenes. The color palate was diverse and vibrant, which benefited the character designs and certain scenes greatly. I didn't pay much attention to the soundtrack, but when I did notice, it reflected themes appropriately and often would amplify moods within different scenes.Additionally, the story is decent.Minus a few conveniences here and there, the story is well developed with a clear villain and end goal. The power structure is well constructed, and changes in powers are not easily attained.Where did it struggle though?Well firstly, the characters. Yeah, they're likable.... that's it. If that's enough for you then this gripe doesn't hold much weight, but if you fancy all-around well-written characters, I don't think you'll find them here. What you'll find instead are characters that seem to revolve around a certain trait/group of traits that define their character and leave no room for realistic depth.Tanjiro is a generic and 1-dimensional main character. Okay cool, his family died and his sister became a demon so he's searching to find a cure. Okay cool, he's compassionate and kind towards almost everyone. That's great and all, but those things still don't tell me enough about his personality and character; they never really further his character later either. It seems like the writer just wrote down a handful of good traits and said, \"Hey, that's good enough for a main character.\" They give him no real weaknesses other than his initial physical inferiority, which virtually makes him just as human as his demon sister. The fact that his character and actions throughout the story mostly revolve around other characters and events is a testament to how poorly established he is as a singular character.Zenitsu showed some promise during his initial introduction in the final selection arc and during the \"spider fight\" (I don't know what to call it) but ends up starting and finishing the same: a character for comedic relief, which would be fine if the satire in constantly screaming and complaining was actually funny to me.Inosuke is a loose cannon supporting character who doesn't have much to offer other than occasional comedic relief and utilization as another piece for fights.I really can't rip on Nezuko though; the writing mostly protects her character from criticism, and she's adorable.Speaking of the writing, it's not good. It's not awful, but it's not good. Honestly, it feels like this show was written for children. They constantly choose to tell instead of show or tell while showing. Nearly every action or emotion is either expressed through dialogue or inner monologue, which severely dampens the delivery of any emotional blow and makes the strong accompanying imagery practically superfluous.The dialogue also suffers severely from the lack of strong character foundation. It comes out awkward at times and mostly just serves to further the plot or to briefly check on the characters' states. The problem with the lack of revealing dialogue is the subsequent weak characters and character relationships. I can't even describe the primary character dynamics other than the words \"friendly\" and \"caring\"; there's nothing remotely notable about them other than maybe Inosuke calling Tanjiro \"Monjiro\" and Zenitsu's dependency on Tanjiro.In the end, Kimestsu no Yaiba succeeds on certain levels but also fails on others. I came in with expectations of a masterpiece but left with a feeling of pseudo-fulfillment. Maybe if I started with lower expectations I would have a more positive reception. Nonetheless, it still emerges at the top of its respective season of anime, and I would probably recommend it to friends if I wanted to introduce them to anime. 6/10 now please proceed to find this to be not helpful because you disagree with my opinion.TLDR: Great animation, nice music, cool fights, Interesting plot and setting. Flat characters, awful writing. Depending on how you weigh different aspects, you may enjoy this quite a bit. I recommend it.",

They need to do better with music editing. Some battles' epicness is taken away by the un-epicness of the background music.\n2. Too much internalization. I know internalization is part and parcel of animes but goddamn the main character just won't shut up for a second.\n3. Above all, the anime has a mediocre and typical storyline. The main character sets out on a quest to find the cure for his sister. To this end he must fight demons, which is basically like every other shounen anime ever. That's it. There's nothing else to the story. No depth. No complexity. To make up for the lackluster storyline, the author just includes some fanservicing scenes with cute adorable characters. If you're just looking for well-animated fighting sequences, this is the anime for you. If you are looking for animes that raise philosophical questions to make you ponder for days and days, look elsewhere.",

Many people only praise this anime for two things - the animation and Nezuko.\nAnd here is one bad part that is doing its best to ruin all enjoyment I get from this anime:humor. It's horrible. Not just it is horrible, but it is completely out of place that makes it really awkward. I intended to ignore/accept it as inevitable up until episode 11, but here anime went all in.

Now he is becoming a demon slayer to hunt the demon who murdered his family. For that he'll be part of an organization, called demon slayer corps, which a ranking system going from 1 to 10. On this journey he meet two other young demon slayer, which then accompaing him on his quest.Well, reading that you might see many pretty generic plotlines. Of course, that must not be bad per se. But the thing here is, that the characters are quite flat. Our young hero Tanjiro for example is really nice and friendly, thats it. He has no flaws, no errors. He has a tragic backstory, cries sometimes and must train more to become stronger... wow, never heard that before. Same goes for all the other characters and also for the world. Like the ranking system for the organization, it was just once mentioned. During the first season we only get to know members from the highest rank. What about all the other ranks? ( It would be like in One Piece during the first 100 episode we will only meet yonkos ). And to the style of the main characters: The main characters look so much out of place with the hair and the styling, compared to other people. And nobody is paying attention to that (not like in FMA were everybody is constantly looking at them)\nWhat really is amazing about the tv show is the animation and beautiful drawing. It is really top, watching the episode 19 season 1 was really amazing. Also the music is quite good. (But honestly, music and animation not as good as AOT - lets be real here).The tv show is okay to watch, it can be funny and interesting. Maybe younger audiences will love it more.

You soon bear witness to the fact that the only thing this has in common with other coach-team fairy tales is that they lose games and then start winning. But as Ted Lasso points out repeatedly in his home-spun wisdom, the games they play on the grass don't mean a fraction compared to the lives of the people affected.If ever people needed a heart-warming and life-affirming (yes, I said life-affirming, and I don't even know what that means) story, it would be in 2020. Ted Lasso doesn't have a cynical or sarcastic bone in his body, and viewers will very quickly be won over to his way of playing and living.I could have done without any of the jokes about how little he knows about football. Not many of them were funny and some were just annoying. Thankfully, these were few and evaporated quickly as the story got up on its own two legs and ran away from the original TV commercial gag.I just watched E07 last night and I couldn't even believe how badly I needed what Ted Lasso is selling. After a tough day reading the news, the show went down like good medicine. I've never had that experience from watching a TV show before. Can we have more, please? I hope this starts a trend towards this type of programming.Don't get me wrong, I love gangster movies and crime stories, but there are so very few stories out there telling us that we really need to treat each other better. I see movie posters on bus stops and almost every one of them has some guy-or guys-with a gun-or guns. There should be a law against peddling this trash in public.

I would also consider myself to have a great sense of humour, as well as a breadth and depth of knowledge about the history of comedy. I've laughed long and hard at everything from the Carry-on films, Python and Fawlty Towers in the 70s, Black Adder in the 80s, Father Ted in the 90s, and The Big Bang Theory....to name but a few. I have an enormous amount of respect for comedy writers. But this is dreadful, puerile, unfunny and deeply irritating nonsense. We are meant to laugh at the idea that the British like tea, for example. Any comedy writer with talent and imagination would dismiss this as having zero value - it is far, far too obvious. I sat through half an hour of this mediocrity without even smiling. No doubt there are countless other lame attempts at jokes but it isn't worth bothering remembering them.

The show is about a guy named Lincoln (Dominic Purcell) who gets arrested and framed for a crime that he didn't commit and now his brother, Michael (Wennworth Miller) installs himself in prison for one reason, to get his brother out of jail! FOX had better not cancel this one! Because I'm tired of the FOX network canceling all these other good shows that have potential and they put them on nights where they can't win and they have way too many reality shows! Plus all the good shows that FOX cancels last for 1 or 2 seasons like \"Tru Calling\", \"Dark Angel\", \"Fastlane\" just to name a few. But hopefully this show might last with all the good reviews from all the newspapers and magazines.User Rating: 10/10BOTTOM LINE: FOX SHOULD HOLD ON TO THIS ONE!",

I decided to give it a chance and watched the premier last night. Let me just say that I'm addicted to the show after the 2 hour premier. This show was great, the acting, the characters, the setting, everything was done top notch. The show is filmed in and around Chicago, the prison they use for the setting was just closed a couple of years ago, it gives it a very authentic look. If you thought like I did(how can you make an entire series out of one prison break?), give it a try, you won't be disappointed. Besides, Fox made an entire season out of a 24 hour period.",

            "review": "Prison Break is one of the best new series. It's got personality, style, thrills and action. Michael Scofield robs a bank only to be caught and jailed. With him behind the bars he brings a plan to get himself and his brother, who is sentenced to death, out. What few people knows is that Michael is the architect of the prison and so he knows his way around.The characters are really good. You really get to know them, but just so good that they're still unpredictable. You get to know some of their history and what kind of person they are. The actors does a great job in portraying these characters. I've only seen Dominic Purcell in John Doe, a performance I didn't find that good. However, in Prison Break his potential in shown. He portrays Lincoln Burrows very good. Wentworth Miller also does a great job as Lincoln's brother, Michael Scofield.The story may seem a little incredible and some facts may be wrong, but never the less it's made quite believable. You believe the locations and the characters and how they behave and react. The story is well written and detailed and it all seems possible. They've managed to give this series kind of it's own style and personality. The basic idea of escaping a prison is old and so you might not wanna call this show original. On the other hand you don't know what else to call it. It is a new twist to an old idea (and a good one I might add) and it is not filled with clichés. It gives a realistic image of what could very well be. At the same time you got the old hero who's out to save the innocent. Yet, Michael is not treated like a hero. He leans more towards being a anti-hero.The cinematography is great. This is one of those series with it's own unique look. The mood, style and action is well captured in really good looking shots followed by really nice music.If you should start to watch one new series this year, it should be Prison Break.",

Dominic Purcell is wonderful as his brother on the cusp of needing to believe his brother will help him. Peter Stormare is creepy as only he can be.

            "review": "If I were to rate the seasons individually, the first two seasons would have gotten a much higher rating. I really liked those, the suspense was held high, there was something at stake there. It really loses its grip (on almost everything) with the end of season 2, to make way for the third season. While watching Season 3, I realized this was more or less a rehash of the first season (though not as good). Still compared to what they went and did in Season 4 ... Season 3 seems like Shakespeare compared to it.Season 4 goes completely Telenovela on the viewer and while it could have been even more ridiculous, it was enough to almost make me rate the whole thing a 6 instead of a 7. But back to the good things. Season 1 and 2, with great characters and while still some peculiar coincidences, it was really suspenseful and did hold its own. You had some surprises but you also had some things to look forward too. The misdirections worked (the ones you spot and the ones you missed) and the acting was more than decent enough.Talking about acting, one particular character (a bad/psychotic one) seems to be a favorite. Especially with the ladies and it's not purely for his looks (no offense). Which made me wonder, especially considering the crimes that character committed, why some people were rooting for him. But that's just me I guess, the actor playing him, does a great job and later in the show there is a female \"counterpart\" (sort of).The show also got nominated for its score (and might have won a few awards) and rightfully so. The theme is really good and sets the tone. Even the advertising break interlude has a nice touch (of course watching it on Disc, you can avoid those). Everyone was making a big deal that this was a network show and not cable. So there is some violence and a bit of cursing, but not as much (and no nudity) as in other shows. But that was never a problem (at least not for my viewing pleasure).If you can stop at/after Season 2, you might do yourself a big favor.EDIT:\nOnto Season 5 then ... and as I predicted 6 years ago or so, became reality. Someone even has a season 6 locked in ... ah well. The latter might not happen, no matter how much quite a lot of fans want this to become reality. And I'm almost surprised no one has \"rated\" my review yet. Then again, there are over 700 - so there is that. But back to the \"final\" (?) season, which picks things up where we left them, but is way better than season 4 - ok that is not really difficult to achieve.Some things get negated and others (prison sentences) get \"explained\". Also, who cares about \"logic\", yes? Not a real hardcore fan of the show - they will not. So switch your mind off and try to enjoy this romp as much as possible. Luck and everything included - it flows almost exactly like you expect it to. With all the necessary/expected story beats. Nothing much should surprise you here ...",

            "review": "Prison Break is now on its third successful season and shows no sign of this wonderful drama ending. Prison Break has everything from petty crooks to government conspiracy to crooked cops. One could have never thought that you could make a show about breaking out of jail so entertaining, or could one? This show reminds me a lot of the ShawShank Redemption. I wonder if that movie inspired the writers at all? Even though they could have been inspired, this show is definitely unique. It all starts because Linc (Dominic Purcell) was falsely accused of killing the vice presidents brother, and is now sitting on death row. Linc's brother Michael (Wentworth Miller) robbed a bank so he could land himself in prison to help break his brother out. To do this Michael has the blueprints of his escape secretly tattooed all over his body.Now Michael has some pretty good luck, what are the odds that he was sent to the same prison that his older brother is at? I would have to agree with Gillian Flynn from Entertainment Weekly When he states, \"Let's pause, laugh, and salute this series for being so well shot and acted that these little dragonflies of illogic buzz us only briefly. (But seriously, how lucky for Michael that he was sent to this particular prison  otherwise we'd be watching him in Leavenworth hitting his head and muttering ''Stupidstupidstupid!'' for five years.)\" It is very convenient that he helped design this particular prison. What would he have done if his brother got transferred or if Michael was sent to a different prison, I bet he would have felt pretty stupid. I am also very impressed that not only does his full body tattoo look good, but it is a map of their escape. Another pretty amazing thing is that he can actually remember what everything means. I don't know about you but I think I might get some things mixed up.Putting aside the unlikely elements of this entire show, it is actually rather entertaining. It is very suspenseful and you never know what is going to happen next. Also people can somewhat relate with this show seeing how it is not exactly science fiction. Everybody knows that there are innocent people that are sent to prison, and even put on death row just like Linc in this show. So except for the \"government conspiracy\" for some people this show might hit at home, making it very entertaining.The acting in this show is done very well. I have not once said to myself wow he sucked. From the main characters all the way to the extras the acting has been superb especially on Michaels part. I think his best acting episode had to of been when he was pretending to be insane. I could have sworn that he was not faking his mental illness. Another character that stands out in my head that is a very good actor is Haywire. If I did not know better I would honestly believe that he was mentally insane. He plays this part perfectly and makes his scenes very entertaining.The graphics and the special effects in this show are not bad as well. From Michael being burned to Linc getting in the accident, it all looked pretty real. I never saw anything that looked really fake. I did see some things that were rather unlikely though. Like when T-Bag got his hand cut off and sewed back on. He was about to get caught so he ripped his hand off to get away. To me I think I might have passed out or at least have to go to a hospital afterwards, which he never did. He just put a fake hand on his arm like it was not going to get infected. Now even though this is a little for fetched it does make this wonderful drama a lot more exciting.One thing I noticed when I was watching this show is that there is no narrator. There is nobody telling you anything about the show. I think that this makes the show more exciting. It is like it adds more suspense to it. When you have a narrator he/she tells you wants going on and what to think. Two examples of dramas like this are Grey's Anatomy and Desperate House Wives. When you do not have one you have to think for yourself. Therefore your mind is racing with ideas of what is going to happen next.Even though this show has a few things that are very unlikely to happen, it has a lot of things that are very likely to happen. It has a lot of good qualities to it. It has good acting, graphics, and special effects. It has all the elements of a very entertaining television drama. I would have to say that this is a very good show and that I will continue to watch it.",

Seven years a lot can happen in the life of the real performers, but the true fans appreciate all the old-main characters back in the show and right now I can't be more excited to see the development of these show, especially the \"character work\" of the always magnificent, Robert Knepper(T-Bag). It's too early to tell if these TV show will be of the same quality as the first four seasons of Prison Break but I have high expectations on this sequel. The only band thing is the length of these season with only 9 episodes, when way back to 2005 the old Prison Break has more chapters in each season but at the same time is an advantage because the chapters, if the script is amazing, will be full action, drama and great performances. Can't wait to see more of one of the pioneers of the post-2000's boom TV show era.

The first four seasons, tears, emotion, etc, were kept at bay. That could have been on purpose because usually people with high intelligence are less emotional. But he has definitely improved and his acting has gotten better. The other actors are doing fine as well. Linc is just the same as before. A little tougher, rougher, bit still Linc. Critics are just that. Critics. Take everything said, good or bad, with a grain of salt.

            "review": "Looking at the IMDb reviews it seemed rather strange to me that most of them (the top ones at least) were quite outdated, written in 2005-2006 actually or the reviewers had not seen more than 50 or 100 episodes. Having said that please note that i have seen 610 episodes and 2 movies(strong world, film z) as of the day I'm writing this review. I hope my review will provide you with valuable insight to the series or even convince you to watch it. I will try to be as spoiler free as possible.It's been about a year since i started watching anime regularly and that is something I have yet to regret. I mostly enjoy short anime with less than 50 episodes that have good plot and well made characters, anime like cowboy bebop(my favorite), mushishi, ergo proxy, code geass etc. I knew about anime like OP, Naruto, Bleach even before I started watching anime but kept avoiding them even when I had seen about 50 (I must have seen over 100 now XD) other anime mainly because I thought to myself 'how can they be any good when they have that many episodes? Aren't they out of ideas yet?'. Well I might be right about Naruto and Bleach but when it comes to One Piece I couldn't be more wrong. One piece is so good, so enjoyable and it never ends which is something everyone who is watching it wants.Talk about long introduction huh? Anyways onto the actual review now. It will be divided into 4 sectors: story, characters, art and sound, enjoyment.STORY: Now the story at first might seem very simple and straightforward, a young boy Monkey D. Luffy (17 years old)setting out on sea on a great journey to become the Pirate King and find One Piece the biggest and greatest treasure in the OP world that was left in 'that' place by the former Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. Before Roger was executed publicly by the marines-world government he told everyone that if they wanted OP they had to look for it and that it was all left in 'that' place and that ignited the great age of pirates. The series is divided into arcs, each featuring its very own story and setting, each island, each place the straw hat pirates (Luffy and his crew) visit is a whole different adventure with new people to meet and new circumstances. And that's one of the best things of OP, you never get bored. You are fascinated by the huge and diverse OP world and you just can't let go of it. Everything is interesting and everything is fun, Luffy and his crew never chose the easy path but they strive for adventure and excitement and they almost pass their feelings to us the viewers. That's something very rare especially in anime and OP handles that expertly. Once you have seen enough episodes you will realize that the main characters of the series, especially Luffy, don't really care about their destination, hell most of the times they don't even know where they are going at all. All that matters is that they are going somewhere interesting where they will learn new things, get stronger, meet new people and face powerful foes. Another thing worth mentioning is that the series has very few fillers (episodes that did not exist in the original story-source material-manga) unlike some other mainstream anime series(Naruto, Bleach anyone?). Also the fillers are actually not that bad, sure they are not good but many of them are OK. And that's a huge plus for an anime series.CHARACTERS: This is where OP really shines. Each character is presented with great detail, they are all quite unique. Everyone has their own backstory explained thoroughly and we get to see why they are who they are, why each one of them has their very own ambitions and dreams. Due to their different experiences they have very different personalities and through good character development we see how they interact with each other and how they get closer to each other. We see how they become comrades and everyone is looking for each other, they become something very close to a family. That's the kind of bonds they make. Furthermore we not only see the history and personality of the straw hats but many others too like members of the marines. We see why they make the kind of choices they make. Nobody is entirely evil and nobody is purely good. Everyone has a good reason behind what they are doing and they strongly believe in their own cause, in their own justice and in their own dreams.ART AND SOUND: One Piece also excels in this sector with beautiful and vivid animation. The sceneries look alive and all different from each other with their very own characteristics. The characters are illustrated masterfully and each character looks a lot different from each other (that's a huge plus in anime). The sound department also did a great job especially with the voice actors, I'm always talking about the original Japanese (don't you dare see the English dub),who fit really well into their respective characters. The music, for me at least, is very catchy and actually really well made. However that depends on personal taste, if you are not really into this kind of karaoke-Japanese style of music you might not like it. Nevertheless OP really has some of the greatest music themes I have heard in an anime.OVERALL ENJOYMENT: One Piece is one of the most, if not the most enjoyable and diverse anime series you can find. It really excels in pretty much every field there is. It is the only anime series, or any series, I have seen with that many episodes and yet manages to stay that good(and believe me, have I seen a lot). I recommend OP to anyone with enough time and hunger for adventure. If you have not decided whether to watch it or not just watch 10 episodes and see for yourself if you want continue or not (oh you will want to continue). Trust me and you won't regret it, just like I did.And yep that's the end of it fellas. If you enjoyed my review and found it useful please upvote so others can see it.2021 update: I've been on the fence about deleting this since it's so poorly written, I was 17 at the time of writing and not a native speaker, and my opinion on one piece and anime in general has changed dramatically for the worse. But I figured I might as well leave it be since people seem to like it and it serves as a kind of snapshot of my 17 year old self whose input other hopeful 16 and 17 year adventurers out there might find helpful.",

Luffy will sure to succeed his goal in becoming the Greatest Pirate that ever lived.Comic made back in the late 90s, and the anime series has been around since the earlier days of SpongeBob. I first heard of it when it came on the FoxBox back in late 2004. I wasn't entirely into many anime back then. And I never saw the English Dub of the series, as I found it to be an OK series. After reading on the internet that the dub is heavily edited and nothing like the original. I grew interest on how good it is. I read the first volume of the Manga series. And liked how the story was going.Wasn't until January 2007, when I finally start to check out the Anime. Only I viewed the episodes that are subtitled, uncut, and uncensored. And I grew to love it. The animation is very well done, it's funny, it's action packed, and it's dramatic sometimes. I don't even consider it a kid's cartoon, when it's more aimed to teenagers. But with an interesting cast of characters, and over a hundred secondary/miscellaneous characters. One Piece is indeed a great Anime next to Case Closed, Naurto, & other ongoing series.The reason why it's very underrated was because of 4Kids being the first company to distribute the anime. Which they edited and censored a lot. And many flaws in the dubbing. Such as voices that don't suit the characters' personalities. Too many pirate accents and catch-phrases that get old instantly. All the violence, blood, alchol, drugs, and nudity were altered and removed. All the weapons were altered to look harmless. 4Kids spent more time edditting than spending time on the scripts. Plus a lot of filler and small episodes were removed. And most of them were too important to take out in the series.The good thing is 4kids no longer owns rights to One Piece. I knew they would drop it, because they did a poor job in introducing the series to English speaking countries.With over 300 episodes, I can tell that One Piece is really big in Japan. I've seen all the current episodes. And can't get enough of it.So those who like their Anime uncut, should highly recommend seeing One Piece uncut by fan subs or Funimation's release on the series.",

Well one day while watching Toonami in the UK i stumbled across show called one piece. It wasn't amazingly good, there were obvious problems with the dub, but it was enjoyable none the less. After i'd watched few episodes i started to become curious about the characters and the origins of the story. I did a little bit of research on the web and found out that the version of One Piece i was watching had been butchered from its original format. There were A lot of sources that all said the same thing, that the original One Piece was brilliant and that the dub was nothing in comparison. I liked the show and wanted to see what Uncut One Piece was like. After a little more searching i found some fantastic fansubs and my real One Piece experience started. What can i say, Japanese One Piece is one of the best stories ever told and is by far my favourite show to watch. I look forward everyweek to watching the next episode when the fansub is released. 280 episodes into the series and its still as great as it was when it first started.A poor dub led me to discover my favourite show, and so if nothing else, the dub will let new fans like me discover One Piece.Lets all hope this adventure continues for a long time.",

He taught me that if you decide to accomplish something, you should put everything on it and fight for your goal till the last moment of your life. This anime is awesome, hilarious, and touching. It brings me a lot of laughing from the funny parts, and tears from the touching moments (yes, I really did shatter my tears). It's really an awesome anime, I've been watching from episode 1 - 144 so far, and I never found even a second of the anime boring. I highly recommend every one to watch this excellence anime.",

Since I have watched Bleach and Naruto, I totally agreed that Bleach and Naruto were the best. But One Piece??? I was very doubtful at that time. Why? Because there's no way an anime that is childishly drawn could be at the same level as Bleach and Naruto. But my friend keep persuading me to watch One Piece and one fateful day, I tried to watch it continuously for one whole day. Oh my God!!! I was completely stunt! This anime is beyond my expectation. What an epic. For me, it was better than Bleach and Naruto. Luffy and the Strawhat Crews have their own unique characters that can be related to most of us in our daily life. The supporting characters and villains also have characteristics that will stuck in you mind for ages. I think that's why One Piece is the best. Most of us 'feel' for each of the characters in many ways...may it be in laughter, agony, suffering and so much more. Kudos to the One Piece's production team especially the amazing creator, Eiichiro Oda; for creating a world that is beyond ordinary but still can amuse ordinary people like me and you.A must see anime before you die...",

It has hilarious, roll on the floor from laughing humor and so much action it makes you wonder if the crew ever gets tired.But in its core, One Piece is about something else: it's about nakama. Nakama, a Japanese term generally referring to comrades, receives a completely new feeling in One Piece. Stand by your nakama, believe in them no matter what happens, no matter what anyone does or says about them. Help them in any situation, even if it means putting your own life on the line. With you nakama, you can do anything. And it is this extreme sense of comradry that makes you fall in love with the characters and wish you could be a part of the strange little group.It also teaches how humans are allowed to have flaws; in fact, all people do: seemingly perfect Swordsman and first mate Roronoa Zoro has no sense of direction whatsoever and can easily get himself lost on any one way street, navigator Nami is absolutely crazy for money, cook Sanji loses his mind once he sees a lady.. and the list goes on and on. But despite these flaws, they continue fighting. For each other and with each other. If one crewmember can't do it, somebody else will be right there for support.If you're looking for a funny, action-filled series whose main characters easily grow to your heart and feel like family: go for One Piece. You will not regret it!",

            "review": "It is difficult to sum up the story of a series with hundreds of episodes, TV specials and movies, so I'd rather just try to tell you what it is about and why it is so incredibly good.The series starts off with a guy named Luffy whose ultimate goal it is to become the one and only \"King of all Pirates\" and to find the greatest treasure in the world. The first episodes introduce him and some characters and make a lovely start that is entertaining and makes one want more. On his way Luffy meets a lot of very interesting characters who become his crew members and friends - each of them with an intense and captivating background story. Every character in this series - be it friend or foe - is either adorable, tragic, despicable or interesting at the least... no boring characters anywhere. Later on in the series, important events and story twists are often visualized or supported by huge appearances in the fabulous and unreal environments that our crew travels. This is perfectly done and helps the already epic feel of the story. I have seen 150 episodes, four movies and two specials so far and there were moments that made me cry, laugh, think and re-watch some episodes (especially 85-90) at least 30 times. You might come to the false conclusion of having a kids show here due to the presentation, but that is definitely wrong. People sometimes say about a movie or series that it is \"not a life changer, but entertaining\". That is definitely not the case here! I know it sounds nerdy, but this series has broadened my horizon in many ways and I recommend anyone to take the admittedly long time to get into this epic adventure. The best way to do so will be to watch the fan-subs which are as close to the original as a non Japanese will get (explanations of puns and traditions). There are of course some filler episodes in a huge project like this which won't blow you away, but that is only natural with hundreds of episodes and helps developing the characters. This show is an easy 10/10",

            "review": "One Piece was one of my favorite anime of all time until around episode 500. The various arcs with their stories and characters were highly enjoyable. The end of the Enies Lobby arc was the first time an anime actually made me cry and to this day whenever I go back to the scene that did that I still tear up. One Piece was just that good back then.Unfortunately the quality of the anime has dropped considerably from episode 500 onward. In the past when the anime was catching up usually Toei Animation produced a few filler episodes after they had finished a main arc. Even though some of these fillers were weaker than the main story episodes it allowed them to continue with a good pacing while producing episodes on a mostly weekly base.However the amount of content that was covered with each episode got more and more stretched out the further we got past episode 500. I can easily provide numbers for this as well.\nThe Enies Lobby arc had 56 chapters in the manga and was covered in 46 episodes. This means you had a bit more than 1 chapter per episode.\nThe Fish-Man Island arc was the first one to have more anime episodes (58) than manga chapters (56).\nThe Dress Rosa Saga (Punk Hazard and Dressrosa) had 172 episodes covering 148 manga chapters.\nThe Whole Cake Island arc had 95 episodes covering 78 chapters. This means we almost had 20 episodes within this arc with purely stretched out content and filler which dragged down the story as a whole because the build up to the fights and fights themselves got constantly stretched out. Toei also used basically any trick they could to accomplish that. The most lazy and obvious attempts at this I've seen was for example an episode where we saw a scene three times in the same episode. First the actual scene happened and then there were two flashbacks showing the exact same thing again within the same episode. This just destroys any good element you may have within the story.To make One Piece as good as it was the episode schedule would need to be changed so that they show sagas for about 6 months of the year while taking a break the other half of the year. Toei won't do that though as One Piece has been an important source of revenue for them for a pretty long time. And because of that the anime version of One Piece is basically ruined.I'd easily recommend One Piece until around Fish-Man island (8-9/10 rating). Everything afterwards gets a 2 or 3 out of 10. I finally dropped the anime at episode 904 even though I hadn't really gotten enjoyment out of it for quite a while.",

Roger which marks the beginning\nOf \"the great pirate era.\" While the marines fend off pirates in order to protect civilians with their own sense of justice. The ruling system has it's very own dark side which strives the pirates to struggle and fight against it for their freedom.\nThe story follows an ambitious and high spirited young boy Monkey d. Luffy who aims to become the \"King of Pirates\"\nby conquering the seas and finding one piece. As he ventures on his quest he makes many allies with\nnever ending bonds and stumbles across enemies, kicking their ass for good and more importantly his crewmates who swore their loyalty to him as their captain and work hard to make their dreams come true.\nThe crew starts their journey in the grand line, the toughest seas that are feared by everyone which only Gol d. Roger was managed to conquer. The Grand line is described as hell and as a nightmare for every pirate which the crew rocks in as the \"Strawhat Pirates\" named after their captain's hat.\nOne piece has the best adventures, high action, drama and comedy that you can ask for. The bonds and relations between the characters are well built in such a way that if you follow them close enough you are sure to wet your tissues. With beautiful seas, islands and breath taking stunts, nerve wracking epic battles, loads of laughter, great openings and ending tracks and addictive OST's you will never want to miss this out anymore. I am sure you will be loving the crew while they progress towards their goal.\nFinally One Piece is a best source for inspiration and motivation, the theme of \"never give up on your dreams no matter what the cost is\" gets the good expression here. Every character of one piece whether it be protagonists or antagonists have their own believes, sense of justice and vision of the world for which they fight for putting them on high stakes. If you want to change your approach or view towards the world then you must watch one piece. It can be undoubtedly crowned as Best of the best shounen series. Their adventures still continue as they unfold various mysteries and cruel fates.\nAt the end of the day don't expect the crew to be all kind, gentle and selfless, they're PIRATES after all",

This show has several problems, but by far the biggest issue is the way it tells its story.Each episode is about a random event from the family's past, and all these events happen over the course of many years, so we get to see this family grow and age over the season. Seems pretty straightforward on paper, but for this sort of thing to work, the events should be told CHRONOLOGICALLY, and this show absolutely doesn't do that, with each episode just being from a random year, making the whole thing feel very disconnected.Mind you, I watched the episodes NOT in the way they're presented, but in the order in which each episode takes place. So instead of episode 1, I started at episode 9, working my way through the season in a completely random fashion based on when each episode takes place. The order I watched it in didn't seem to have any real bearing on the narrative, so why couldn't they just release these episodes in the correct order?Even watching the show in the order God intended, I wasn't particularly invested in the unfolding series of events, nor did I care much about these characters or how their relationships were changing, and that's a big problem. Most of the cast I just don't find very interesting, such as the mom being an even more stereotypical version of Kyle's mom from South Park.As for the visuals, this show looks deceptively decent in stills. In motion, however, is a different story. Hearing this show was from the people behind BoJack, I was expecting the same rigged animation method, and that's exactly what we got here.So to make a long story short, Long Story Short just falls short. At least the first season does. Apparently there's another season on the way, and who knows, maybe this was just a particularly rough start and they'll improve upon everything that went wrong here? Seems like wishful thinking to me, but I guess it's not too late for this show to redeem itself. For now though, I am very much not a fan of this show, sad to say.",

Idk if there will be a second season, but i dont mind if it wont, the show is perfect as it is, and i love every single little detail on it.

Rachel the spoiled yet sweet girl, Monica the mother figure, Phoebe the hippy chick, Joey the dopey yet cool Italian, Chandler the sarcastic loser and Ross the neurotic victim stay together to help each other with their problems in the big city.

The acting is amazing; after watching a few episodes you stop referring to the actors by their real names altogether, even if they appear in another movie. The characters are addictive, none are completely positive or negative. It would be quite easy to get along with or to be very annoyed by any of them in real life. Yet, all of them together (or even divided in groups) create this amazing chemistry that most people desire and few lucky ones have. The humor is wonderful, no matter what type of humor you like, you will get to a point where you will find at least something absolutely hilarious. There is slapstick, some light humor, some dark humor, some raunchiness, some cheesiness - a little bit of everything. The story is captivating; viewers keep coming back to see what situation fate (being the writers) puts the characters in today. It is truly a television masterpiece.There are, however, many people who scoff at the mentioning of 'Friends'. My guess is they've never seen or paid attention to the show. It's easy to discard something because \"everyone likes it\" and be \"unique\", when in reality the uniqueness is actually bias. Just watch a few episodes with before making any judgements - chances are you'll fall in love with it too. I would have serious doubts about one's sense of humor if I heard that they hated 'Friends'.",

The trouble with this is, Seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great writing, Friends had (and I'm being very generous here) at most 5 or 6 OK seasons and then 4 abysmal seasons.It became a soap opera with recycled humour and recycled character traits that weren't that good so start with, then got worse at the 100th time you saw them.

            "review": "Easily in my top five category of funniest and best shows in prime time history.Everyone on this show is so witty and delivers their lines superbly that it's hard not to like all of them equally.  However, I do have my favorite characters/actors/actresses, as I'm sure everyone who has watched the show even once or twice, to those who are avid fans of it.We'll start from least favorite to best character/actor.Matt Le Blanc/Joey Tribbiani:Although some might say, because of his boyish good looks, his cute jokes that he delivers now and then (very well, mind you), and his ability to make you feel sweet and sorry for him at the same time, he is a great actor, and plays his part as Joey Tribbiani really well, he's probably my least favorite on the show.  I love him, don't get me wrong, but I just appreciate everyone else's talents on the show much more.Jennifer Aniston/Rachel Green:Rachel Green is a fun-loving, cute little waitress, who seems to always have trouble finding Mr. Right, who is plainly right in front of her 24/7.  Who is that, you ask?  Well, obviously Ross Gellar.  Her roommate Monica's brother.  Rachel is undoubtedly most everyone's favorite character who watches this show, just not mine.  Sometimes her personality can get a little annoying, and although I like her better than Joey, not very much more.  But, that doesn't go without saying that I don't love her in movies. Because, well, I do.Courtney Cox/Monica Gellar:It's hard to put Monica Gellar so far down the list, but if I have to make room for the other three, than so be it. As much as I love her on this show, she's just not as good as she is in the 'Scream' trilogy.  But, she certainly does a good job convincing you that she hates to be wrong, has to have everything her way, and is a real trooper with most all of her challenges on the show, that the writers give her.Lisa Kudrow/Pheobe Buffey:Now, I love Lisa Kudrow.  She is definitely one of the funniest woman comedians, which is why I classify her as my favorite female on the show. She outdid herself in 'Romy And Michele's High School Reunion', but she's extraordinary on this show.  She's so ingenious with her comedy which is no doubt why she's won several awards for her role on the program.David Schwimmer/Ross Gellar:It's so funny to me that I like him so much.  He's not the best actor in my opinion, but he was really good in Kissing A Fool, and really just ok in The Pallbearer, but my second favorite on the show.  He's so funny and he cracks me up with all of his facial expressions and the excellent way he delivers his lines.  He is definitely my second favorite character and actor on the show.Matthew Perry/Chandler Bing:They should have a shrine dedicated to this man.  He is so outstandingly funny in every single project that he works on!  He is so hysterical and a true actor in everything that he does, it is amazing that someone can be so talented.  I wish that he were given more roles than just the few comedies he's been in, including Friends. But, he is such a great character on the show, it's hard to picture the program without him. With that being said, I would also like to add that he is not only the best actor on the show, and one of my personal favorites, but I also believe that he would be such a great dramatic actor if given the chance.  If you've seen him in 'She's Out Of Control' you'll know what I'm talking about.So, with that I give this show a definite 10/10.  It's one of the best shows to come out within the last ten years, and definitely on my top five best shows of all time list.And that's my review.",

Its damn funny and no one can deny it. Except for stiffs. And whats best about Friends is that its REAL.Ross and Rachel getting old? How could it? Do relationships get old in real life? No, they're ongoing, sometimes stagnating, sometimes changing. Thats REAL.This show is about 6 people who love each other like family...which I must say as an 18 year old... is very real. Once you hit your late teens - early twenties...things begin to change. You grow both closer to and further from your biological family, and as you reach more independence, you adopt another family of your own: YOUR FRIENDS.We may not all sit in coffee shops, but we all LOVE our friends like they were blood.

Every week it was the same plot, with some wacky jokes by Phoebe, some moronic jokes by Joey, some boring jokes by Ross and Rachel, some anal retentive jokes by Monica, and some mildly charming jokes by Chandler. I realize, that this inherently is not a bad thing. Not every show is meant to push the boundaries of television. However, if you're going to rest on your laurels, and bring nothing new to the table, you should at least do a damn good job of it.

Each one of the characters is funny in their own way and due to the shows fast pace there is never a boring episode.I will say however that towards the end Friends did start to lose what it had but, never the less was still very good.

I've never ever got the popularity of this, especially outside of America.In each of the last 3 houses I've lived in over the last 10 years at least one person in each house has been an avid 'Friends' fan, so I am fully exposed to it, and have seen many episodes. It's also on tele every day.Where do I start? The title is as good a place as any. I can imagine the producers discussing that: \"Right, we've got a comedy about a group of friends, we need a name? How about Friends\" If that's the imagination it doesn't leave much hope for the story lines.I know it's a lighthearted sit com but come on? How old are they supposed to be? They were too old for that sort of lifestyle in series 1, here we are ten years later & nothings changed. They're all approaching the big 40! yet they're still living the lives of 18 year olds.And how the hell do they afford those penthouses? They change their jobs like I change my underpants, Monica worked in a kitchen, Joey can't get any acting work. The rent would be thousands.Friends is nothing more than the equally benal & tedious 'Saved by the Bell' but for grown-ups. It's the old flogged-to-death \"Three guys, three girls, all stunningly gorgeous, occasionally fancy or sleep with each other & with no friends whatsoever outside of their little group.\"The only thing funny about about Friends is unintentionally funny. Those parties they occasionally have in their flat (penthouse). The so called guests they invite, who stand in the background desperately trying to fit in & pass themselves off as close companions of the characters, when it's clear to the entire watching world that they've met for the first time at the start of the shot.It's a combination of many little things that contribute to the problem. It's the most unrealistic portrayal of New York in history. No black people, Chinese or anyone ethnic for that matter, even with minor parts. It's New York! One of the most multi cultural cities on the planet.Admittedly there is one funny aspect I have omitted. Chandler. The guy is enormously talented, makes the entire show, and seems solely responsible for what laughs or comedy there is.Rachel & Monica are likable characters & not annoying, but nor are they funny. But the past stories of either of them not being able to get a man. Come on? Please. Don't treat the viewer as a two year old.Joey is likable but is given no script to work with. Too many comedies think that by putting a thick character in they will automatically be amusing. Wrong. Trigger is Only Fools & Horses was thick but funny with it, because of the timing. He's comments were made at exactly the right time. Joey's are not, & unfortunately for a good actor & potentially very good character, he comes over more as irritating than anything else.But the real problem with Friends are in Ross & Phoebe. The only applicable description of Ross is that he needs a good kick up the back-side, to put some oomf (?) into the bloke. He's a drip. He just drones on & on in that slow dull manner, series after series. In any real life situation a Ross & a Rachel would just not be a couple. A Rachel & a Brad Pitt would be a couple, somewhat appropriately.But even he can't beat Phoebe for irritation. It's not the actress at all that's the problem, it's 100% the character. I just don't get her. The Floor Manager must hold up the \"Laugh Now\" board for the audience after every line she says. For the life of me, I just don't know what she says that is funny.And in the equally irritating coffee lounge. (Why are the sofas always empty? Never once have they had to sit somewhere else or wait for some other people to move), those scenes where she plays her guitar. I've been to funerals funnier than them. All she does is sing in coherent songs that don't rhyme, or make any sense whatsoever. Anyone could write a sketch like that.I also cannot sit through any show where people walk into other people houses without knocking on the door. No-one I know would put up with that, even from their Grandparents. Nor people who say \"Hey\" instead of Hello, but thats getting as tedious as the show now.",

I have to assume that the people who find this series so riveting only do so to live vicariously through the lives of the characters. Either that or they are immature yuppie wannabees whose sensibilities have been compromised by gamma rays. The effusiveness of most of the positive reviews made me want to throw up.Friends\" reeks of nauseating sexual innuendos that are spat out like projectiles from a tennis ball machine.When it comes to dealing with sex, \"Cheers\", Frasier\" and \"Seinfeld\" were far more clever, witty and intelligent. \"Seinfeld\" co-creator Larry David wanted his show's humor to be based largely on real experiences. The show broke one barrier after another and either originated or popularized numerous expressions. \"Seinfeld's\" sexual humor was clever and original; on \"Friends\" it was on the same level as smut.On \"Cheers,\" Ted Danson as babe hound Sam Malone was far more endearing than any of the male characters on \"Friends.\" The show never ran out of hilarious one-liners, which was quite a feat considering that the show didn't often venture outside the confines of a bar.\"Frasier\" was both cerebral and jocular (how many TV shows make references to the Algonquin Round Table?) Kelsey Grammar's Frasier Crane was sidesplitting as he pursued one failed relationship after another, but he never descended to the low-level sexual innuendos that were characteristic of \"Friends.\"Unlike evergreens such as the \"Dick Van Dyke Show,\" 20 years from now \"Friends\" will have been consigned to the dustbin of forgotten TV shows alongside \"Meet Millie\" and \"Hey, Jeannie.\" We'll see.",

Let me count the ways:Firstly, it rated an \"F\" with the test audience (don't believe me, check The Smoking Gun).Secondly, it ran 10 years without being remotely funny ONCE (beating the record held by the completely laugh-free 8 year run of Full House, which, like this crap, was produced by a division of the Time Warner media empire, had three males and three females in a completely unrealistic version of a major American city, bland-looking guy of Mediterranean descent trying to get into show business, and a dumb guy named Joey).Third, that horrible theme makes NSync sound like The Beatles.Fourth, the cast couldn't act its way out of a paper bag (I thank one of the other posters for pointing out that Jennifer \"I'm not a star, I just sleep with them\" Aniston is Telly Savalas's goddaughter. Her father is also on Days of Our Lives. Can you say nepotism, boys and girls?).Fifth, the writers would eat up clichés like that last one I wrote as if they were brand new. And not only did they steal from the superior-by-default Seinfeld, they stole from Mr. Bean and even Punky Brewster! When Soleil Moon Frye, who really must have needed the money by that point, punched Chandler in the face, even that felt like a retread of a Punky episode where she punched Chad Allen in the face!Sixth, how can they afford an apartment like that in New York? They hold menial jobs yet they look like they could be living at Southfork. On other, superior, actually FUNNY roommate shows like The Odd Couple, Three's Company, Kate & Allie, and the grand dame of them all, The Golden Girls, they seem to look they are either living with their means or cutting back to afford to pay rent. I've seen fewer logical leaps on Gilligan's Island.What's worse is all the Emmies it got. Truly great shows like Bob Newhart's two classic sitcoms never won a single thing, yet this wins \"Best\" Comedy series. This show and Seinfeld (not a terrible show but an extremely overrated one as well) are the reason sitcoms are dead right now and will probably remain dead (the last time sitcoms were declared \"dead\" in the early 1980s was a golden age in comparison to today). As long as there continue to be reruns and DVD releases of classic, pre-1990s sitcoms such as I Love Lucy, The Dick Van Dyke Show, Bewitched, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, All in the Family, The Jeffersons, Soap, Cheers, Family Ties, Newhart, The Cosby Show, The Golden Girls, Married With Children, Roseanne, pre-2000 Simpsons, and countless others like it then I say let it die.This is truly the most vile, trite, unfunny, obnoxious television series of all time. I jumped for joy the day it was canceled, and I hope that future generations will see it for the garbage it truly is, because this one has been taken in by the snow job perpetrated by these hacks.",

Other than these major flaws, the show is just missing something else that many other comedy's have, and I think it's the lack of a good or serious plot along with humor. Other shows like Weeds and The United States of Tara are comical, but also have a strong plot and theme. I think the comedy in those shows makes it light in some ways and watchable, but also these shows are brilliant by highlighting individual people and society's problems. Even shows like Arrested Development and Grounded For Life apply more to the \"good comedy but strong plot and theme.\"And if the writer or director's goal was not to have a dramatic plot, then they should have some warm meaning to the show. For example, Full House, The Nanny, and Golden Girls had a lot of the humor but gave great messages. The importance of family support in Full House, how true friends will always help you in Golden Girls, and how a full-time care take for children can really help a family and bring out the best in children whose parents are absent such as The Nanny. I think Friends tries too much to be like a Seinfeld for teens and young adults. However, Seinfeld has much better writing and humor.Every time I watched this show it always ended up boring me.

Nothing to contribute to society... never once I see the characters face real problems of debt, psychological torture, or identity crisis (Like Chandler experiencing what being Gay feels like for a day, or Rachel hanging with the poor. Or even Phoebe living in an asylum?) And about the racial cultures... Usually I never see them date anyone else other than a few colors to \"liven\" the space. Oh, the token black person that comes out one or two episodes is not helping either. Seeing as New York is full of culture, they made it look like the other races are not important.Their lifestyle is perfect. They crapped money out of their really low-paying jobs and spend most of their time well, sipping their coffee, stalking about that hot guy or girl and plans to bang them later to the episode, ending with a break-up for the dumbest of reasons.Aside from Chandler, their jobs are almost impossible to ask why their apartments costs more than what they earn. Well, Monica has \"rent control\" but hey... no one tried to kick her out yet... Ross is still controlling his money after all the divorces he has been in. Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe gave a speech on not taking charity, but hey, they suck the living breeches of the first three and claiming paying them back was almost impossible.Okay, off with the plots, let's go to the characters...Character analysis: Chandler - He is apparently one of the more humorous characters. He is a sample of a realistic person who we can hang out in the office or sip some coffee or something. I don't have problems with him and Monica together, to the dismay of all the true-blue Frendsian fans.Phoebe - I like her for being a bit different in the first few seasons... but then after a while, she started being horny, annoying, and kind of a hypocrite. Okay, so she has a hard life... but people like her in real life, struggle to be as normal as possible. She just left that philosophy behind because of it. It's not even trying until the tenth season or so...Monica - She isn't a funny character, but she has been a person who actually is believable in ways that she is right, and she is apparently the mature one. Sadly, she is usually looked down upon because her other Friends think that her style is annoying. Sadly, her baby-freak, \"I can be like anyone else\" philosophy threw me off after like season one. I always wondered why she wasn't kicked out of the circle.Rachel - I hate her. She hasn't changed ever since day one, to be honest. Her personality is this \"Me-Me-Me!\" spoiled brat who went to the city, and a few jobs and a million boyfriends later... it's still all about \"Me!\" The relationship with her and Ross was somewhat annoying for and a mood killer for almost forever, and almost in the last episode of the series, BANG! They're together again. Can Ross just leave or slap Rachel for all the horrible things she has done to him? Oh Noooo... because Ross is too in \"loooove\" with Rachel... Reasons were almost to no idea... Having sexual thoughts with Chandler and almost having a short, useless hit-off with Joey was also not helping.Ross - I pitied his first season philosophy and hey, I liked him for being at least sympathetic there... just that he had two additional divorces that he became a screaming, yelling, irritating person who is smart and intelligent, yet acts dumb and immature for his age. The whole Rachel thing is lost of chemistry and yeah, they were on a break. Rachel is apparently responsible for all of the things that happened to them and then claiming after the whole fiasco that the writers make it say that it's Ross' fault anyway for Rachel's doing. Ross would be better off on a suicide for being with a devil woman.Joey - Dumb Actor who doesn't do anything to contribute to society. Oh yeah, his spin off may be the worst thing anyone has ever made... Even if I can feel things from the characters. He is a handsome guy, that's a contribution right? And Him having sex with 500 girls is considered a real good thing. In general, actors have to research their roles, and Joey... he just swoops in Shakespeare because hey... He's an actor!To conclude, I have been annoyed by the show... and I get why people love it so much. It's the art of Escapism of them in a Fantasy world that makes everyone love them so. But sadly, I have watched shows that actually make use of real life as a humor tool that makes Friends forgettable for me. For ten years, nothing truly EVER happened.. and parodies like \"Furends\" are apparently more of a short version of the whole rant.A 1 out of ten... Just because I can't give negative number rankings. :(",

Really bad story lines and tired, old plots make it really difficult to get through every episode Not just depressing but Maggie is the worst person i have ever seen short of a serial killer with no ability to look beyond herself. She is selfish. She is self centered. She is so easily manipulated by those around her and she is soooooo weak. They make her seem like a strong women but portray her and a total wimp.

The first episode was a little slow (understandable while getting to know the characters), but my advice to anyone watching it is to keep going because there is a LOT of depth and background to all the characters and their storylines! I've been watching it every week as soon as it comes out. It gives me Virgin River vibes with the family history, love story, some suspenseful moments. The cast is great and I LOVE seeing Scott Patterson and Chad Michael Murray back on the screen, they absolutely blow these roles out of the park and I have been a huge fan of them for years! As a newer actress, Morgan does amazing at playing the role of Maggie and ensuring the audience feels and understands what she's feeling. As a Canadian I love that it's filmed in Canada and touches on Canadian history, not many shows have done that and done it so incredibly well. I think this show will be a really big hit with more seasons to come, and I look forward to continuing to watch!",

Tom Jackson gives a good performance. It's another Roby Carr soap opera like her other one, Virgin River.Canada produces some good TV series like \"Wild Cards\", \"Hudson & Rex\" and \"Saint-Pierre\", they are much better than Sullivan's Crossing and Virgin River.",

Big thank you to Chad M Murray for portraying Cal so wonderfully. Chad gives so much deepness and dignity to his character. I believed Cal every single time I saw him in the scene. Of course, there is also Morgan Kohan who portrayed Maggie. I like this edge about Maggie. I like how bold and sensitive her character is. I also really enjoyed the slow pacing and how carefully their relationships unfold, how we find just a new bit with every episode, which builds up a lot of good tension.As for Sully and Maggie, their story is very touching, but I would like Maggie to be a bit more mature in this. Having some similar experience in my life and watching how much those two need to finally open up to each other, I see Maggie's hesitancy a bit far-fetched. I just hope they manage to put their past behind and get closer in season 2!It won't be a full review if I don't mention the general atmosphere of the show.

Like that!Series today unlike years back milk things to death,with many parts & seasons,where it impacts a viewers interest..\nWhere unlike years back you're not as excited,to see what happens next week-quality cliffhangers are one thing-unlike how it's approached now.What could of helped,again..\nDon't stretch things out,air two episodes or drop all episodes at once.Give us a few milk bones of closure,resolve,ect..\nIt won't ruin anything enough,for a viewer to not return.So far the lead female or any character,isn't likeable enough currently but will give it another chance.I have not read any book based on this,unsure if that would make a difference? Regardless it's lackluster in several aspects,maybe a bad script or certain actors to their acting but somethings a miss.Definitely isn't a Virgin River feel,but also think it's trying to playoff in a similar vibe.. So it lacks(loosely)originality or is the Wish version,therefore leaves true fans dissatisfied.Can't say the scenery or anything is great enough yet,but again will be following up if can get into the series more.Edit-\nI watched all 10 episodes even a few a couple times for perspective,but honestly my original review remains it really lacks & feel partly it's due to several(main)actors.Feel Maggie comes across boring,monotone in talking & lacks emotion.Sully comes across grumpy & not real great,maybe Maggie inherited his personality.Even when the show had emergency moments it felt cartoon-ish in approach,easily resolved & no real emotion attached to care.Hope now that Maggie,got her court stuff resolved..\nWe get more personality,drama,laughter,love & so forth.Also maybe Sully can improve,once he confronts his past ghosts.Will Cal return or not,his role was decent..\nFar as the rest of the characters,you don't remember them enough to care & if you do it's rather brief like(when Frank got shot)because of other moments.",

But THIS show, the soundtrack is annoying. And the sound increases too many times that I find myself having to adjust the sound. The main character, Maggie is a neurosurgeon. Initially seeing her in action was fine but the way she handles stress and so forth makes me frown. I was a critical care Respiratory Therapist. Now I'm disabled due to an injury with chronic pain. Stuff I've been through in my professional life and in my personal life, my stress relief is screaming in a pillow or back then, working out. I know people react differently but her responses to her problems just seem too cheesy. I just think there was a lot of over acting. I don't remember who wrote the article but, better than Virgin River? Nah ah, no way, no how. I will continue to watch cuz I'm watching it while none of my other shows are on. But, if there is a season two, I'd have no idea if I'd watch it. Right now, it's on while I'm watching it so it doesn't hold my full attention. Oh, I'm going to be a little too immature right now with this next comment. But, the boyfriend of Maggie, Andrew, who is played by Allan Hawco is definitely not who'd I consider a good catch. His beard and mouth, all I see is Homer Simpson. I fast forward or don't look at the TV cuz, eww. Five stars cuz it's something to watch and put on TV to pass the time for me. But I guess I can compare it to a Hallmark movie. So if you like Hallmark, over dramatic and cheesy, you should like this.Edit: I didn't realize there was a season two when I was writing the first review. I shouldn't have said what I said because I tend to have to finish shows. The only time I don't finish watching, is if it's really boring that I can't stay awake watching.

This version takes place 172 years before the first series and focuses on the Targaryen line of succession: a male heir vs. Female heir. Go figure, medieval monarchies just have not gotten the memo on equal rights - Don't they realize it's 2022?House of the Dragon is not bad compared to 'Rings of Power' - a very low bar indeed - but it is a pale reflection of the original: It lacks teeth; it's tame; it feels more like a history lesson than Game of Thrones. Frankly, House of Dragon reflects the wave of political correctness that has taken over Hollywood. The show has race swapped white characters; while the show also has a contrived focus on childbirth scenes and tends to push female characters at the expense of most of the male characters - Daemon is the only male character remotely interesting. To make matters worse, the characters talk like people from 2022 dressed in costumes.Grades:Casting: Grade D+. Actors do not reach the quality of the original series. Casting reflects the latest Hollywood tiresome obsession: racial quotas and affirmative action type casting - when they ignore the source material. It's a distraction for purely ideological, not artistic reasons.Story: Grade C. The story feels like an Eilzabeth the Tudor queen period piece (with a little Richard III and Hamlet mixed in.) The original Game of Thrones had fantastic elements, iconic characters, and engrossing plot twists: House of the Dragon is mundane in comparison.Production: A. Sets, CGI, costumes are HBO quality. Slightly inferior to the original, but still pretty good.Overall: C-. This series could have been much better: The show runners were clearly terrified of criticism from the twitter crowd directed toward Game of Thrones regarding race, women's roles, nudity, sex scenes, etc. - but apparently gore and gratuitous violence is still o.k. House of the Dragon deserves a rating of about 6 or 7. I rated it 4 because the inflated ratings of 10 skew the results.",

Not a single part of this programme is enjoyable not he actors ( some of whom are fantastic in other stuff) the writing, the action or the sets. Nothing is right, it should be a good enough show but ir doesn't excel anywhere. Being a latecomer to the original series and having the luxury of binge watching episode after episode due to the amazing story and quality was brilliant.

Have you ever seen those board games like Dungeons and Dragons, where you have one person set the stage and everyone else move their pieces one at a time while tossing dice on squares. This is exactly that, you have a king and everyone around him wants the crown. And they'll spend endless episodes whining about how it should have been theirs. And how they deserve it, and how everyone else has been bad to them. And it's just endless whining.I can't understand how they went from the Game of Thrones to this lackluster and sad rendition of who wants the crown more. And you know what the truly sad part is? It MIGHT have been ok if they had a few characters that were likable, and aged with the show. But the only person that was likable to me was the princess, and what they managed to do is replace her with an \"older version\" of her like 5 episodes in. So there goes all the actor investment right out the window.3/10 we deserved much better than this.Final Update: It is now episode 9 in the first season, and I've stopped watching it about half way through, because I genuinely couldn't care less about anything that happens anymore in this series.

After all, it wouldn't have been here if not for GOT.And while the first couple of episodes didn't exactly impress me, I decided to watch the whole season before judging it. I mean, giving it the chance to develop the characters, it was bound to get better, right ?Wrong ! It didn't !The crew in charge of lighting must have gone on strike, cause most of the season played out in semi darkness, and it also seemed like most of the episodes had plot for about 30 minutes of time, which caused scenes to be dragged out painfully, and supplied with fillers like 10 minutes of soft porn in #4, and 10 minutes of people dancing in #5.And then there was the time jumps. The season spanned about 20 years, so we were treated to a lot of changing actors, but oddly enough some characters didn't seem to age at all. Otto, Daemon, Rhaenys and Criston looked pretty much like they did at the beginning of the season. I guess the makeup crew was too busy turning Viserys into a crypt keeper lookalike, to do something about that.As for the acting, I'm not gonna comment on that, since the lack of character build gave the actors very little to work with. That also meant that whenever somebody was killed, I was mostly like \"right, so that happened\", because they hadn't build up the character enough for anyone to care.If they wanted to make a spin off, from a popular show, they could at least have tried to maintain just a bit of the quality of the original, but this was just a very sloppy production way below what we have come to expect from HBO.The dragons looked great though :)",

At times it feels glorious and epic, with shocking brutal surprises as we have come to expect from Game of thrones. At other times, it feels safe, with pulled punches where it clearly veers away from the source material such as making the queens more reluctant, reticant, or the surprisingly unsexy sex scenes.It's clear that there's a certain sensibility in the writers room to make the female characters more sympathetic than the source material, or to play it safer with the sex scenes and some of the drama, but this subtracts from the very essence of the brutal place Westeros is, and robs the viewers of real drama and entertainment - for example the tension between the two houses for example is considerably diminished by this treatment.In the first season the VFX are lacking, but clearly things have come together by the second season VFX wise. The acting, score and cinematography are all excellent, and the series is, taken as a whole still entertaining. But it feels like whenever a choice is made to divergence from source, that choice is to make the show essentially more dull than it should be.",

There are no beauties or handsome men like there are in GOT, except for the wife of the king who obviously doesn't have a long contract. There is a reason why actors become popular and it is usually about their look's whether they play a good guy or a bad guy. The scene with violence felt like it was just slotted in to give the impression it was like GOT and being as we didn't get to know the people being butchered beforehand, it fell flat. GOT kings and queens all had a presence with booming voices and it felt like they had power in their own mind, the king and prince in HOTD were lacking that. Whereas I couldn't wait to watch GOT every week I'm not sure I will be so excited to watch this, it just felt like a weaker repeat without the aesthetics, nor the emotion for the viewer that is accompanied. I don't feel I care about what will happen to any of the characters and hopefully they wiont stretch out the irritating prince character for too many episodes which will become annoying and make me want to switch off from watching it. But so far without him they don't really have much of a storyline, albeit one we have seen before in GOT. Too much hype has gone into this series so I was expecting something special and am disappointed with the same stuff.",

            "review": "I was surprised when I saw this show because WB has a reputation for churning out mindless, sleazy shows that don't add any value to television. 'Gilmore Girls' has to be the only quality show on WB and one of the few on television in general. It's about the relationship between a mother and daughter in a small town in Connecticut. Lorelai Gilmore had Rory when she was 16 and ran away from her uptight, old money parents to start her own life independently as a maid at an inn and then working her way up to general manager. Their relationship is more like a sister relationship than a parent-child relationship. The townspeople only add charm to the show.'Gilmore Girls' is an intelligent show with quick, witty dialogue that often refers to literature, music, movies, and pop culture. The characters talk extremely fast, which can be quite unrealistic sometimes when in a span of five seconds, two people can create comebacks for each other that contain references to Shakespeare and Madonna. But c'mon, it's just a show, and the point of the fast-paced dialogue and references is for the entertainment of audiences. We watch the show, hear the dialogue and laugh hard because we know what they're talking about. It's what makes 'The Simpsons' enjoyable, and the same can be applied to 'Gilmore Girls'. We know that such a quirky place as Stars Hollow most likely doesn't exist, but we watch it for the admiration for a dedicated single mother, hard-working daughter, and their minds that are abundant with intelligent and witty remarks about everything from Billy Bob Thornton to Bob Dylan.Give it a try. It's just one smart joke after another. Definitely not a typical WB show.",

            "review": "Gilmore Girls is one of those shows that people love because they're so adorable...and they simply don't know it. And not teen pop bunk adorable, but as in they're easy to love. I was surprised by the quality of the series, considering it's on the WB. It's intelligent, creative, and sophisticated in an everyday way. And even though this show has enough sarcasm to give you heartburn (it's fueled by sarcasm, in double digit gallons) the characters are fleshed out and live an alternate lifestyle that may be foreign, but is completely believable. These aren't people who live stereotyped mid class American TV lives, they live like the people next door, but like the strange people next door. They're those specially chosen eccentrics, small town hicks, artists, and snobs who are so full of quirks and idiosyncrasies they tend to make our lives colorful.And this show is about characters and how they relate to each other. The crux of the show is the relationship between the close in age coffee addict mother (Loralai, played by the fantastic Lauren Graham) and daughter (Rory, beautifully played by Alexis Bledel) who have an unusually close knit, and witty, relationship. The two are an eccentric pair,  they live for each other and pay no heed to those who sneer upon them and indulge in their wacky Bohemian-ness. They eat at Luke's Diner for breakfast and order economy size platters of Chinese food from Al's House of Pancakes. Rory likes chaperones, Loralai intrinsically trusts her daughter.When Rory is accepted to a posh prep school (which she doesn't care for, but deals with because, quite simply, she has a higher IQ than most of the town and wants to get to Harvard) paid for by her incorrigible and borderline personality grandmother  (another recurring character), her mother has to take a job she doesn't want at a first class hotel, and thus a whole passel of problems and dilemmas occur. Long term plot lines gracefully combine with town occurrences, scandals, gossip, etc, and create a show with as much flavor and pizzazz as Stars Hollow can take.And where the sarcasm and one liners, bizarre scenarios and crazy happenings flow freely there's always an underlying riptide that surfaces quickly here and there, and the tensions that arise can become especially pungent because we're allowed to be close to the characters. For example, in one episode Rory accidentally falls asleep next to her boyfriend late one night while they were both reading a book together, and next morning they are found by Miss Patty (the fabulously fabulous Liz Torres who is also from \"American Family\"), nothing had happened, Rory is completely innocent, but Loralai is worried when she's alerted that she hadn't come home and receives the call that they had been found together. Rory's grandmother jumps to conclusions and starts harshly saying that Rory has ruined her life just the way Loralai had, but her mother adamantly sticks up for her. Yet when Rory comes in, they have an explosive fight, with Rory crushed that her mother didn't trust or believe her.And yet situations with even a slight potential for sugaryness are resolved with lightning fast dialogue a la `Philadelphia Story'. The fact that they're close is already there, anything else feels wrong. This is the genius of the show's writing and acting. All said, whether during revealing moments of emotion or poignancy, or the standard rib cracking, fire crackling wit and sarcasm, this show gets under your skin and refuses to let go. It's more than a gem, and I hope that it lasts.",

Was this about a rebellious rich girl and her non-rebellious daughter? What the heck is this show about? Finally, I just didn't care. The cast makes me want to scream. The writing is neither \"smart\" or \"intelligent\" it's syrupy and tedious.So why did I watch? Because I heard SO many good things about this and I am not one to voice an opinion until I have watched. Knee-Jerk reactions are usually wrong, so I watched a few times. The first time I watched this, I saw the mother running around like she was 12 and the daughter acting like she was 40. Maybe that is what didn't attract me.

So I asked her, \"What is this show about?\" A very bright young lady, usually articulate she never could give me a straight answer. So I asked others who rave about it - they really don't know either.Gilmore Girls is turning out to be a TV program that's like an \"art house movie\". Many of us wont get it, but those that go try desperately to find a meaning where there really isn't one, just to be \"hip.\" Yes, I find Lauren Graham's Lorelai annoying - whine, whine, nasally WHINE.

The plot progresses smoothly and slowly (just slow enough), and while the show changes as time passes, it doesn't change so completely as other shows in the same genre would.

(Plus, unlike all its regular shows it's an hour series.)My rule of thumb is that if a series doesn't encourage me to keep watching by its third episode, it won't do so after its thirtieth; Amy Sherman-Palladino's series passed by the end of the first one. A number of viewers have commented that the dialogue isn't too realistic, and Lorelei Gilmore is certainly so quick with the witty repartee you wonder why she's not a stand-up comic instead of managing an inn (possibly a clue as to why one of the companies involved is called Dorothy Parker Drank Here Productions?), but it does have the saving grace of actually being funny... something that can't be said for a lot of official comedies.What helps the series work so far, apart from the dialogue, is the characters - just as \"M*A*S*H\"'s laugh track was kept out of the operating room even in the American broadcasts (it was initially broadcast in the UK sans track), the relationships between Lorelei and Lorelei (that's Rory - in the pilot we learned that she was named after her mother) aren't actually played for gags endlessly, and her mother's certainly strong but not a bitch, the way the makers could have easily done. No one in the show so far is truly bad or good, which bodes well, and the bond between mother and daughter is a rare thing for TV - they're both relatives and true friends without making you want to vomit, not a common thing in family dramas.We're about three years behind the WB, and I'm looking forward to catching up with the Gilmores and their friends (it's impossible not to symapthise with Rory's best friend in particular, what with her health-food-obsessed/antique-selling mother). And on a purely shallow note, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel must be the most attractive mother-daughter pairing in recent television history. Beautiful and funny?

I have never seen a program that is about less in an era of human history that is about so much. It actually quietly blew my mind with its never-ending vapidity trying to pass for modern cool. It is basically about a woman with a daughter who grows up and goes to University where she learns nothing and has no opinion about anything except that the totally idiotic and very rich boyfriend she chucked is maybe a good guy-no wait he's a turd-no wait he's really a good guy etc etc. And etc. The woman-even though she has a daughter in University still meets with her fabulously rich parents each week for toxic cocktails nobody drinks anymore and toxic dinner conversation nobody in their right mind would bother to engage in with parents she should have said good-bye to 20 year previously. I think the show is trying to foster the idea that its a good idea to have an extended \"relationship\" with your parents in your adult life. I think doing so is a bad idea and is usually only representational of worthless companies forcing adults back to the nest-which is an option usually regarded by most adults as on a par with being trapped on a deserted island with Tom Sholz. Actress Sally Struthers from the 1970's classic sitcom All In The Family is in this show playing a woman without an opinion much like the character of Edith Bunker in All In The Family. That ain't progress. Horseshit television...with no black people in all of the 30 episodes I watched. There was one guy from Pakistan though. Very unattractive work.",

All I can say is I'm so glad I took the time to watch this show. I absolutely loved it and have now watched the series twice. Its not action packed or anything like that. It is all about the writing and the characters. Just brilliant from start to finish and is a show the entire family can watch together. Maggie Smith if you ever read these comments just know you played my favorite character out of any series I've ever watched. You made this show absolutely perfect! If you are debating on whether or not to give this show a try take it from me, you wont want the show to ever end...",

Downton Abbey was beautifully produced, well cast and interesting, when it was first advertised it looked as though ITV had a hit and from the first episode I think Downton Abbey lived up to that expectation.I for one loved how elegant Downton Abbey was. The photography was beautiful and skillful, while the scenery was breathtaking and the costumes were exquisite. The scoring was also very good, often very hypnotic and beautiful. The direction was controlled, the episodes were well paced and for me the characters were believable my favourites being Violet and Robert.The writing in general was another strength. It was witty in a subtle way, is often funny and could be heart warming and poignant too, the best coming from Violet and Mrs Hughes I felt. The only bit of dialogue that rang false, and this is such a minor criticism, is Robert's \"Downton is my third parent and my fourth child\" which came across as somewhat cheesy. And the stories were well written and as believable as the characters, not to mention pretty original.And of course the acting was excellent. Maggie Smith was perfect as Violet. She plays this sort of character well, and she had such good timing and dialogue. Plus I love her in costume. Hugh Bonneville was dashing, and I cannot get over how beautiful Michelle Dockery was here. Jessica Brown-Findlay was also fine as another of my favourite characters Lady Sybil, and Phyllis Logan was always good value though I would love to see more of her if and when the series returns.In conclusion, Downton Abbey was a wonderful series thanks to the great cast and production values especially and I cannot wait to see more. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

You'll be captivated immediately and hours will go by before you realize you've spent an entire afternoon in front of your television set. The relationships built between all characters of this show are what tie it up in a nice, fluffy (although not always pretty) bow. Brilliantly written and set in lush, vibrant surroundings with detailed costuming, this drama series should set the bar for others. No busy dialog or wasted scenes, just good, solid craftsmanship in every episode of this poignant family story. You'll do well to invest in seasons 1 and 2. Looking forward to the arrival of season 3!",

            "review": "I'm amazed to find that not only do many Americans give high marks to this badly written, poorly directed, and frequently ham-acted period soap opera but so do plenty of Brits.For me it's all in the writing, which is awful. Not just that much of the history is incorrect or missing key elements but the characters are never fleshed-out and remain one-dimensional. Plot lines quickly fade away, never to reappear without any just cause. Other plots go on for far too long.The writing by Julian Fellowes, is surprisingly poor, even for an actor. The obvious lack of research is for me unnerving. Worse than that is Fellowes simply plagiarizes most of the story and even characters. A little Waugh, Jan Struther, Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins, Coward, Alcott, Forster and Christie to name but a few. Even Maggie Smith's character comes off as one dimensional; a sassy dowager stock character with nothing to offer other than witty one-line barbs.If Fellowes' name (I only know of him as the writer of Gosford Park - but that film had a strong director, Robert Altman) is enough to get a project green-lighted, surely the production budget allows enough for a script doctor? Downton Abbey is in dire need of one.And because I am familiar with a few of the fine actors in Downton Abbey, watching them wrestle with a weak script and simply terrible plot lines, it's embarrassing to witness. Only Siobhan Finneran seems to be able to rise above the putrid pablum.Yes the gowns, jewels, men's suits, complexions, interior sets, exteriors etc...are all gorgeous and beautiful. But that's it. There is nothing beneath the exquisite facade. No substance.It's incredible how many awards this trash has won in both the UK and US. Downtown Abbey should be shown to screenwriters and playwrights for how NOT to write. It's also incredible that this program scores so highly on IMDb; just unbelievable.If you like period dramas, Masterpiece Theatre, BBC stuff - you should search out Granada TV's 1981 Brideshead Revisited, PBS' 1970's Upstairs Downstairs (produced by the excellent John Hawkesworth) or Christine Edzard's Little Dorrit (1988), BBC's more recent Bleak House (2005) and Little Dorrit (2008).",

I have watched Masterpiece since the inaugural with Alistair Cooke, and I can't remember anything as engaging and entertaining as this. As a cousin of an English family with deep affection for the monarchy and respect for the aristocracy, my perspective is an odd mix of Democratic ideals, old-time Republican values and curiosity about and appreciation of the social structure which prevailed so long in England. Downton Abbey appears to present a very balanced depiction of the social, political, economic and historical forces which drove the lives and fortunes of the classes and produced strange and almost incomprehensible behavior to comply with an unwritten, all-pervasive code. I am completely fascinated by the events and reactions and what would appear to be almost puppet-like behavior on occasion. I pray for a sequel.",

(anyone interested can find short interviews with actor Hugh Bonneville and writer Julian Fellowes via youtube and be infected with their enthusiasm as well as getting an explanation, if you need one, of the setting) The house is suitably dramatic and the fabrics, the costumes, the camera shots of ringing bells and curious meal courses in the form of fences of asparagus, the morning light, or lit windows across the lawn, and the smooth work of all the actors make it something to watch and be both interested and relaxed. There is just enough drama and just enough calm, nothing seems overdone, and (after two episodes) the characters, as it switches between moments of their various days, are none of them an unwelcome change from the view of the last. It is a costume drama but 1912 after all was just as real as 2010 and it is, quite separate from costumes, about people, several different people, house workers and owners, their motives, their histories, pain, relationships, scheming allegiances, awkwardness or ease, old ways and the coming of those things we now call modern electric lights, the middle classEnjoyable so far. However, if you find these things dull, if you need constant shocks, use the word inoffensive as an insult or dislike all period dramas, scenery or rich peoplestay away. It's not hard to do.",

It smacks of a daytime soap opera! What nonsense! It's also terribly \"choppy\", with scenes lasting only 30 seconds to a minute (perhaps why it's so popular in the U.S.). The characters are also too entirely comical and cliché. The distant, preoccupied lord, clueless as to the goings-on under his own roof, the stuffy butler, the fussy cook, the meddling house-keeper. Good grief! I cannot believe that people actually buy this insipid vomit! From a cultural and historically social perspective, it is entirely inaccurate. The writing is like from some Harlequin novel rubbish.

It is an honest depiction of what people \"downstairs and upstairs\" went through during those years. The conventions, the rigid rules, the traditions, all changing just in a ten year period and being uprooted and twisted by the new winds of war.There is something for everybody here. You want a thrilling story? Check! You've got it. You want love and romance? Check! You've got it. You want a social drama? Check! You've got it. You want a war drama? Check! You've got it too.It's a very human story of all characters on board of this static ship that is \"Downton Abbey\". As firm as the Rock of Gibraltar one might say. And yet, not so static after all... Lots is happening here, and this, day by day.Just think of the nightmare to have a sudden dinner invitation. The kitchen is in uproar, serving hands are missing, the masters are nervous, and everything seems to be doomed from the beginning, but then, somehow, everything comes together beautifully, like by magic...

            "review": "Back in the 1980s Granada made two long drama serials at almost the same time. One was \"Brideshead Revisited\" based on Evelyn Waugh's novel and the other was \"Jewel in the Crown\" – the dramatisation of Paul Scott's extraordinary \"Raj Quartet\". Both these series were masterpieces and if you watch them today you will find they have stood well the test of time. The drama tradition of Granada, of some of the other commercial companies and, of course, of the BBC is strong and is something of a jewel in the crown of British television. It is also an important source of revenue, not least in the United States, where posh British TV has a small but well-heeled following. This brings me to \"Downton Abbey\", superficially in the great tradition and with obvious links also to the very successful and ground-breaking \"Forsyte Saga\" and \"Upstairs Downstairs\" of the 1960s and 1970s. Downton is set in the second and third decades of the twentieth century and we have moved from Edwardian complacency and excesses through the horrors of the Great War to the early 1920s. As with \"Upstairs Downstairs\" we see life, and to an extent history, through the eyes of the aristocracy and simultaneously from the perspective of those in the Servants' Hall.Over the 16 episodes that have so far been transmitted, spanning the years 1912-1920, the stories are reminiscent of a Soap like \"Eastenders\" or \"Coronation Street\" in that there are episode ending cliff-hangers and improbably extreme story developments. Every historic event from the sinking of the Titanic through women's suffrage, the Irish independence movement, the Battle of the Somme, the post-war Flu epidemic and many others is a trigger for something to happen in the plot. In addition we have adultery, murder, homosexuality, alcoholism, illness and recovery or death, the black market, inter-class affairs and marriage, and most of the seven deadly sins in sharp relief. The stories are often signalled rather obviously and it is an amusing parlour game to predict what will happen next - as with any soap. Taken as a whole the story is totally preposterous and the \"issues\" are not handled with any subtlety at all – there is none of the restraint of a Galsworthy, a Waugh or a Scott.The starting point for Downton Abbey was in the creative mind of the writer Julian Fellowes and its main inspiration was clearly that author's film script for \"Gosford Park\" - which won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in 2002. But whereas this film lasts a couple of hours and was tightly directed by Robert Altman Downton goes on for 20 – and running! The characters are largely pastiches of real people. Maggie Smith, for example, is wonderful as the Dowager a figure straight out of Pantomime - Dame Maggie overtly seeks hisses from the stalls. Fine actors like Hugh Bonneville, Penelope Wilton and Dan Stevens struggle with a script that is always close to parody and sometimes spills over into farce. Indeed at times there is a slight sense that they know what they are being asked to say, or the absurd plot twist in which they are expected to participate, has moved into lampoon territory and that Mel Brooks or the Directors of \"Airplane\" or \"Something about Mary\" are in charge.The great strength of Brideshead Revisited, Jewel in the Crown and the Forsyte Saga is that the stories had passed the tough test of being seen as credible in the original novel format. They were great books before they became great television. The original screenplay of \"Downton Abbey\" has had none of the checks and balances that apply to the written word. And because the medium is only to be visual, and in a number of time-limited episodes, it is presumed that there is a need to provide colourful action rather than attempt any true characterisation. We are supposed to like the Earl of Grantham because he is a benevolent toff – fragile but caring with a true sense of noblesse oblige. But compare his character, which is utterly superficially sketched, with the way that Evelyn Waugh gradually introduces Lord Marchmain in Brideshead - we feel we know the Marquess long before we meet him. The same superficiality applies to Downton's \"below stairs\" characters most of whom are stereotypes we have met frequently before.The visual impact of \"Downton Abbey\" is strong and in this area the production values are high. The sets, both in the studio and on location, are beautifully designed and the costumes and other artifacts are good and look authentic. There is a strange paradox here which I suspect has led some to assume that because it looks good then it is good - perhaps ignoring the often wooden acting and sloppy direction. Downton's viewing figures are good and this is no doubt reflected directly in the income received from advertisers and the revenue from the sale of overseas rights and DVDs etc. - it is evidently a profitable venture. So a legitimate response to those critics who deplore the triviality of the series would be to never mind the quality and weigh the receipts.There is nothing really wrong with \"Downton Abbey\" if you see it for what it is – a Soap of fleeting interest with can pass the time on an autumnal evening. However Downton does take itself quite seriously at times and some of the acting is so pompously self-important that it can only be seen as light comedy, which it isn't meant to be, or over-written moralising trash - which at times it comes dangerously close to being.",

Central among the gifted performers are Maggie Smith (as the Dowager Countess Violet), Hugh Bonneville as the Earl of Grantham, and Elizabeth McGovern as Cora, his American wife. But all of the lesser roles are played to perfection with special mention for Brendan Coyle as John Bates, Joanne Froggatt as Ana, Michelle Dockery and Laura Carmichael.Complicit in schemes involving wicked behavior are two of the downstairs help played brilliantly by Siobhan Finneran and Rob-James Collier as Thomas, both of whom cast a shadow over the household.The plot has dialog that is always witty and good for a quick chuckle or a gasp of disapproval and the character motivations are all played out in a convincing manner true to each person involved.Very compelling to view the fluid story unfold with its many sub-plots and shadings of the class warfare that existed in the U.K. then and now.Absolutely one of the most rewarding and richly satisfying shows from Great Britain that have come along in recent years.

It relies mainly on lesser known or \"has been\" actors, and a rewrite of King Lear to try and make it work. It never gets out of the realm of \"average\". The plot is choppy, and the episodes not well linked together. The focus is on backstabbing all round, with fairly stereotypical characters who curse constantly in an attempt to keep it interesting. There is a constant Predator vs Prey interaction, and the only thing that keeps one engaged is a desire to see blood spilled! The dialog and writing is childish, with everyone interrupting one another's sentences. The camera work is jerky, I guess to add a certain nuance to the shots. It's a story of shifting alliances which is common in the business world. Overall, it's worth putting at the bottom of any streaming queue, and using it to fill periods of drought in the queue.Season 3: So far, this has been \"more of the same\", except that the writers have now made the story telling a secondary focus and instead, have embarked on a quest to show how clever they are with using erudite dialog and obscure literary references in the conversation between actors. The dialog comes across as stilted and often delivered by everyone stammering when talking. It's beginning to look more like a series one might now find on NPR or similar sort of station. The camera work has become even more jerky, suddenly focusing on lips, eyes and other body parts! It is definitely losing what little appeal it had!",

            "review": "Why I was attracted to watching Succession in the first place was because I had heard that it had no likeable characters. Coupled with a backdrop of corporate America, it seemed like a show right up my alley. I had absolutely no idea that the show would exceed my expectations by a large mile.Not since The Sopranos have I seen an interplay of character dynamics this good, especially the toxic traits of those characters. Every little interaction is important, and affects another character on some or the other level significantly. Succession makes sure that behind the gaudy, showy nature of the Roy family, the ugliness of their existence is visible to you, even in the most subtle ways. The show both revels in and critiques the world it bases itself in. And I don't remember a character-driven drama being this thrilling. Hostile takeovers are usually not exciting to people uninterested in the financial world, but this show makes sure you understand the stakes involved. Like, Breaking Bad-level of tense.Of course, much of this is possible because of the phenomenal cast. I want Jeremy Strong to win an Emmy this year so badly. Kendall Roy is one of the most brilliant (and surprisingly sympathetic) characters I've seen, a mixture of Christopher Moltisanti and Jesse Pinkman, with a slice of your average venture capitalist. I just hope it doesn't typecast him as a Wall Street-type, although I love him in The Big Short too. I want him to win more than Brian Cox, who scares the living daylights out of me as Logan Roy when he merely enters a room. Then there's Sarah Snook as the prideful Shiv, an excellent, pitch-perfect arc like no other. And my man Kieran Culkin as the foul-mouthed-but-concerned Roman, another truly surprising sympathetic turn. And of course, when I talk about Roman, I will talk about Gerri, a role that actress J Smith Cameron absolutely kills, and should have received an Emmy nomination for. And this paragraph is incomplete without my love for Matthew McFadyen and Nicholas Braun in the most hilariously paired people that are Tom and (cousin) Greg since Chris and Paulie Walnuts.Succession doesn't mince words (or chicken hahahaha). Nothing on the script feels wasted. And the insults are ingenious. As long as Jesse Armstrong remains showrunner, this show will surprise us in the most insane of ways. The research shows (the writers' room is apparently asked to read the Financial Times everyday), and it adds to the authenticity of the show, one which I appreciate. I would also be stupid not to talk about the best original opening theme I have ever heard in any TV show. Nicholas Britell has made a masterful score which does not sound excessive at all. Much like in Mr Robot, the score amplifies the mood.If you're watching Succession, don't be thrown off by the first 2 episodes of the show (I actually like them). Give it time, because by the 6th episode you'll probably fall off your bed. And come season 2 (which I consider one of the greatest executions of anything in television history because it's flawless), you'll drop your jaw every 25-30 minutes of screentime, which is basically every halftime moment of an episode.Succession deserves every honor coming its way. HBO has landed another absolute winner in its roster, one that will likely age extremely well with a season or two and be compared to the other Golden Age dramas of this generation. Yes, by that, I mean shows like Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Leftovers, and maybe, just maybe, The Wire and The Sopranos. Good call on ditching Westworld for marketing this, HBO. This is arguably going to be my favorite deconstruction of capitalism right now.I can't wait for season 3 at all. I'm just going to rewatch season 2 till then. All the white kids fight for a kiss from daddy, and that might not sell the show a lot. But the fight spins into so many nuances it's hard to look away and just dismiss them as that.",

A lot of money was spent developing excellent sets, well-conceived location shots; a superb cast; talented directors. But despite all that, it's completely off. Just off. Because, weirdly, it feels as though it's being written by 16 year olds. The characters in the show aren't portrayals of credible adults, they're adults as conceived by kids. These adults have no sense of responsibility. They swear all the time -- the f-word always amuses them. Whenever an adult touches another, they all get hard, or hot. They drink like teenagers. They do drugs like teenagers. They talk like teenagers. They are, essentially, teenagers.Worse, however, is that these pretend adults, who are suppose to be running one of the largest media empires in the country and a major presidential political campaign, don't sound as though they have the slightest idea what they're doing: their business jargon all comes out of some Business 101 text book. It's worse than just bad, it's silly.Worst of all, however, is that all the adults are terrible people. Worse than terrible. They're all cruel, mean, vindictive, evil, and thoughtless, just as a raging teenager might portray his loathed parent. These are the worst people ever created for a television show.All in all, the program is compelling and fast, but only if you want to watch a juvenile world view. And an angry one at that.(Not even going to go into the insane plot mistakes, the characters who disappear, the actions that make no sense, the lack of continuity. Not even going there.)",

I've long considered myself a fan of Adam McKay's story telling, and I'm afraid I must disagree with those who've pronounced this as 'unwatchable'.\nFrom one sibling to the next, theirs is a cautionary tale of raising your children to be loathsome human beings, that attributable wealth can breed contentious offspring that will feast on the flesh of others while laughing at the horror left in their wake. That a spine isn't inherited, and weakness isn't easily overcome. \nIn this world, we witness the sowing of what they willfully reap- with repercussions meted out on a slow burn that may or may not bring casualties. \nI'm intrigued and can say without pause that this is a triumphant return to the greatness that once was HBO, and hopefully more to come, after the lackluster choices we've been witness to in the last decade or so from the likes of Girls, Vinyl, Rome, etc and more in keeping with some of the best television has to offer in Sopranos, 6FU, etc.\nCount me in on this one.

Every time somebody has something dramatic to say there is an establishing shot of them then a fast go-to quick zoom when they start talking...please stop, we get it, we know who is talking! This is sophomoric filmmaking and the easy way out as far as creativity, your script should be strong enough so you don't have to hold the viewers hand and push them in front of the person talking. Done well the appropriate zoom is important, here its almost comedic, feels like it was pulled out of a bag. The shaky camera, this technique is used to make the viewer feel like they are actually there, done right, subtly and sparingly it can add drama and inclusion to scene, done in excess and poorly it looks like a cheap TV drama, unfortunately in this show its the latter, it feels like you are in a disaster earthquake film. \nShots were all over the framing board and visually disjointed doing an Injustice to the actors, script and most important the viewers.I would have liked to review the actual show but I couldn't make it pass the cinematography. So an F on the camera work, DP yikes, editors yikes if this was done in post (editing) which it seems like it was because it was done so poorly (meaning key fames in effects can't replace human movement). Regardless it's the directors responsibility and anyone else who let this out the door, they know better. DP and editing I know you can be held hostage so if you wanted to do the right thing and couldn't I understand, peace be with you.To summarize, I don't write reviews but once in a blue moon, I'm not on a rant or trying to be mean I'm just tired of lazy film making being thrown in our face.

Get the picture?Quite simply, if you have ever liked a TV show at all, you will be hooked.LOST is a show about a plane crash on a mysterious island. 48 people survive, but the show centers around 14, all with secrets. At first, there is confusion. But as the show goes on, friendships develop, and we learn that there is more to the island than what it seems...The characters are fantastic--don't pay any attention to those who say the cast is so diverse it is clichéd, those are probably the same people who would have criticized it if it was all white.In short, watch.

I was seriously considering ditching my TV and cable subscription in favour of my computer screen and broadband Internet connection.Then along comes \"Lost\". I missed the first few episodes, but was able to catch up thanks to BitTorrent. Now I'm hooked. There are several things to like about this show, but here's a quick list:1) Outstanding, intelligent, layered writing. There are multiple mysteries here, and for every answer we get, more questions emerge.2) Rich, complex characters. Just when you think you've got a character pegged, you find out something new about them that's often surprising or even shocking. I'm enjoying watching the various relationships emerge and develop.3) Strong performances. This is a remarkable cast of mostly journeymen actors with a couple of newcomers, and they're all turning in star-making work. Even some of the cameos have featured recognizeable, talented actors (e.g. Mira Furlan, Victoria Hamel).4) A mysterious and fascinating setting. Of the four main story elements you learned in school, plot, character, theme, and setting, the latter is often the poor, neglected cousin. Not here. The island is dangerous, beautiful, creepy, and undeniably intriguing. It's like a character unto itself. Part of the fun of this show will be unravelling the Island's secrets.5) Thematic depth. This isn't just a soap opera on a desert island. There are rich metaphors and themes to be mined here, such as on the challenges of morality; on the nature of communities and civilization; on our relationship with nature/the environment; and on spirituality, even mysticism, as well.I'm grateful to see this show is a hit. Too often lately I've committed to a quality show early on (\"Wonderfalls\" being the most recent and much-lamented example) only to have a jittery network cancel it prematurely. I'm hoping \"Lost\" will have a long, successful run--if its creators, cast, and crew keep up the level of quality they've shown so far, I'm sure it will.",

This isn't \"CSI\" or \"Law and Order,\" where each week is a variation on the same theme. On \"Lost,\" you have a group of fascinatingly different, tragically flawed characters who must somehow learn to survive together, while at the same time trying to keep their secrets hidden. That's a method for disaster. After living together for a long time, the characters are going to find out it's impossible to keep their pasts a secret.Yes, there's a monster on the island.

The survivors of a plane crash are forced to live with each other on a remote island, a dangerous new world that poses unique threats of its own. after reading this your thinking how on earth can that be interesting? and heres your answer, every season SO FAR has always been full of surprises, your always questioning your self why did that just happened and what's gonna happen next each time, very unexpected thing's happen and the story goes on wonderfully SO FAR! The series just sucks you in, it's chilling and very addictive, everything from the wonderful creators and directing to the magnificent performances by the cast creates a very believable story. Lost is simply unbelievable, amazing, highly entertaining, top notch, t.v at it's best.How ever you want to put it.Lost beat's all other show's by a landslide. And if your hating or criticising Lost you don't know how to watch t.v or watch drama. Lost simply doesn't disappoint, you would think a series carrying on for so long can't keep getting better. But it does! It just keep's on flowing it's unlike anything you would ever think off. \"Every thing happens for a reason.\" And that is truly shown in the series. Eventually you will reach a point were all the clues and everything that's happened or being done adds up. You will feel and realise how the characters have changed and how and why everything is going on.The 10 minutes of excitement: You see something you didn't see coming, something major has happened to character or on the island. There's hope somewhere. You see a major twist that can or will change everything. You hear your thought's churn, you wonder what's gonna happen next. Your heart beating. The 30 minutes of brilliance: You see a flawless scenes, tension building, you hear wonderful music by Michael Giacchino. You see great flash backs, impressive acting. You see wittiness, chilling atmosphere, which then get's converted back into tension.Everyone has there show that they are addicted too, that they can't get enough of, that they admire every minute and can't wait for the next episode, That they talk about 24/7. Too me and many others it's this series. Lost. Once you start watching, you won't get enough. The creators did a flawless job. Lost is completely unique and original, you won't see anything like it. The clever idea of \"flashbacks and flashforwards\" and something major and different in every season sucks your thoughts. Would they ever make a series like \"LOST\"? Something so interesting and something you will always remember. It simply has stunned the world when it hit t.v. A new generation of dramatic/sci-fi. A instant classic before it reached out to the viewers.I'm sure you all heard of lost and it's 5 star reviews, and your annoying friend that won't stop telling you about it, so what's stopping you from watching?Every episode leads to something new and it just doesn't stop getting better and better, you get more interested as it goes along, you learn things that are on the island that you wouldn't even think off. The characters start to become very likable, and if your the critic type you would love to see Lost in further detail, things like how the relationship between characters develop and how they learn the ways to under look and take on challenges from the Island. All together it's a great drama and a flawless series. I guess we just all hope that lost will not have a downfall in the episodes to come and go to far.....so if you don't watch lost, read the comment from the top again and you should change your mind. Seeing is believing, so until you start watching you will never know .I strongly recommend this masterpiece of series: LOST!! start watching!!! You have not seen nothing until you watch LOST!!!",

Dominic Monaghan, on The Jonathan Ross show even confirmed it himself, after I had the thoughts. It totally put me off watching the series any further than a few episodes on series one.What am I talking about? Well the blatantly obviousness of money. ABC were unsure how Lost would go down, but it's been a big, huge hit. Dominic Monaghan confirmed on The Jonathan Ross show that the writers know how the show will end. They have an end story and it could of ended it in series 2 but because the show is so huge, ABC have said \"You can't end it now, we are making so much money out of this. We need to drag it out of 10 series\". And that is exactly why I stopped watching.The show if enjoyable yes. But when you realise that all the weirdness and oddness is simply ABC's choice, to drag the show out for as long as people like it, to make more money. You realise that most weird bits have no relation to the story at all and are fillers, it totally puts you off. Totally ruins the enjoyment of it. So I stopped watching.If you don't mind all this, you may like it. But I got sick of the filler episodes, clearly designed to drag the show out.",

The new series debuted with a full 60 minute story that establishes the characters very solidly, opens pathways for many story lines, and boasts an exceptional cast of fine actors. Here is hoping it makes it as an ongoing series, especially since it is not yet another crime drama! Not that Criminal Mains, The Mentalist, Without A Trace will lose their place among the best show on television, but with all the spinoffs on the crime shows, the available choices have been dwindling lately.SUITS is a lawyer show. Set in New York (captured, by the way, in beautiful cinematic vistas) it focuses on a very successful law firm, managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) who balances the talents of her two top lawyers, the smarmy Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) who is a control freak, and the very brilliant but egotistical Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht). There is a particularly appealing and very bright secretary Donna (Sarah Rafferty) and a beautiful paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markel) and last but certainly not least by any means there is Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) - a young lad who is extremely bright, has a photographic memory, dropped out of college because he took tests for fellow students and got caught, fell into marketing drugs by default for need of money so that he could pursue his dream of being a lawyer, and falls quite by accident into the role of being selected as associate to the brilliant but self absorbed Harvey Spector. This is the team of characters who are destined to provide fascinating substories as they interact.The dialogue (Aaron Korsh and Sean Jablonski) is clever, bright, snappy, unclichéd, witty, and helps define the complexities of the characters. The pacing is exceptional (directors Kevin Bray and John Scott) and the series has the appearance of a high-end movie - excellent cinematography, expansive development of story in well-selected locations - but most of all this is a cast that is worthy of attention every moment they are on camera. It will be interesting to watch how Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht grow into our psyches: both are exceptionally fine and provide a spectrum of the lawyer personality we haven't seen on a series before. This should be a major hit!Grady Harp",

Unfortunately the clever seems to have turned into everyday unspectacular. The characters are now just bumbling ants without direction and without any capacity for passionate relationships.

The characters are likable and, with the exception of \"Mike Ross,\" a page out of real life. I can guarantee you that there is not a single lawyer at a high power NYC law firm that didn't go to law school. Additionally, no lawyer as green as Mike would be given so much attention. Here is where I will cut the show some slack- without such deviations from the truth there would be no show.Some reviewers liken this show to House but with lawyers. Sure, there are some common elements surrounding Harvey being cold-hearted and cocky yet excellent as his job. But this is where I want to draw the distinction: characters like Harvey actually exist in this world (minus the likability). There are charming, proud, extremely competent, rude, driven, and ruthless lawyers in every major firm in every major city. At some point it becomes a requirement of the job. Doctor House meanwhile is too much of a self-destructive train wreck for my taste.If you want to get a glimpse into working at a high power law firm, an investment bank, or any other high stakes pressure-cooker job look no further. Keep the insane hours, lose the friendliness, and amplify the cockiness and voilà: a glimpse of reality.

What made the latter great was its unflinching (if somewhat biased) glance into the human psyche, the way it looked at the anxieties, the lies and the little betrayals that the characters on the show liked to sweep under the rug but that ended up coming back to haunt them, often in dramatic and life-threatening ways. That, and the contradictory and vulnerable characters the show placed at each other's mercy.\"Suits\", however, is not like that. It doesn't have any of the inquisitiveness and candor of \"House\". All we see on this show is a group of young, pretty, rich, high-powered yuppies who are too cool to care about anything. The main characters always get the last word, know the wittiest response, look the most elegant. Everyone \"gets it\" or ends up as a loser on the sidelines of the show. Basically, all the main characters (and most of the supporting characters) are the same. Of course, Mike is still a bit wet behind the ears and thus not quite as stylish as the other characters. But that's the only difference between him and the other protagonists.That's why it was impossible for me to care about anyone on the show. It's not interesting to me to follow the journey of people who excel at everything without showing any kind of depth or conflict. Of course, the characters on the show have their flaws, too: they are \"too committed to their work\", they are \"too straight-forward\", they \"can't keep their opinions to themselves\", etc.. In other words: they have exactly the character traits their job calls for. And we are supposed to accept these \"flaws\" as somehow adding complexity to the characters at hand?The show has some intelligent plot lines, that is true. I enjoyed the way the lawyers were trying to best each other, spinning the issues at hand around, looking for the little detail that could help them - it's an interesting show concept. Also, the acting is pretty good. But after 6 episodes, I grew so tired of the bland characters that I skipped to the middle of season 2 to see if there would be any character growth. There wasn't. The main characters were still the same as in the beginning.The boring characters are what kills this show for me. If I want to see effortless success, I can always watch my washing machine.

The story is centred around the firm's best lawyer, Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht), an egotistical, uncompassionate, charmingly witty Harvard graduate who will do whatever it takes to win – \"The best closer this city has ever seen\"; and his associate Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), an under-achieving compassionate genius with an eidetic memory who strikes lucky by having the opportunity to work at one of the highest profile legal firms even after being caught for attempted drug trafficking and without the required qualifications. The show follows both characters as they face different legal and personal challenges in each episode whilst maintaining the gregarious and quick-witted rapport between the two.The show offers plenty of variety besides the law by developing the relationships of many characters inside the firm, \"Pearson Hardman\", managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres), a career-minded powerful woman. Jessica must balance between her two best lawyers, a devious Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) and Harvey, whose relationship is filled with rivalry and playable banter, is certainly one to make you laugh. The show also follows the stories of the beautiful Rachel (Meghan Markel), a paralegal whose test anxieties are stopping her from fulfilling her ambitions of going to Harvard to study law and Donna (Sarah Rafferty) a smart, sexy secretary.Besides the two leading characters, Suits is balanced excellently with an ensemble cast filled with intriguing relationships and an original and sharp script combined with the beautiful backdrop of New York City to make this a thoroughly enjoyable TV show which I can't help but grin ear-to-ear from start to finish and I hope it continues its high standards for seasons to come.

Caveat: I write about media as my profession, and, again, I rarely take time out to write this kind of stuff because I have enough on my plate. But, SUITS has emerged as a private indulgence. Yes, it's an L.A. Law remake (and there are still issues with genre -- \"what does it want to be?\" is still a problem), but it's a much more self- conscious and playful show, and the writing is brilliant, evoking noir-like banter. After two years, and my original review, I am happy to see the show develop its women characters (and not overly sexualizing Jessica, like before, one of the most powerful African-American women characters on television) -- I like the new stylists' choices of making her stylish/sexy but not overly Ally MacBeal, such as the use of asymmetrical dresses/suits during episodes when she was in conflict with Harvey or Darby (nice homonym, by the way). But, what's the deal with all of the bags/purses? Professional women don't bring Hermes Birkin bags to every in-office conference (I think I have counted the number of purses in a shot, and it's kind of astounding, enough already with product placement). The \"Rachel\" character has also developed. I was a little worried about scene changes: those establishing pov shots that focused on Rachel's bootie, but then there was a funny complementary shot focusing on a woman looking at a man's bootie. Rachel is developing as a character; that said, the actress who plays her needs to eat a muffin, as she's tubercular these days. I keep expecting her, out of starvation, to fall over the copy machine. Still love the filmic banter (meta-cinematic references to film culture, super fun and opens up the show), and now it's not just btw Harvey and Mike, but is extending across the show/characters (even to Louis). And, yes, Louis. He's still a caricature, but he has pathos -- yes, he's a comic relief figure but also a person now. And, I think my favorite episode this season was the great Cat Trial, which made me laugh out loud in its surrealism. The show is now much more bifurcated, but in a good way. It attempts to explore legal culture (but it does not glorify such work, as it examines the economic determinism that runs against humanist ethics) but also has these really fun, outrageous, implausible fun sub-narratives that are about human empathy, struggles and, well, neuroses. And, what is legal culture but the expression of human neuroses? I like where it's going because I don't know where it's going, which is a rarity. That said, as a suggestion, I think it needs to exteriorize (beyond the lame Game of Thrones line) & open up the space of the firm. And, Mike Ross is now kind of in limbo. I still think he should go to law school and maybe now with Rachel (as a means of personal legitimization?). Could be some fun scenes of them being equalized in law classes.",

Instead each show became more typically an average soap opera where the main characters were routinely thrown into conflict with each other and starting keeping secrets and telling lies to each other. This is the staple diet of any soap you care to watch and the easiest way to create tension and drama. The love affair between Rachel and Mike was juvenile and it got to the point where I would fast forward when Rachel came into view - all she did was to complain about Mike and life in general. Finally I have to say that at the end of season 2 I lost any interest in Harvey, he seemed selfish and isolated and I could not understand his position at all.

There are few small spoons of something in the last episode of season 3, but it's pretty dumb. Everytime characters decide to do something, they actually don't do it most of the time. It's interesting how they made all characters actual filler because they have no idea how to move the plot and try to make sense with it and stuff that previously happened. I don't think I ever saw that. Adding even more dumb characters in season two and three didn't help that at all.Season 4 got greenlit somehow, apparently people are watching this, maybe. I can't wrap my head around it, the show is bad. I hatewatch it, maybe others are too.---Few episodes in of season 2 and I'm getting pretty annoyed wtih this show.Just like LOST, mysteries are piling up, but not one single resolution, hint of an answer and explanation or even a move in forward direction is presented. For Season 2, they just expanded all that by dumping much more people in it.While I can excuse first season slow burn and lack of any satisfying anwers - and I mean lack of ANY - the stuff they pulled in the last episode with various cliffhangers and possible revelations, just fell apart in episode one of this season.Almost anything that is happening is not important for the main plot. Character arcs are mostly empty, uninteresting. Those same characters act like most irrational, uninterested and dumbest people alive.Everything is tropey, boring and tempo of each episode is criminal. Just when you think something is going to happen, to propel story and plot forward - it ends. Then in the next episode it turns out it's nothing of importance and it just goes like that in circles. It's all filler.Even damn intro is lasting forever, eating time.Some shows have a overall arc that is just a backdrop for all the happenings in the show. Like Leftovers, and it works. Here however, there is really only one plot point of interest and everything else is unimportant filler and fluff. Yet they insist on that instead dealing with the main plot. Even things concerning the main plot are fed us via teaspoon in the worst, unsatisfactory way possible. Even then, time between those is pretty damn long time.I don't know if I'm going to finish season 2, but it's getting pretty frustrating. Which is a shame, because main plot is interesting, but I'm suspecting that except that main concept, they have no sensible or satisfying resolution and are just going to string us around until either show gets cancelled or we get some dumb, slapped on ending, just for the sake of ending it.For the time being, I can't recommend.",

And I know, most characters in horrors make bad decisions (I've seen the Progressive commercial).. but still!?Aside from that the overall tone feels off. Wouldn't it be better to keep the tension level on HIGH, like it was at the end of episode 1? Way too often the towns people act like they're living normal progressive lives with a bright future, and not as though any mistake at night means you die a horrible death along with your friends and family. Most if not all of them should be on the verge of a mental break down!I can see the producers are trying to make a statement that people can endure and BE KIND in bad situations, but this is supposed to be HORROR, not a case study on humanity.",

The director is a big problem as they do things like have the little boy get a severe leg injury. The kid isn't horrible but he can't use a crutch or limp to save his life. Not really the kids fault, he hasn't built up the coordination to do it. But how is it that episode after episode we watch him limp on the wrong leg, use the crutch on the wrong side and or leg? At some point don't you go another direction? Why couldn't the mother (who is possibly the worst actor in the show) be the one with the injury? Anyone but the kid who can't do it? Then you have the boss lady of Colony house. She somehow manages to remain angry and fat for years even though the food is 90% plants. She seems to believe that the loudest person in every situation is the correct one which is almost never the case in life. More lazy writing, everyone who ever holds a knife and gets touched or grabbed automatically spins and \"accidentally\" stabs the person behind them! This is used several times- sooooooo lazy and unlikely. The Sheriff, his son and his son's girlfriend along with the paramedic do a good job for the most part, but it's easy to see they won't ever resolve how to get home because that would be the end. They are going to milk this until it dies- the ending will either be just fading to black with no answers or a planned ending which this does not appear to have. My recommendation is to watch a few of the 1st series, then wait to see how they tie it up. Why invest yourself in a series that appears to be going nowhere?",

I don't know if CBS is trying to keep this show a secret or if their marketing guys just fell asleep at the wheel but this show is fantastic.The characters, that seem exaggerated at first, are actually believable if you have ever been to a physics conference of any kindor for that matter any comic-con. These \"geeks\" make up an ever growing segment of our population and I think it is wonderful that they finally have a show to call their own. Perhaps I am biased because of my own nerd tendencies but I have had arguments exactly like the ones in this show with my own clique of nerdy friends. To anyone who ever enjoyed math class watch this show and get your friends who didn't like math class to watch too because if they get you they will get this show.",

Somebody came to a question \"How many nerd TV shows did we had?\", answer was clear, none.In the world where twitter and Facebook represent social life of the world, not just people who created it (colloquially named nerds) its now acceptable to have such a show. For me this is an insult produced by the marketing management of the studio/TV station.If you want to watch a truly funny TV show you would see The IT Crowd, a great British comedy, written and directed as to really show the \"nerds\" not as a naive, stupid, limited and socially crippled, but as people devoted to their work.TBBT is created without simple sitcom humor so it brings little to the screens.I am so sorry for the people who didn't had an opportunity to watch a real sitcom like Frasier or real TV show like NYPD Blue, which in their time really gave people something to watch, not just entertaining their brain with dumb blonds and fast-paced exchange of scientific words supported by crispy nice eye candy of sets and shots.Character of Leonard is so appalling and moronically-conniving that the character of Penny is truly his mate.Only one, that is ever worth of this show and screen time is Sheldon.Rating of 8.7/10 gives no input on the quality of the true sense of the show. I am so disappointed by the TV production in last 11 years that I cant find anything truly worth watching today.Frak Michel Bay, frak JJ Abrams, frak Leonard (TBBT).",

The important thing is, the standard sitcom story lines feel new for the first time in decades, mainly because the mile-a-minute dialogue now comes with gloriously incomprehensible techno-babble and high-level jargon that could send Kissinger screaming from a room.It comes down to essentially this. Spot-on writers and directors handle a spot-on cast in spot-on situations. Those of you who are turned off of shows by audience laughter, it adds a much-needed level of reality to this surreally present crowd-pleaser.

Their introduction also ruined other character's story lines. Sheldon never would've ended up dating a girl the way they wrote him in with Amy. Howard was perfect when he was the overly horny nerd, and him marrying and settling down with Bernadette ruined his character. They couldn't figure out how to keep Raj the silent character so they made him talk to girls and even date as well. Which was pathetic writing. Making Penny fit in with all of them ended up removing the hot, dumb blonde girl around nerds effect that made the show great to begin with. Now, Penny doesn't stand out as the hot girl against the nerds because they stopped writing her like that and just made it more like Friends instead of the clashing personalities dynamic that made this show good.",

            "review": "Review of Series One:PEAKY BLINDERS has been lauded by many as the BBC's answer to the likes of US-made fare like BOARDWALK EMPIRE; it's a show chronicling life for Birmingham-based gangsters in the 1920s, and with a couple of decent actors in the leads it looks like pretty much a dead-set win. Indeed I've just heard that it's been renewed for a second series, so it must have done something right, but I'm afraid it left me utterly cold.The problem I had with the show is that it just feels so drawn-out, padded and predictable. Whole sub-plots and story lines are dragged out over six episodes when they should have been cleared up in a single episode or two maximum. The likes of GAME OF THRONES have the pacing just right so that the viewer doesn't get bored. Yes, there's merit in slow-burning atmosphere and character-building, but I just didn't like or care about anybody involved; the old Catherine Cookson adaptations of the 1990s did this sort of thing remarkably and PEAKY BLINDERS never comes close.Instead we get one clichéd scene after the next, complete with all the ridiculousness the BBC can throw at you: ultra-slow-motion in the hands of a hack director, and modern-day music to make it seem \"cool\" but which in reality takes you out of the story every time. Cillian Murphy, an actor I've loved in pretty much everything since RED EYE, is surprisingly dull and one-note; he under-plays everything to the point of monotony, and I found myself hating him for a lot of the running time. Sam Neill is excellent, but he can't account for everything, while Annabelle Wallis is vacant, seeming to think that lurking around with her mouth hanging open constitutes acting when it doesn't.Review of Series Two:The second series of PEAKY BLINDERS is a slight improvement over the first, mainly down to the ramped-up levels of gore and carnage that have clearly been included to appeal to the BOARDWALK EMPIRE and GAME OF THRONES crowd. This series concentrates on the Blinders gang's attempts to expand in the London market, with variable results.The production values are better this time around, and the production has a generally well-made air to it. Unfortunately, there are still hulking problems with it, not least the continued decision to include loud, jarring modern music to accompany the scenes. There are so many shots of characters walking in slow motion with fires or explosions in the background accompanied by this soundtrack that you feel like you're watching a music video at times. It's all very dated and mid-'90s in feel.The main problem with the show, however, is the lack of decent characterisation. The characters are one-note cardboard cut-outs throughout, and to make matters worse, none of them are sympathetic. Murphy just sits behind his desk the whole time, and Tom Hardy's scenery-chewing attempts do little to improve things. Why they brought back two used-up characters (Neill and Wallis) I don't know, because their story arcs are over and both are equally lifeless. A pivotal scene between Neill and McCrory is one of the most excruciating things I've ever sat through. It's the quality of writing that lets PEAKY BLINDERS down, and I just hope they improve on things in the next series; who knows, I might actually start enjoying it then!Review of Series Three:Sadly, series three of PEAKY BLINDERS is a step back to the disjointed nature of series one. It's even more of a case of style and substance here, and I would say that this is the most shallow series yet. For at least half of the running time it feels like one big music video, with the lazy use of loud, modern music to put across a sense of mood when really the scriptwriter should be doing that.The six episodes of this series feel remarkably busy and yet very little actually happens. There are a great deal of new characters in support, including the welcome Paddy Considine as a sinister priest, but none of them actually do very much. Murphy remains a vacuum at the centre of the show, never seeming to develop his character very much beyond the most basic elements. In fact, the only time this picks up is in the very last episode, with intense cutting between three separate story lines adding to the excitement no end. A shame the rest of the series didn't feel like this.",

The first is it isn't set in London. Why is this a good thing? It's a nice change of scene, change of accent and culture. Peaky Blinders give you a great sense of what Birmingham was like at the time. The second reason it stands out is it is told from the criminals point of view. You get a feeling of belonging to the Peaky Blinders and despite all the terrible acts they carry out there is a fundamental decency somewhere deep down in Thomas Shelby.The cinematography is great, the storyline is great the only thing I would challenge is the accents. They sway in and out of the Birmingham accent but its a decent attempt and probably unnoticeable to anyone not from Birmingham.

Every shot is either like a music video or a fashion magazine spread in period costume. The characters are props - lifeless mannequins. None of them feel like actual people, nor are they meant to. The actors here are all good, but they have nothing to do but pose. We're just supposed to be dazzled by how cool they look and sound. The fact that so many viewers seem to think this show is gritty and realistic is a depressing commentary on how on we as a society can no longer tell the difference between the fake and the authentic (and how little we care about the difference).

Negative critics of the show seem to have overlooked the fact that this is the first time ever that this side of British gangster-lore has been documented. Off hand, the only thing that comes close to this style of gangland depiction is the first half of Once Upon A Time in America, were we see the heroes struggling to escape the deprivation of ghetto life. This is where Peaky Blinders stands out from the typical run-of- the-mill crime show. There is nothing glamorous about being a gangster in this world. As far from LA Confidential glitz as you can get, the viewer is forced to get down and dirty in the horseshite-ridden streets of post WW1, working-class Birmingham.The attention to detail, the costumes, the sets, particularly the Lee family dwellings, have all been created to the highest standard. As is the quality of acting, which is undeniably as good as you'll find in any prime-time British drama.Even though people on this particular forum have not had much positive feedback about the series, believe me, the connoisseurs of this genre have been very impressed thus far. Furthermore, the show seems to be building up to climatic ending rather than simply documenting a day in the life of a Peaky Blinder. The more observant viewers will see subtle 'tie-ins' between each situation and be able to follow the flow of events without obvious prediction. This is what the drama audience thrives on to stimulate analytical debate after each episode.If it doesn't get rave reviews, I will be disappointed but not surprised, as Peaky Blinders has all the makings of an artistic and timeless cult series, possibly appealing more to purists and true fans of the cult/gangster genre.

Please push this internationally, let's keep it on our screens and see it develop. This period in UK history is rich with trauma, upheaval and change, the backdrop of industrial Birmingham is new and trumps the well trodden New York, Chicago, and London gangster scenes.

But a policeman arriving at the city is looking to stop this family, but it's not easy. It will also be noticeable the segregated fight of ghettos like Italians, gypsies, local gangsters and Jews. Peaky Blinders is an excellent gangster drama full of rich, interesting and diverse characters. The fact that Peaky Blinders is a crime series can give the impression that characters are macho men. But this is not true. The series also incorporates many powerful female characters. It has an excellent cast and script. Thomas is a character who uses his strategic intelligence and applies violence to his own ends without hesitation. The film music is the highlight of the series along with Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy. The director does resort to a modern soundtrack that reflects the fiction.It is estimated that one episode of the series is worth 1 million and 1.5 million euros. This means a rich, detailed and beautiful work of art. Constantly supporting the narrative structure visually, Peaky Blinders often touches upon the working conditions of the working class in Birmingham. Peaky Blinders, with a color scale that chooses to contrast between pale blues and greens, and contrasts with the shades of red, makes the strongest manifestation of emotions in the midst of this unknown, while attributing a distinct obscurity to Birmingham's misty air. Also, the visual effects used from time to time are quite clever. The visual effects used are also quite compatible with the historical theme of the series.Peaky Blinders makes each episode a separate action and drama. It's a breathtaking series where you can see the rise of Peaky Blinders. 9/10",

Before long I'd bought the first season DVD boxset and sprouted a 1920s military haircut ... Unfortunately the sheen and style of the series wears off eventually .. About halfway through season 2, I suddenly became aware of the complete absence of any kind of compelling narrative .. Evidently things happened, but by now the monotone delivery and haircuts felt like they had nowhere to go .. I read an interview with the writer, Steven Knight, in which he boasted about how he'd already got nearly a dozen seasons written, and could reel off a script in an afternoon .. Well, great work if you can get it, but a stark contrast to the year-long team-writing process behind a single season of Breaking Bad .. Where Breaking Bad creates a narrative worthy of a Russian novel, and The Sopranos shows profound insight into the human condition, an episode of Peaky Blinders feels like 10 minutes of hastily scrawled script, padded out with brooding shots of people smoking in dark rooms, walking in slow motion, and generally loving the smell of their own farts over a one-dimensional selection of 90s and 00s indie .. In fact it's astonishing to me that an episode of The Sopranos and Peaky Blinders run to about the same length, as where each episode of The Sopranos feels like a self-contained movie; an episode of Peaky Blinders has less script than the average Jay-Z video ..

Nominally the head of the family is the oldest brother, Arthur, but the real brains, ambition and drive in the organisation lies with Tommy, the second oldest. He will carve out an empire for himself that will stretch beyond Birmingham. This with the aid of his family and his gang, the Peaky Blinders.Superb drama, created and written by Steven Knight. Gritty, realistic, intriguing and highly entertaining. Some great machinations, subterfuges, plots and counter-plots plus a good amount of action and human drama. Think The Sopranos set in the UK in 1919.Some very clever storylines and plot developments. They sometimes threaten to become implausible and random (especially as the series goes on) but have a way of fitting together and all making sense at the end.Great work by the main performers: Cillian Murphy, Helen McCrory, Paul Anderson, Sophie Rundle and Joe Cole. The secondary/guest performances include some big names: Sam Neill, Tom Hardy, Aiden Gillen, Adrien Brody, Noah Taylor. Tom Hardy is the pick of the bunch, as Alfie Solomons.Great soundtrack too. Though set in the early-20th century, the music is mostly rock, and it works. Despite being anachronistic, the music works, giving the series an edgy feel. It starts with the theme track - Nick Cave's excellent 'Red Right Hand', a song that seems to fit Tommy Shelby perfectly. It continues with the scene-specific music and includes some great tracks. For example, in one episode alone you have Radiohead's 'Climbing Up The Walls', Joy Division's 'Atmosphere' and Black Sabbath's 'War Pigs'.In addition, the show went out on a high, while it was still quality viewing. By Season 5 cracks were starting to appear: the plot in Season 5 was a bit loose and unfocused and ends rather clumsily, compared to previous seasons. Still great, but not as good as previous seasons and a sign that it had run its course.The worry then was that Steven Knight would just phone it in for a few seasons to milk more money out of it and just end up ruining the legacy of the show.

Add to that shots of characters parading into a room, with an air that they are the coolest people alive, like a teen given better clothes and a better hair cut on the first day of school - that is also really trying my patience. If I were asked what character recently portrayed on film annoyed me most I'd have a hard time thinking of anyone else but Arthur; if I was a Peaky Blinder I'd shoot him myself. But this is perhaps due to a good character, played by a good actor, that is irritating. Above all though, the vast majority of the music irritates me; could they not blend music of the time while retaining Nick Cave's intro and randomly chosen outros? Or how about the cliche parts where Tom never meets a woman that isn't ready to drop their panties for him - is this something that was borrowed from that awful show Entourage?

Firstly that we're not being overlooked for London, Manchester or Liverpool, and we're being allowed our own history, which is interesting and colourful.At first glance the downstairs of the Shelby house looks too big to be the ground floor of a terrace, and people seem to be using their front doors far too often which, since there seems to be a significant amount of 'respect' being shown and rules being followed, it irks me that this protocol's being ignored. That said, it does look better to have the character using the front door.My other issue is accents. In fairness, for the most part people are doing an amazing job - most real Brummy accents do not sound like the caricature most people think of, and this is being respected by the actors with only the occasional slip... except for Aunt Polly. Helen McCrory is a fine actress - a mistress of the Brummy accent she isn't. Her performance is making up for it however.The Jamaiacan preacher amused me; as pointed out by another reviewer this actor is Benjamin Zephaniah: B'ham local and poet. Jamaica did send help over for WWI, so it's not impossible that several men stayed. He is a wonderful reminder that Birmingham has always been a hub for migration - even more so after WWII.Sam Neill's performance is amazing.So far the series is not just telling an interesting story, it's telling elements of Brummagem's history and present in a subtle and interesting way. I hope it continues.",

Titus Welliver is the perfect Bosch, the rest of the cast are just as brilliant and the writing and production are both spot on. The story line is in fact two Bosch books woven into one and it has been done very cleverly. Bosch fans have been waiting for twenty years for this character to be put onto film but for me, it was worth the wait. I would dearly love to see this made into a complete series. Titus Welliver is as brilliant as always and has the tormented look behind his eyes that any Bosch fan would expect to see. He may not physically resemble Harry but that is soon forgotten.

Also the use of slang and police lingo isn't always the easiest thing to understand if you're not familiar with it. That said Bosch is just quality. The cast is just perfect, all actors are very believable in their roles, the stories are addictive to follow, so yes I'm sad Bosch is finished.

The scene settings around LA make me want to go back and visit all the places i missed on my holiday there! My only criticism of this pilot is that stories from 3 books were used to weave into one story about a serial killer.

I hope that quits because Michael Connolly wrote with many more words and expressions other than the repeated use of the bomb. Good stories do not need to be inundated with vulgarity. Yes, he did use it on occasion, but only on occasion. Some of the dialog was low and difficult to follow so I will have to watch it again. I read both books, The Concrete Blonde and City of Bones and I am fascinated that the pilot should be a combination of the stories. I am assuming that should the series continue then they will fork off and get more into depth. Each story was very good, especially The Concrete Blonde. I like the idea that Michael Connolly is hands-on with this production so the integrity of his books is maintained. Like I stated earlier, I think the writers can deliver more dialog without resorting to vulgarity so much. I realize that these are cops and the language can get rough, but Connolly gets the toughness across without the constant use of vulgarity. Sorry if I keep on that same theme, but honestly, that is my biggest complaint for the pilot. Otherwise, I would have rated it a 10.",

I was in a way wondering if I was just wasting my time and watching a series that would fall short of everyone's expectations and just flop, like so many other TV series do nowadays.

The shots are smart and intriguing, yet still simple and not too overdone. The music is also outstanding. There are times when it is quirky and funny, there are times where it is tragic and sad yet epic, and then there are also the times when it is intense and mysterious.Fargo is mysterious, intense, funny (at times), tragic and just simply plain awesome!

So far, the only thing the series and the film do have in common is the title and the (fake) premise that both are - allegedly - based on true events that happened somewhere in Minnesota.The writers (and the actors!) do a great job in creating new characters that are as strange and somewhat over the top as most of the iconic Coen creations we've come to love over the years - and Billy Bob Thornton's 'Lorne Malvo' (from season 01) has the potential to reach cult status. Watching bad situations get worse as bad decisions lead to even worse ones and the lives of ordinary people spiral violently out of control is - I shamefully admit - a lot of fun to watch, and it's told here with such a wicked sense of humor that I've so far enjoyed every minute of it.The cast so far has been outstanding (this is an anthology series, so each new season will have its own cast and a new storyline) and the production values - especially the cinematography - are fantastic. Now whether 'Fargo' will appeal to a larger audience despite its quirky characters and non-mainstream look the way a show like 'Breaking Bad' did remains to be seen, but I would strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys black comedies in general as well as pretty much anything the Coens ever did.

I loved his air & nuanced performance. Then comes Martin Freeman, out of the neighborhood Sherlock sets, as that jittery underachiever who has a nagging wife. Things start to climb up when Freeman's character bumps into his high-school friend. Next, he meets Thornton's character & boom!

What follows next is as horrendous as the last minutes of the film. One after another, the thrills catch up with our heart's pumping pace as the characters grow out of their shells and reveal grave, suppressed expressions. It reflects human psychology brilliantly and in just the last 20 minutes. We feel sad, funny, pity, excited - for the images on- screen are brilliantly written. Music is very supportive.Yes, this is better than the complex True Detective. It is hard-hitting, folks and what more could a dark crime plot ask for a setup than Minnesota.

In Season 1 an insurance salesman accidentally hires a hitman to kill the man who has been bullying him all his life. In Season 2 a covered-up hit-and-run has major repercussions. In Season 3 a family feud over a stamp leads to a case of mistaken identity and several murders. In Season 4 two crime gangs feud over territory.Brilliant...for the first two seasons. I was initially sceptical of this series, thinking it was just a serialised version of the Coen Brothers' superb film of the same name. Turns out it's not, but it does have a lot in common with the movie, and this is a good thing.Creator Noah Hawley manages to capture the atmosphere and central concept of the movie without copying the movie. The plots are different to the movie but have the same pattern: a minor incident/decision that, through misunderstanding and bad luck, escalates into something massive, involving multiple murders. There's the white, cold visual aspect to the movie (being set in Minnesota in winter) which leads to a brooding, desolate feel to the series. Plus, there's the dark Coenesque humour. All this, without the Coens having any creative input into the series: they're executive producers, and nothing more.This was especially true in Season 1. The season was so true to the feel of the movie I was sure the Coen brothers had a major hand in it (they didn't). Add in a superb performance by Billy Bob Thornton as the psychopathic Lorne Malvo and Season 1 was off-the-charts brilliant.Season 2 was less intriguing than Season 1 and had a less-tight plot, but had more action. It builds up to this action though and the pacing is superb, building like an avalanche. The last few episodes are absolutely frenetic and riveting. While largely an independent season, the links to characters in Season 1 make this even more interesting. Only downside: the UFOs. They seemed rather gimmicky, added nothing to the story and didn't help the tightness of the plot.Season 3 marked the down-turn of the series. It has some good passages of play, some interesting characters and a wonderful tie-in with Season 1 but is definitely not in the same league as the first two seasons. The plot is far-fetched, truly testing the series' \"This is a true story\" line. Quite clumsy and disjointed at times, with sub-plots that add nothing except to take up time, a cartoonish villain (and one of the most dentally-unhygienic characters of all time) and plot developments that don't always make sense.It also feels a bit unoriginal: the \"police officer who sees the full picture but is hindered by the incompetence of their boss\" angle was covered in Season 1.Throw in some David Lynch-like sequences (often involving Ray Wise, who starred in Twin Peaks) and the season has a style-over-substance feel to it.Overall, Season 3 is watchable but is a major disappointment after Seasons 1 and 2.Season 4 is even worse. It started well enough, with an interesting and intriguing setup, but the writers clearly didn't know where to take everything. There's far too many characters and sub-plots and the pace is pedestrian, resulting in an unfocused, meandering, seemingly interminable season.The writers' keenness to draw things out and lack of ideas is no more demonstrated in Episode 9, an episode that closes off one sub-plot but takes an entire episode to do it when the actual substance of the episode would have taken at most 10 minutes. Plus they throw in heaps of Coenisms to appear reverential and arty and appeal to fans of the original Fargo when all they are doing is padding out the episode. It's also quite ironic, as Season 4 feels nothing like the original film, the remainder of the series or a Coen Brothers production. It's not even set in Minnesota!Season 4 is also not helped by Chris Rock being cast in the lead role. He's a decent comedic actor but here lacked the gravitas for the role.When Season 5 was released I was first surprised that I existed, as it had been three years since S4, and then hesitant to watch it, figuring the show had had its day. When I did watch it I was pleasantly surprised. The season is a decent return to form with much of what made the movie, S1 and S2 back: the intelligence , humour, Coenesque plot, characters and dialogue. Plus, the casting and performances have lifted with Juno Temple being quite the revelation in the lead role.It's not perfect though: the Minnesotan folksiness is overdone, some of the characters are cartoonish and there's a fair bit of filler, largely in the middle episodes. Still, at least it looks like the show is roughly on the right track after losing its way for two seasons.Season ratings: Season 1 10/10 (can I go full Spinal Tap and give this an 11/10? It deserves such a score), S2 10, S3 7, S4 5, S5 8.5.",

From then on I couldn't forget it, I missed it. I started watching several shows later, but nothing came close to BB. I went on a search for such exciting crime dramas and then I saw few people on reddit talk about Narcos and Fargo (most of them) to experience something similar. At first, I googled them and decided to watch Narcos as Google knowledge graph mentions Fargo as a comedy series. So, yeah Narcos was enthralling, but didn't really feel 10/10 especially with too much Spanish. Then I decided to give a try on Fargo and boy oh boy! It's simply sensational.Season 1: The first episode itself left me exuberant. This Martin Freeman guy, right from the day I saw him as Bilbao Baggins, everything he does impresses me and in Fargo there's nothing less. And the others were excellent too, especially Billy Bob Throtton, that man is really one hell of an actor. He is an assassin, every scene of him is jaw dropping with some chills. All in all, Season 1 of Fargo was really the one I was waiting for these whole 6 months and I didn't want to end this beautiful experience, so I immediately decided to watch Season 2.Season 2: Everyone who watched season 1 will have some idea about how season 2 will go on. It opened off very well and the first episode here too ends dramatically. The next 2 episodes were slow-paced and I thought this might turn out like True Detective Season 2 as it couldn't really recreate the magic of the first season (just my opinion). So, right when I thought it's sinking, it just gets better and better from episode 4. There won't be a moment you could take your eyes off till the last minute of the season finale. I'm glad they renewed it for the next season and I really can't wait for that.The music utilized over the two seasons is absolutely mind blowing, the way it relates to each and every scenario is just spectacular. Along with this awesome music, the outstanding piece of poetry depicts the ongoing lives of the people in Fargo. The direction part is really masterful and you can clearly see that in the second season\". It has few flaws but if you're just looking for some real piece of art then Fargo is a must watch.Update: Ok, it's sad to say that this amazing show went downhill later. Season 3 for me was 7/10 but at least very Fargoish but Season 4 is pathetic and should be ignored.",

Thornton, Plemons, Martin Freeman, Timothy Olyphant, Nick Offerman, etc... great actors have the ability to draw you into their character and make you care so you have to see what becomes of them. Chris Rock can get on stage and make me laugh - he cannot become a different character I subconsciously emotionally invest in and want to know more about. He's always Chris Rock saying lines somebody wrote for him to say.\nThis isn't the movie Grown Ups, or Good Hair, this is a serious show with heavy drama, Midwest racial history and a delivered at slow pace - you need real actors to suck the audience in so we care so much about the characters we're anxious to see what happens to them next.\nI gave it two episodes, but near the end of the second episode I felt like I was enduring the show, not enjoying it.

Sometimes it's even stupid, thinking that making one of the characters fart and throw up is going to inject some humor. Is this humor written by a 5 year old? Even my son finds fart jokes ridiculous. The acting is bad. Chris Rock is like a zombie and the big Italian actor who plays Gaetano over acts every scene with his ridiculous eye rolls. It's impossible to connect to any of the characters, they're just too many of them and no time to do a character introduction and build up.

This is an anthology series that was inspired by the 1996 film where each season follows a new murder story in some Midwest town with a different cast every season. It has the same feel, style, dark humor, unpredictability, etc as the film did. It has the feel of the Coen brothers but creator Noah Hawley definitely puts his own stamp on it.

Maybe i've just seen too many movies, but i've seen this all before. And i think what a lot of ppl like about this show is the norm in korean cinema. But most casuals have never watched a korean movie (if so, you're missing out, only thing that comes close to hollywood-level quality)i mentioned it in my title, but if you loved this series and are shocked by my low rating, please please please watch oldboy (not the american remake). It's superior in every way imaginable and an amazing movieoverall, this was an okay show. I was really into it at first, but it seemed to decline after the halfway point. By the end, i was feeling minimal impact from the big moments, and during the last episode i just wanted it to finish. There's a lot of good here, but many negatives as well. See below.Things that bothered me (without spoilers)-a scene that could have been really cool but they full-on strobe lighted it so you couldn't see anything-a ridiculously annoying female character (the older one), biggest offense is the eye-rolling bathroom scene-some really questionable decisions, some to the point of angering me-characters asking moronic questions or being outraged at things that they can't possibly still be outraged aboutthe games start out creative with skill, talent and strategy involved, but become random and filled with luck-the laughable acting and dialogue for all of the english scenes. This is the norm for asian cinema, but that doesn't mean it can always be forgiven. It was AWFUL. Can't they hire any experienced american actor? Or an english dialogue correspondent?-i like when a movie is the right kind of weird, the kind that makes it feel unique and adds character.

So much is wrong with this series, yes, the whole idea behind it, that I hardly know where to start. But I'll try. The purely cinematic criticism first: The character development is ad hoc, in rapid succession and hardly comprehensible. The character development from the failed and disliked clown to the moral hero does not work and is wrapped in a bad script. The supporting characters are just vehicles and not much else. Scattered in to show humanity, friendship or criminal energy and ruthlessness here and there, they are ultimately not figures in themselves. The cinematography is okay, but far too obsessed with a disgusting aesthetic, which is so full of wealth, greed and hedonism that it is not the renunciation of such anti-values, but their celebration. The music / the score are completely irrelevant and immature. They have no influence on the film. The script has as many gaps as a Swiss cheese and storylines go untold. The actors are sometimes like that, but all in all they tend to be in the lower range of the theatrical talent factory. They often only convey one, and when the going gets tough, maybe two or three qualities that the script exploits like wood engravings. Aside from these obvious aspects, however, the worst thing about this entire series is its game of hide-and-seek. The producers and creators of the series pretend that they are telling a parable about wealth, unscrupulousness, greed for money and, in the ultimate end, a moral story about ethics, humanity and humanism, but aim at a target group that is not aimed at them in the same breath Interested in topics. Instead, the show should (and will be) driven to success by a target group that is fascinated by the sadism, the ruthlessness and the immeasurable wealth of a brutal game of chance. The last episode underlines this ridiculousness impressively. A game of double standards and also pure greed for money takes place here. Artistic? Love for the medium of film? Or an affection for pop culture? None of it. I have a hard time expressing how much I hate this series because the disgust at the partying reactions takes my breath away.

The show's title and incredibly top line plot probably sound good on paper, but the writing and awkward acting falls embarrassingly flat.I think it's worse noting that I also really love Seth Rogen.

I think he is a figment of my imagination, or perhaps he is possibly actual proof that this world must in fact be a simulation, the matrix as it were, where Seth rogan's existence is a clue to programmers' mistakes in designing this simulation, for he cannot be a real person, he cannot be actually paid actual money to keep popping up in mindless pointless mind-rotting drivel.",

Therefore, it saddens me to see her paired with Seth Rogan, who has a very limited range as an actor. He made a splash 20 years ago as a slacker, pot-head character with a heart of gold. 20 years on, he is still playing the same character, and now it's just sad and sort of pathetic. He is even less believable as a potential love interest. He appears to me to be asexual. Every time he is supposed to play a love interest he comes across as more of a platonic friend than a sexual being capable of romancing a women into bed.This movie is saved by Byrne, but it's not enough. There are very few laughs here, and laughing and mugging for the camera does not guarantee that the viewers will be laughing along. I can think of 20 comedic actors that could have saved this movie, but for some reason producers keep casting Rogan in romantic comedies. It's not working and based on how few reviews there are on this page, it is an indication that the public has stooped watching him.",

The first three episodes that launched today are super relaxing and a perfect way to kick your feet up after a long day at work! The only complaint would be that the supporting characters don't really have much of a voice at the moment and I suppose that's perfectly fine as the main focus is on the dynamic between the two leads. It would be super cool if the characters do live up to the title of the show and remain strictly platonic because to be honest there are hardly any shows, comedy or otherwise that feature strong male/female friendships.

If you're not into the Seth Rogen brand of humour you might actually be surprised by this performance which shows a more mature Seth Rogen who's still able to pull out some genuinely funny moments of comedy when necessary. In terms of exploration of adulthood, don't expect anything too deep but everything is flowing so smoothly that I ended up watching one episode after the other over two days.Will (Seth Rogen) just got out of a divorce and is a owner of a brewery while Sylvia (Rose Byrne) is a stay-at-home mom of three kids who's clearly bored with her life, they both end up reconnecting after spending a few years apart. It's a light and entertaining Friday night watch with some good performances all-around. When Rose Byrne channels her inner comedic side she can be effortlessly hilarious and it's almost as if Seth Rogen brings out the best of her which allows her to unleash her wild side.I got attach to them pretty quickly thanks also to the writing which is not flashy but can be clever at times. It wins you over with the smaller moments that speaks volume. Maybe it's because I just hit my 30's or maybe it's because I always liked Seth Rogen, but this resonated with me without saying I was emotionally moved by the series it does get you hooked with the blend of drama and comedy, all thanks to Byrne and Rogen's charms and wits.I just think this works without being special or ground-breaking, it immediately becomes some sort of comfort food. In some ways, this might've benefited from the whole season dropping the same day but the first three episodes will be releasing on May 24th. It might lose some people along the way with the week-to-week format. By the end of the series, I was a bit underwhelmed by the finale, it left me wanting more.

Both main characters, especially Sylvia, are amazing. The final episode and the flashbacks of good moments between Will and Sylvia were lovely. This show will probably last for three seasons or more; they just need to improve the side characters because it's sometimes tough to watch when Sylvia and Will are not together.Overall, it's a good, light comedy show with nice conversations and great romantic tension.

So, how do these two middle-aged adults deal with their current issues? By rekindling their old friendship and behaving like teenagers.Maybe you'll find that cute and funny. Maybe that's your thing. Or maybe you'll find both these characters so inane, infuriating, and painfully self-absorbed that you'll want to put your foot through the screen, as I did. Your reaction to this show will depend almost entirely on your Seth Rogen-tolerance level. Full disclosure: I am a fan. Through the late noughties and early 2010s he contributed immensely to a handful of film comedies that defined the era. However, Rogen as a petulant man-child in cargo pants and flip-flops in his 20s may have been amusing, but a fortysomething with THAT demeanour, in THAT wardrobe and with THAT laugh? Torturous.Also, what in the name of Dick Van Dyke's Chirpee Cockernee is going on with Rose Byrne's accent?! It flies back and forth between the northern and southern hemispheres more often than a disorientated swallow. Her unwillingness to face any of the issues in her life and her infantile behaviour with her husband's co-workers almost allow her to surpass Rogen on the unlikeability scale.I found it impossible to root for these characters. Normally I adore a TV show or a film that focusses on flawed characters with negative personality traits, but it needs to be better written, it needs to be engaging and it needs to be funny... for the love of God Almighty it needs to be funny.I positively loathed it.",

It is *dark*, but there are certainly moments that approach the limits of any sort of television style format.The ending of \"Rick Potion #9\" is just amazing. Likewise, the end of \"M. Night Shaym Aliens\".The strength of the show is just how amoral Rick may be; but there is a strong attachment to the \"many universes\" hypothesis within the show. Philosophers have long debated the moral implications of \"many universes\" ( while realizing it's a bit sophomoric and nerdy ) ; \"Rick and Morty\" picks at this as its stock in trade. Morty is our avatar, and works in that capacity extremely well.The essential dyad at the center - the title characters - interact little with the more peripheral characters, who have mainly been used in B plots. This shifts of course, and with these sorts of shows they will always mix this for plot gain. There's a rich enough set of characters to provide ample space. The interaction between Rick and Morty hoists a bit from classic propaganda tropes without actually being propagandist; a heck of a trick. It must be hard to calibrate this.The entire show is just chock full of nuggets and neither preaches nor deigns to condescend to the audience. Pacing is always even and feels right. The writers know where to push and where not to.We will see how long this can be maintained. The writers show a gift for twisting & adding-to old plots into new shows.

Its not pretty and seems out dated. Despite this, its hard to say that this pulls the show down. No, not even one bit. The absolutely clever writing and well designed character personalities are basically what this show floats upon.Unlike many other cartoons that have a sub plot in every episode, the ones in this show are actually relevant and memorable. They aren't just there as fillers and they are nearly as important as the main story. In fact, in most episodes its hard to tell which one is the sub plot and which one is the main plot.What I'm trying to say is that this show is near perfect.

            "review": "Here are the reasons Rick and Morty is one of the worst shows on TV right now.First off, the \"comedy\". If you market your show as a \"comedy\", you should at least have funny jokes. Is an old man belching and abusing his grandson and a teenager stammering really that funny? Maybe it's the juvenile dick and fart jokes that are made every five seconds. Is it because there are pop culture references? Pop culture references don't make something good. Even if you get the references being made, that's still no excuse to give something a pass because it's too lazy to come up with its own jokes so it references something that's already been made and hopes the audience gets the reference. The show's target audience isn't even old enough to get the references, so why do they even bother anyway?This brings me to another point. From what I've heard, a large portion of the show is improvised, to the point where the show's writers work the episodes' scripts around it. Improvisation is not only something that is better in small doses but also really, REALLY hard to get people laughing while doing it. If you're someone like Robin Williams (R.I.P.), then you can do that with no problems (i.e. Aladdin). The problem is that Justin Roiland, who voices both of the titular characters, is not good enough. The fact that the script is worked around his... let's just say lackluster improv only serves to bring down what should be a really funny episode. There are two episodes that are almost entirely improv, and they are among the least funny episodes of the show I've watched.Second, the show has horrendous character design. Each and every (human) character has inhumanly skinny torsos and large heads, I assume because none of them properly neotenized. The alien characters have varying designs, but there is so much variety that it seems like the show's creators wanted to put \"weird\" creatures into the show just for the weirdness value.Third, the show tries to be \"edgy\" by being an existentialist drama, but it just comes off as being preachy and stupid. Now, I'm not saying that existentialist dramas can't be good; in fact, when they're done right, they can really make you think. Rick and Morty doesn't do that. Whenever it's done, I'm always reminded of the end of every modern Family Guy episode where one of the characters gives a big, heartfelt speech acknowledging their mistakes before being welcomed back into the family so that they can repeat the process next week.I usually try not to judge the quality of a series based on its fanbase, but, by GOD, the Rick and Morty fanbase is giving the Steven Universe fanbase a run for its money. The Rick and Morty fanbase only exists to spout out the trite and unfunny quotes that come from the show en masse and on repeat like a broken record. A good portion of them also treat Rick and Morty like it's some god-tier show and act all high and mighty towards anyone that doesn't watch it, and wonder if there's something wrong with you if you don't like it.It's hard not to notice the similarities between this show and Futurama, which also had a sci-fi theme and plenty of nerdy stuff while still managing to be both hilarious and heartwarming. I mean, who DIDN'T cry at the episode about Fry's dog?As I'm writing this, I came up with a theory for why this show is so popular. It's because it's an adult swim show. Now, anyone who's familiar with adult swim knows that many of its shows are stinkers. It's not like Rick and Morty is up against stiff competition when compared to other adult swim programs like Mr. Pickles, Robot Chicken, Squidbillies, and Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell.Now, there are some good things about the show. The animation is clean and consistent (but that doesn't mean that I like the character design, because, as I mentioned earlier, I don't). Chris Parnell does a good job of playing his character from Archer. There was one joke in the episode where dogs take over the world that made me laugh, but, looking back on it, it's not really that funny of a joke. But believe me when I say that the negatives far outweigh the positives.I've watched about ten episodes of this show. Those ten episodes were all I needed in order to stay away from it.

But it's as intelligent and hilarious a show as I haven't seen one since a long time! That's what I and hopeful many other viewers are going to realize after a couple of minutes. It'S one of those shows that wouldn't happen to be without Adult Swim. Not exactly a family show. Anyways - this show is brilliant. The humor is not as cheap as in most of the successful cartoons and the show is not as comfortable to watch, but that's one thing that makes it so hilarious. It's really dark sometimes, and the viewer with a good sense of humor will appreciate that. The only thing that might make the show a bit better is that the creators could make the characters a bit better known and thus more likable to the viewer. Like this a plot as in episode 6 (SE1) would work even better. Well, the characters maybe a bit flat still, but the plots and happenings are making all this acceptable. Amazingly funny and thoughtful story line for a 20min cartoon show. The sad part is, that it might not really be for the rank and file and as a result might not last for too long or even be recognized by too many people. I really hope this goes on for a while, though! I love this show - it's great.

Despite often having a fast-pace you could still follow what was going on, and feel invested. You'd wonder how Rick & Morty would save the day, and be impressed by how things turned out. There's even strong moments of drama and pathos, and a promising mythology build-up with Citadel of Ricks, Evil Morty etc. All 30 eps are worth watching. 9/10.Seasons 4-5 are a pale shadow: it's lost the intelligence, the wit and the depth. It's ditched the mythology, recycles ideas and replaced dramatic pathos with school-level family drama. Rick has gone from being one of the great cartoon characters to becoming a dull self-aware Deus Ex Machina tool (even meta-referencing this during one S5 ep...that's not smart, that just highlights how lazy the writing has become). Flanderization has affected the other characters too, All the show's got left is being weird, and upping the hectic up to 11...it's way too fast-paced, as a viewer it's just painful to follow now. From the 16 eps so far of Seasons 4 & 5 there's two, maybe three eps worth watching...a shockingly poor return, and frankly a waste of my time now. 3/10.Watch the first three seasons and pretend it ended then.",

I don't like 'Yellowstone' and stopped watching it when I realized it was a soap opera and not a drama and all of its characters are unlikeable. In the case of the daughter-despicable. I thought 1883 got off to a brilliant start, but lost its way after the halfway point. I thought Sheridan's screenplay for 'Hell or High Water' was fantastic. His screenplay and direction of 'Wind River' was outstanding. I love 'The Mayor of Kingstown' and I'm really liking 'Tulsa King.' So, it's a mixed bag.1923 starts out like a drama and let's hope it stays that way. Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren are perfectly cast. Isabel May, from 1883, is back for the narration, which will upset some who couldn't stand her accent, but I thought her poetic narration was perfect.So, 1923 is off to a promising start and I look forward to the next episode.",

As to the character of the young girl, Teonna, I believe she will be the ancestor of Chief Rainwater in Yellowstone.As to the young man playing Spencer Dutton, he's in Africa because he was too traumatized by WWI to go home. If you don't know the history, you won't understand.We are only 2 episodes into 1923. Sheridan has said it will take 2 seasons to complete this story. Be patient. There's a long way to go.",

She is supposed to be British from London but speaks standard American and her too peroxide hair and a forever giggling, flirtatious 'vaudeville' acting (even in highly distressful scenes) means you can't take her seriously. She doesn't feel real, and so all those scenes just feel like a much less dramatic genre than the rest of the series where especially the scenes at the Indian nunnery school stand out in intensity. Helen Mirren and Harrison Ford's characters are also impeccable, nuanced and full of gravitas. All in all a great series but with a bit of genre confusion.",

Whoever directed it shows a great lack of taste in showing OTT violence and allowing the cast to overact to cartoonish standards.

Taylor Sheridan has quietly evolved into Hollywood's #1 \"golden boy.\" Sheridan has active been in the industry for less than a decade, and has already demonstrated the ability to write, direct, produce and even act (Sons of Anarchy). He has earned 24 awards out of 57 total nominations. Most importantly, he is the creator behind the massively popular Yellowstone franchise and its knockoffs -- of which 1923 is merely the latest. Knowing that this show was destined to be a hit, the producers doubled down on their reputation for idiosyncratic casting, putting both Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren in the leads. The chemistry not only works, it is brilliant. That said, there are tricks and tropes in 1923 which hint that Sheridan is still experimenting with his scripts (the safari scenes, the exaggerated violence) -- and refuses to fit into any reviewer's preconceived notions or expectations. Good for him. Some viewers will eat that up. And some won't.

Just like Taylor Sheridan has gotten Stallone to act in his first series in 'Tulsa king' which so far is a perfectly paced crime drama that isn't too heavy and still keeps the cowboy feeling to it.. there's never been a crime Mafia series set in cattle/cowboy country like it and it has Stallone like Ford, putting his all for his age, into the performance. Even tho many shots are obviously not Stallone with the character he's talking to, but using doubles. 5his has become significantly more obvious since the pandemic... actors wanting less interaction with lots of people makes it easier when his driver is talking to him and you can only see a half back of the head of Stallone. This happens in many conversational part of the series with him. But he chews the scenery everytime he's alone and has admitted in interviews doing a tv series is the most demanding and tiring he's ever felt working. Which from the guy that played Rambo.... that says alot about what Mr Sheridan expects from his lead cast. I highly doubt he'd hire Harrison Ford if he was going to play bored old man like he has for 3 decades of film. I feel like he's going to leave this series as his acting legacy. And with James Marigold directing the new Indiana Jones, the same guy that made Logan and got the best performance from the two older leading cast members. I mean since then, is sad so see Patrick Stewart in the newtrek destroyed by A.kurztman...nwith his acting being horrible compared to Logan.Explains how just after one episode I trust it will be a 8-9 out of 10 series. Just the amazing effort by one of the top 3 female actors in the world alive. Helen miren. And then seeing Harrison Ford not only acting for once, but so far doing it really well, Compared to the lead Dutton in 1889 he's killing it with his performance. And this is only after a single episode... but they both play the same character and that's a very hardened man, from loss and hardship.The incredible achievement by Mr Sheridan with yellow stone, then 1889... followed by Tulsa king and 1923 with such a incredible cast. Even if you somehow found this first episode too slow placed, I'd say give it 4 episodes before you make your mind up. I put off watching yellow stone until it's 3rd season... after trying to get into it... but one day I had nothing to do and gave it another shot....\nI'm so glad i did. The saga Taylor has created, will live on as the greatest modern westerns. Since around tombstone eara, westerns then had a big decline. Eastwood stopped acting in them with his last one in the 90s that I can't recall the name of... perhaps redemption ?TL;DR\nThis is another feather in the cap for the greatest show runner currently alive, with hands on witting and directing 3 currently running series. With one in its 5th season... never in the history of TV or film have extremely high production prequels with star cast members ever been put out so fast? 3 more series within 6 years.Mr Sheridan, I hope I'm spelling that properly\nYou've done something incredible with your 4 series within 5 years.. from SOA Sheriff to being up there in the top 5 best tv show runners of all time.

While it clearly aims to capture the dark, family-centric crime drama vibes of \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Ozark,\" viewers might find themselves adrift in a narrative that prioritizes rapid-fire character introductions and convoluted plot twists over coherent storytelling. This isn't a measured, character-driven descent into the criminal underworld; it's a messy, often frantic, dive.The series immediately establishes the Buckley family's desperation as their once-proud fishing empire teeters on the brink of collapse. Patriarch Harlan (Holt McCallany) and his determined wife Belle (Maria Bello) find themselves pulled back into a world of drug smuggling, largely due to their son Cane's (Jake Weary) initial botched foray into it. However, the show's unique-and arguably frustrating-ability to have characters \"pop up left, right, and center\" without adequate prior explanation creates a disorienting experience. Past events are frequently alluded to but rarely clarified, leaving viewers constantly asking \"who is who, why, when, and where\" well into the second episode. This can make it incredibly difficult to connect with any specific character's motivations or truly grasp the stakes of the immediate situation.Unlike the meticulously crafted character arcs and tight plotting of \"Breaking Bad\" or the strategic brilliance of \"Ozark,\" \"The Waterfront\" feels less sophisticated. The characters, while certainly flawed and driven by desperation, often lack the nuanced depth that would make their actions truly resonate. Their decisions frequently feel impulsive and less like the calculated moves of individuals navigating a treacherous criminal landscape, leading to a sense of dramatic convenience rather than organic development.Yet, \"The Waterfront\" is not without its chaotic charm. It embraces its \"Southern-fried gothic\" identity with gusto, offering a steady diet of betrayals, shocking violence, and high-octane melodrama. Think less \"prestige TV\" and more \"nighttime soap opera with a body count.\" The production values are slick, showcasing the picturesque yet equally foreboding North Carolina coastline. Topher Grace, in particular, stands out as Grady, a tech-bro interloper who brings an almost jarring, yet undeniably entertaining, energy to the proceedings.Ultimately, \"The Waterfront\" is a show that prioritizes relentless action and constant surprises over a clear, easily digestible narrative. If you're looking for a meticulously plotted crime drama that rewards careful attention to detail, you might find yourself frustrated. However, if you're in the mood for a fast-paced, often outrageous, and undeniably bingeable ride through a family's desperate struggle to survive in a morally ambiguous world, even if it means sacrificing some narrative clarity, \"The Waterfront\" just might keep you hooked - despite its rough edges. It's a wild, often messy, but undeniably entertaining trip to the dark side of the Outer Banks.",

The main issue lies with the characters. There are simply too many of them, and none are properly developed. It feels like the creators tried to cram in the entire cast from the start, but failed to give anyone a meaningful arc or believable motivation. The characters are flat, the dialogue is hollow, and at times it feels like watching the millionth episode of Santa Barbara - without any of the charm. Melissa Benoist and Gerardo Celasco deserve some credit; their performances are the only watchable aspect. They do their best to carry the drama, but the script works against them. Everything else is slow, dull, and poorly staged. The pacing drags, the conflicts fall flat, and the storytelling lacks momentum. The one redeeming quality is the visual presentation. The cinematography and locations are genuinely impressive - but nice shots alone can't save a lifeless show. Bottom line: a sluggish, uninspired series with no real character. The script is virtually nonexistent. Not recommended.",

She has come a long way from Coyote Ugly but I have enjoyed her in the last few projects i have seen her in. The story has a few good twists and I do hope it has a second season.

He does well portraying Harlan Buckley. Danielle Campbell is a goddess. Jake Weary does very well as Cane Buckley but I don't believe he's as wimpy in real life as Cane. Cane is very pathetic, he's very cowardly and disrespectful. He endangers his marriage with his obvious infatuation with his ex. He's blessed with an incredibly beautiful wife and daughter and he takes it for granted. Jake must grit his teeth on occasion having to portray such a demeaning character. The beautiful and talented Melissa Benoist also has a challenging task in portraying Bree Buckley, an addict who suffers very painful disrespect from her son, that would be so difficult. Danielle Campbell, I would probably watch the show just to see her portraying the daughter Peyton Buckley, damn she's beautiful. In my opinion this is a decent series, about as good as anything streaming right now. I discontinued watching one with higher reviews because I found it dull after a while. Everyone has different tastes, in everything and entertainment is no exception. Some people almost seem to watch shows to criticize them so it's hard to tell from reviews alone if something will be entertaining to you. Many seem to criticize everything, nothing meets their expectations. Other's seemingly just enjoy posting reviews to impress upon others how elegant and urbane they are.

There's plenty of family conflict, suspense and crime shenanigans to hill the whole season and an episode is usually over before you know it.

Netflix sometimes scoops up Big 3 rejects and gets a little mileage out of their purchases. If this one was bought on the basis of the pilot, with the rest of the series still in production pause, then maybe this one will break out of the TVPG frame that the pilot wears like a pair of handcuffs. If the production was further along, this will be a waste of time to watch.Production values are pretty much on the level of the typical CBS multi-season trash series. I'm going to give this a few more episodes to see whether it's watchable for 8 episodes, since the cast isn't bad. Several of the cast members are already established second tier film actors or what passes for star quality with network Big 3 junk TV series productions. Cable network series are much better than the Big 3 crap, so it's doubtful that this series was aimed at anyone other than the dinosaurs.Jake Weary looks less like a young bum here. In Animal Kingdom, his ridiculous hair and laughable tats eclipsed his acting ability. He could have been a contender if his AK character wasn't so unlikable. He had a lesser role in the film, A Message for the King, but he showed his talent in a better light. I hope this role is good for him.

Not gonna lie, it didn't blow my mind, but it tied things up nicely without feeling rushed or annoying. You get some closure on the main plot, and a few loose ends left to keep you thinking. I like that balance.The vibe reminds me a bit of Boardwalk Empire or Peaky Blinders - moody, gritty, with a lot of tension and some slick cinematography. Definitely not a happy-go-lucky show, so if you want light stuff, skip it. But if you're into slow-burning crime drama with some cool character moments, it's your jam. Actors did their thing, no huge Hollywood names, but everyone felt natural and believable. The lead was especially good at playing that tough but kinda broken dude. No overacting or cheesy lines, which I appreciated.Would I recommend it? Yeah, if you like crime dramas and want something chill to watch.

Based on the real-life work of forensic anthropologist and novelist Kathy Reichs, it's fun, kicky, and only occasionally too gruesome to look at. Not quite like one of Ms. Reichs' novels, it is still a pleasure for a fan (me!) to watch. Boreanaz' past work on Buffy and Angel stands in good stead here as he delivers lines that stand up to a strong female role without diminishing it. Also like Buffy, humor lends grace to embarrassing social situations that highlight common human vulnerabilities. Surrounding the 2 major players are other characters who add to the thrust of a character driven show. The writers do good work giving each character unique attributes that have nothing to do with hair color or body measurements. The entire cast does a good job presenting real, quirky individuals who don't have to rely on looks to sell the worth of their character to the viewers. That alone is something new for any CSI show.

She is serious, candid and forthright. Her ability to \"handle\" herself stems from confidence and experience, not tragedy or pathology as is so often the case in TV-land female characters.Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) could be a hardened, tough guy, stereotypical character. He is not. While we are reminded regularly of his past as a military sniper, the sensitivity he brings to his duties as an FBI agent redeem his past actions, as is his hope. Make no mistake, he is a fierce patriot and proud FBI man, yet his character's motives and motivation are clear and noble. They are never fanatically righteous or overbearingly macho.These two characters are wonderfully balanced with each other: their approach to life, to their work, to the pursuit of this week's mystery. Their relationship rings true. Through agreements, disagreements and the sense of humor it takes to weather both, Deschanel and Boreanaz always deliver the wry portrayal these two staunchly serious, but genuinely human characters deserve. Each character's work is expertly accomplished and equally important to the solutions they unravel together. As audience, we enjoy their working together. Temperance Brennan and Seeley Booth are a great team - as are Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz.With these two very real 21st Century individuals, and stories that skillfully incorporate forensic anthropology, both as it is used in the discipline of anthropology to understand the most ancient of artifacts, and as it is used in the most modern criminal labs, the foundation is strong for TV entertainment of the highest kind. But, it isn't only the charisma of the two main characters or their portrayers that keeps the show real, believable, compelling. Dr. Brennan's support team at the lab are a fine crew (Michaela Conlin as Angela Montenegro - forensic artist and friend to Dr. Brennan, Eric Millegan as Zack Addy - genius, geeky, naively lovable forensic anthropologist in-training, T.J. Thyne as Dr. Jack Hodgins - soil, bug and all-things-creepy expert, and Jonathan Adams as Dr. Daniel Goodman - administrator/anthropologist and the lab crew's boss). Each has an expertise that is technically viable and each is well portrayed by the actors cast. It all adds up to a TV show you can't wait to see again next week!",

Also, an autopsy shows that the corpse's neck has been wrung, like a chicken's. Bones and Booth trace the corpse to a chicken farm, which is being picketed by hipster protesters chanting, \"Cluck you, cluck you.\" Here they learn that the victim developed his chicken-like face when the farm's chicken stench caused his nasal passages to become deformed. Then, they probably solve the case. I don't know. I couldn't finish watching. I've never made it more than halfway through an episode. Not for lack of trying.I don't remember exactly, but the chicken episode may be the same one in which the corpse is found by a troop of girl scouts who carefully preserve it and transport it to the FBI lab on their scout bus, with the consent of their scout leader. And let me tell you, the realism left me feeling refreshed.The above plot description might make it sound like this is an inspired, surreal parody of cop shows, but it isn't. If this was parody, I'd expect the actors to play it completely deadpan. Instead, they're trying to be so cute and precious that we just want to eat them up.There's Bones -- whose level of social awkwardness is wildly inconsistent, depending on which writer is phoning in the gags -- and Booth, her thoroughly bland boss, and a group of thirteen year old boys disguised as lab technicians. One of these guys is named \"Sweets,\" which alone is enough to push this show from annoying to intolerable.There's also a slutty girl (Angela, I think her name is?) who has no identifiable function other than letting us know every six minutes that she's been sleeping around. How this advances the plot in any way is beyond me. Maybe it all comes together in the second half of the episodes, when I'm not watching.The only unique aspect of \"Bones\" is the shockingly grotesque corpses. Now, if the rest of the show was as grotesque -- if these corpses were put into any sort of appropriate context, that is -- it would be one of the darkest, most compelling shows on television. Instead, we are treated to the bizarre spectacle of these hideous, decaying bodies that look like they're from the set of a Lucio Fulci movie displayed in brightly-lit rooms while childish actors poke at them and flirt with each other against sparkly background music. It's one of the weirdest things I've ever seen, but it's not funny or interesting at all. It's unwatchable.0/10.",

For fans of Ms Reichs books, this is a slightly odd amalgam of Kathy herself and her main character Temperance Brennan, who on the show is also a crime author (like Ms Reichs - a top forensic anthropologist and author.)The characters are all new, apart from Brennan's ex-husband Pete (although we only got a glimpse of him in the season premiere) plus it is set in Washington DC rather than Canada and Virginia as in the books.Tempe herself is rather different than the book character. Emily Deschanel is fine, but rather young and headstrong compared to the book Tempe. Even in the one episode, we have seen her rushing into things quite recklessly. I guess they wanted to make her a little more dynamic for TV.The chemistry between Brennan and Booth (Boreanaz) was pretty good from the start, although they need to handle it properly. Maybe the Mulder and Scully reference is a hint of how they might handle things. However, the crime was a little flimsy. This first episode seemed to focus far more on establishing character and tone than on plot. Probably something that will change with future episodes.On the whole, Riechs fans can have fun being snooty and complaining about Tempe's drinking and the lack of her cat, but I thought the show had definite possibilities.

And what's worse, after 10mins of irritating you with her social inept and refuse to understand other way of thinking, you are being slapped with at least 10mins of her failing to do the normal social thing, + another 10 of apologies for failing to do so, + 10mins of cheesy you get it next time.

Every episode, she mocks at human being, then she glare or hate you because you laugh at her failure to act accordingly, and she feels no pity for you when she nuke you down with her harsh words.

And lot of times, her character changes her personality like 180 degree so quick, that you feel not genuine. Like she dish on your behavior to the ground with her whiny monotone for a good 3mins+, then within 30s, she came and join you and act like it was really fun -.- The plot line is boring, and a few episodes are rip off of other show, without the good bit of it. All the side characters are annoying. They are whiny, not funny in any sense, doesn't have a real personality. Overall, the show is too contrive, the case is way way too boring, and some give you a déjà vu sense, and make you miss how good other show is. I put it on as background noise to see if I will hate it less than when I was watching it seriously, but I just end up found it too hard to stand to even watch it to fall asleep, I got fury up watching this show to be able to sleep. This show is not even worth it as background noise, I rather watch bad infomercial than this crap show, and no, I haven't read the book!i just genuine hate everything about this show!",

So how does this stand out from all those other forensic show?

            "review": "I am a regular reader of Kathy Reichs' Temperance Brennan novels. As such I am extremely surprised she even consulted on this show.It is HORRIBLE by comparison to the books. The Temperance Brennan character is, in the books, a down to earth recovering alcoholic and divorced mom of a college aged daughter. In 'Bones', she is an arrogant (rhymes with rich), who, in typical P C fashion, is not a mother. The emphasis on her assisting staff, complete with lurid details of who has had how many sexual exploits, is totally in contrast with the books.In total deference to the P C movement, she portrays the enemies of the U S as peace lovers (!). Some of the information isn't even correct, for example, having a character from Afghanistan as an active member of an Arab-American friendship group. Since when is an Afghan an Arab?! I'm sure if negative references were made to 'disadvantaged minorities', or women, or GLBT's, the show's producers/writers/directors would have to issue an apology. However, in typical far left fashion, all of the racial slurs go to the highest achieving minority group--Asians, as David Boreanaz' Agent Booth continually refers to Angela Montenegro as a 'squint'.Forget that stuff, and forget this show. After 'The Man in the SUV' episode, I thought I'd try a second episode to see if it got any better. It only got worse! I don't even care if the teenager in question was murdered or committed suicide, and I won't be watching the show ever again.",

However, as time went on I found the show to become increasingly more gimmicky and unrelatable. Each new episode involved the team to investigate a murder that occurred in some new niche that was far too extreme, in my opinion. The people didn't feel like real people, they were all defined by a single trait (artisan businesses, mole people, Amish life).It all felt fake. Especially the \"lovable\" characters of our investigative team, or \"squints.\" Characters were given specific traits at what was convenient for the writers. Bones will be ultra- competitive, but it will be only noticeable in this episode. Or the death has something to do with something fairly obscure? Don't worry, this character has some background knowledge on this for no reason whatsoever. There just is no consistency in the characters. What made the whole thing worse was the inclusion of the interns in season 3 or 4(?) which only served to be a gimmick. It gives you the depressed one, the cocky one, the country one, the super smart one; extremes that just don't exist in the real world. And each one will have a dark back story for the purpose of drama that will just distance the characters farther and farther from the real world.After realizing how incredibly ridiculous each character was, I chose to stick it through and just watch this show for what it is; a crime show. Watch the squints as they solve crimes through complex and interesting cases. But then there was an obvious pattern. Unlike most crime shows which shows how a series of events lead to capturing the killer, Bones provides a much simpler solution. Booth and Brennan will investigate and investigate until they find a small detail in the bones (a nick or grooving) that they somehow hadn't noticed until the last ten minutes of the show that miraculously solves the case for them. The first fifty feel pointless because of this.Suffice it to say, I did not find this show enjoyable and can barely get through an episode anymore without finding it completely ridiculous. Every few seconds I feel myself groaning or laughing at how impossible it is.",

You know, like real life.I thoroughly recommend that you watch this.",

            "review": "It's a really good series (season two, I'm talking about), full of very moving scenes, but the writers go overboard on the liberal bandwagonPersonally, I don't like the idea of a male couple adopting a child because I think it's a totally self indulgent act that doesn't take into account the trauma that the child is going to go through. Especially growing up in the cruel world of the schoolyard.Maybe my old fashioned values are too biased towards a kid's mental well being?But the writers conveniently ignore this aspect , it's always well- to- do gay parents with BMWs who are portrayed as saintly caregivers, and no attention is ever paid to the child's picture of the world.They do deal very well with the sexual abuse aspect of the plotline and the psychological damage that lasts a lifetime , there's no lack of reality in this theme.I must say that the acting is fabulous , not one character miscast in the entire series and the scriptwriting is as tight as you can get, so the production package can't be faulted.I just don't see why we have to have all of these \"minority society\" messages shoved down our throats when it's supposed to be entertainment for the masses",

Seeing the first episode of \"Unforgotten\" (Series 1) was enough to whet my appetite for more so I was thrilled to see what they would do with another season and another plot line that slowly and methodically (but not pedantically) plays out across all six episodes. What comes across in both series is that your past can pop up at the most inopportune moments. Play it for dramatic effect and you will understand why \"Unforgotten\" is such a powerful and mesmerizing crime drama series. Above all, it's the humanity of the characters that draws you in and keeps you interested in what will happen to them when the past rears its ugly head--sometimes with disastrous consequences!",

In some of her roles, she look like your aunt, while sometimes being very pretty (I mean that in a good way). In this entry, she leads a homicide team checking out, in the first two seasons, 2 separate cold cases. We get to know Nicola's character, and most others quite well (a Hallmark of Brit cinema).As well as good conflict & character development, the show benefits from crisp pacing (6 episodes of 45 mins instead of 8x65). If you are a binge watcher (thank you Netflix and BritBox), you can sample a season in 2 days without booking off work! We found Season 2's storyline superior to the first one. There is a whodunit element to the series, but, as I wrap up Season 2, I can honestly say the writers have played it close to the vest. Enjoy!Footnote: Both seasons involve cases involving 'deviant' sexual behaviour, which is not shown, but discussed, as related to the crimes being investigated. Hence, proceed at own risk.",

In your narrow world Lefties and refugees are wonderful and noble; but the so called right wingers are bad and evil. You do realise that at least >50% of the population has different political opinions to you yes? We don't need your biased, virtue signalling and sneering of anyone that doesn't fit into your political ideology. A more balanced presentation would not alienate half your audience. This is not entertaining in the slightest, it's painful to sit through. No escapism here whatsoever. British TV has just swung so far left that it's boring and tiresome. Avoid at all costs or just go to Twitter/X and argue with lefties.",

If I wanted to watch a leftist political advert, I would do so.Even worse, even more unforgiveable, is never ending excuse making for bad behavior, and the \"elevation\" of what is best described as those who see themselves as victims.

            "review": "Thunderbolts* is unlike anything we've seen before in a superhero blockbuster. Its bold focus on mental health is the beating heart of the film, shaping the story in a way that's refreshingly original. We've had plenty of superhero (and anti-hero) movies, but none have tackled mental health as deeply or as honestly as this. This is as fresh as it gets, and the film hits its message squarely on the mark. Could that message have been louder or more powerful? Absolutely. But is it enough for audiences to understand, feel, and reflect on? Without a doubt. It's a gem that invites viewers to empathize, to look inward, and to recognize the struggles of those around them. In many ways, Thunderbolts feels like a superhero in its own right, delivering a powerful PSA that's woven seamlessly into the narrative rather than feeling tacked on.We're in love with the concept here; an anti-hero film built around mental health. It makes the story and the character arcs far deeper and more meaningful than they'd be if these were just your typical caped crusaders. Thunderbolts* is the MCU's rawest exploration of mental health to date. We've heard the words \"trauma\" and \"healing\" tossed around in superhero flicks before like WandaVision, but this is different. This film doesn't just mention the weight of mental health, it lives in it. Yelena's story, in particular, has been carefully nurtured since Phase 4, and the decision to continue her journey down this road is nothing short of brilliant. Yelena, like Black Widow before her, isn't a superhero with powers. She's human. She's flawed, resilient, and painfully relatable and that makes her journey hit even harder.We actually like the character dynamics between the anti-heroes. We like that every of their personality shines. Their dynamics push the film's mental health themes even further. These might have been the underdogs of previous movies, characters we barely remembered but here, they get their moment. And wow, do they deliver. Each one gets time to prove they're so much more than sidekicks or forgotten faces and by the end, you can't help but root for them.What's especially moving is how much these characters matter both to themselves and to each other. They've all been torn down, denigrated, beaten back, and made to feel like the world is against them. They're loners by nature, forced into the uncomfortable space of working as a team for the first time. Watching them navigate that, to lean on each other when things fall apart, is both heartwarming and powerful. It's a clear reminder of the importance of friendship, of admitting when you need help, and of realizing that none of us can do it all alone.The action sequences in this are great. It's a blast watching everyone throw down and show off their skills. But here's the thing, while the action is awesome, it's not what makes this film great. This movie proves that a superhero film doesn't need to lean on endless explosions to leave an impact. The story itself is raw, human, and beautifully told and that is more than enough. That's why Thunderbolts* stands tall in the post-Endgame era. The action is tight, but the storytelling is what really puts it over the top.And guess what? They didn't rely on cameos. We could safely say that Deadpool vs Wolverine, Spider-Man: No Way Home and Thunderbolts* are the top 3 films after Avengers Endgame but what Thunderbolts* sets apart from the other two is it's the only one that doesn't rely on cameos. It doesn't need nostalgic bait, it doesn't need 'help' from anyone, it's just them trying to save the day and trying to figure out how to solve the problems they are in. And we love them for it.Florence Pugh, as always, is a knockout. She's never missed a beat, and once again, she's phenomenal here. Her accent might not be perfect, but who cares? She's a powerhouse, carrying the weight of a character struggling with identity and searching for meaning. She's the voice of so many who feel lost or stuck, and Pugh brings that to life with so much heart. She's a beacon of hope, a reminder that even when it feels impossible, there's light at the end of the tunnel. The rest of the cast? Stellar too. Lewis Pullman deserves a special shoutout. He proves here that he's a force to be reckoned with. Forget the early skepticism about his casting. He owns it completely, and Hollywood seriously needs to give this guy more credit.And yes, Malaysia plays a huge role in this film and the Menara Merdeka 118 shot is breathtaking. Instead of the usual sunny, warm tones we often see, the film opts for a moodier palette blue, dark, and cloudy which beautifully matches the film's somber, reflective theme. It just fits.The third act really dives deep into the mental health themes, in a way that feels raw and personal. The true villain here isn't a monster or alien, it's the demons we all battle inside. It emphasizes this theme in a way that feels plausible, personable and relatable. A villain that lives within all of us. A villain that everyone of us has battled against in some way and some parts in our lives. How much you connect with the film might depend on how you view your life and how much experience you've dealt with but one thing's for sure, it'll leave you thinking long after the credits roll.Was anything wasted in this film? There is one. One character didn't get nearly the spotlight they deserved. Everyone else got their moment to shine except for one and that felt like a missed opportunity.As for the comedy, it's hit and miss. Some of it lands really well. The belly-laugh kind of good while other moments fall flat or feel a bit forced. Some jokes could've used a little more setup, and a few felt repetitive, but overall, there's enough good humor sprinkled in.We did feel like the third act could have fleshed out more. It could have used more breathing room. It moves fast, too fast at times and some moments feel rushed or a bit disjointed. If they'd let things simmer just a bit longer, it could have been even more impactful.And yes, Thunderbolts* has 2 credits scene. The first one is simply light and funny which is bearable enough but the second one will hype everyone up for what's to come. Not that it's important to reveal it at the end credits but with audience losing hope for the future of MCU, this will get everyone back on their feet, cheering and hoping that Phase 6 will be the same with what Phase 3 had to offer...or at least almost.Verdict: Thunderbolts* is the anti-hero film we didn't know we needed. It delivers a story rooted in something we all face: mental health. This is raw. It's personal. And it feels relatable and real. It explores themes of isolation, trauma, and the power of asking for help, making it one of the MCU's most personal stories yet. It ditches the nostalgia bait and focuses on characters wrestling with their own demons, making their journeys relatable and impactful. The action is tight, but it's the emotional weight that truly lands (Yes, we did cry a bit). Florence Pugh leads with power and vulnerability, backed by a stellar cast and the famous Malaysia's Menara Merdeka 118 isn't just cinematic, it symbolizes the towering weight these characters carry. Thank you, Marvel.",

            "review": "\"Thunderbolts\" it's some of Marvel's darkest material to date, dealing with the emotional wreckage of broken individuals grappling with their past choices and finding camaraderie amidst the emptiness of their lives. This may be a team-up movie, but it very much belongs to Florence Pugh, who carries much of the dramatic weight of the movie on her back, while Lewis Pullman delivers a complex performance as a sympathetic character at war with himself. The imperfections somehow all feel fitting for this anti-hero team of misfits. Putting emphasis on the character work and practical action makes this feel like the old Marvel that has us for a decade plus. Wish we'd gotten this sooner.\"Thunderbolts*\" it's a bold dive into trauma, healing, and redemption. Proof that even the so-called defective losers and disposable delinquents can rise above their past and become the heroes no one expected. It's gritty, emotional and unlike anything Marvel has done before - a must-see story that hits where it hurts and heals where it matters.I can tell that the movie is one of Marvel's most enjoyable films in a while. It feels different than most of the studio's projects. Its bold, funny, filled with great action and an unexpected emotional punch. It has the rewatchable factor for sure. Has so much spark, charisma, and tells a genuinely emotional story you connect with.It is truly fantastic, the cast has electric chemistry with each other (Florence Pugh & Lewis Pullman are the standouts) and the action sequences are very strong. But most of all, the movie's story is bold, important & so well-written. Florence Pugh brings the heart, David Harbour is consistently funny, & Lewis Pullman might be the stealth MVP.This is probably one of he most if not the most humane movie filled with allowing their anti hero being flawed, broken and regretful. Sebastian Stan has an absolute scene stealing moment, yet Florence Pugh shows she is the true lead of the new generation and team. She is the star, that shines the brightest. There's a lot to love in this movie honestly.A visually daring, emotionally resonant superhero movie that pushes mental health to the forefront. The MCU future is bright. Definitely stick around after the credits, there are 2 scenes and the last one will make you so hyped!",

            "review": "I went into this movie with no expectations. It wasn't until the A24 trailer released that I felt excited enough to commit to seeing this at the cinema (unlike Brave New World which I will be watching on Disney+ when it releases). Sebastian Stan and Florence Pugh are fantastic actors, and The Winter Soldier is one of my favourite characters in the franchise. So, I figured why not give this movie a chance, despite the sting of unenjoyable messes that Disney has released to the world since Endgame.It's difficult to explain the problems with this film without spoilers, and so I'm simply going to reflect my main frustrations.Firstly, nothing in this movie makes any sense. None of the characters behave in ways that are consistent with their characters or even build any sense of character. Any character could be saying what's being said or be doing what's been done. All that changes is the skin. These characters are pulled through a pre-written storyline that offers them no growth or development. They move to the next place where the story needs them to be. And we, the audience, and simply meant to accept that.Secondly, this movie acts darker than it actually is. Attempts to tackle challenging and complex issues are wrapped in Disney's usual comedy wrapper, and the events of the movie essentially eradicate any real feeling of depth. Remember when Quantumania ended and you were left expecting something \"more\" to happen to match the threat that had been presented? That!Thirdly, this movie relies far too heavily on the talent of the cast to sell it. Time and time again, this movie sets up what could have been genuinely memorable moments...only to rip them away.Overall, this movie is a very low risk-low reward installment. If you enjoyed Quantumania, Iron Man 2, Black Widow, and Thor 4, you might rate this movie quite highly. If you were expecting something new, dark, and risky, you'll be disappointed.",

I walked into the cinema with low expectations and came out a fan all over again-and the fact that it pulled that off without an A-list cast is impressive in itself.And the best compliment I could give the movie: it didn't feel like a 2hr sit, more like 90 minutes.The character development and storytelling are top-notch. While the plot isn't exactly full of twists, like many comics, it's less about surprises and more about enjoying the ride-and it absolutely delivers on that front.If you enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok, this one's right up your alley: silly humor, stunning effects, and solid performances. I'm genuinely excited to see where this leads next.",

This movie rectified that. Depression, suicidal ideation, apathy, loneliness and all of it was kept there without trying to make you turn away or think it funny.They make you sit with the agony on yelenas face seeing how much her past affects her as well as everyone else. This gave me the emotional sincerity that's always been missing in the majority of mcu projects. The most human marvel has felt in a long time. Solid 8/10.",

And that is, by the way, the best thing I can say about this movie: it didn't offend me. It just simply sucked.The only reason it gets a 3 is because the first half was passable and entertaining. But the build-up to the climax was beyond cliched. It was downright stupid.Turn your brain off completely, and I do mean COMPLETELY, and maybe you can enjoy it.

            "review": "So this is what maturity looks like in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. After years of leaning on forced quips and sitcom-style dialogue, Thunderbolts arrives promising something different. Something deeper. Something grittier. But beneath the darker color grade and the serious expressions, it's still the same Marvel formula. New paint, same blueprint.It's ironic, maybe even overdue, that Marvel finally tried copying DC after more than a decade of DC trying to be Marvel. But instead of carving out a new direction, Thunderbolts plays like a sterilized version of Suicide Squad. The rough edges are gone. What remains is a movie that wants to feel bold but is constrained by its PG-13 rating and its real mission, which is selling action figures to teenagers.The marketing pushes the idea of character development. That's generous. Most of these characters already had entire shows dedicated to their arcs. If they didn't connect with audiences in six to ten hours of streaming content, they're not going to do it in two. What we get instead are a few familiar poses, another sarcastic exchange, and some recycled trauma. It's not development. It's repackaging.The story structure is painfully familiar. A shady government mission. A team of broken toys. A world-ending threat. Cue the third-act group therapy session and a last-minute save. This is Marvel's 36th film, and it plays like it was assembled by an algorithm trained on Marvel's greatest hits. That might not be a cinematic crime, but it's getting harder to care.Sure, there are a few laughs. Some of the lines land. The cast has chemistry. There are brief moments of tension before everything melts into overprocessed CGI. But when you strip away the fan service and the built-in affection for these characters, the skeleton underneath is generic and forgettable. This story could have been outlined on a napkin in fifteen minutes.The film clumsily stitches together characters from earlier titles and calls it synergy. You get three super soldiers, a sidelined Black Widow, and a handful of underdeveloped powers that never quite make visual sense. To raise the stakes, the writers throw in a god-level threat and hope no one asks why. If one Winter Soldier was enough to carry a film, then three of them plus a demigod must be worth your time, right?But the real issue isn't just recycled plots or overused archetypes. Hollywood has always done that. The problem is scale. This movie cost nearly 200 million dollars. That budget could have supported twenty other films with original ideas, new voices, and something real to say. Instead, we get a lifeless monument to franchise maintenance.There was a moment when Marvel seemed to grasp that the audience wanted more. You could see it in Daredevil, in the early promise of Moon Knight, and in the strange ambition of WandaVision. But then came She-Hulk, Thor: Love and Thunder, and a wave of content that treated depth like a liability.Thunderbolts wants to be the pivot point. It wants to announce that Marvel is ready to evolve. But it still follows the same playbook. It markets itself as bold while playing it safe. It pretends to break the mold while filling in the same tired blanks. Maybe that's enough for those happy with recycled thrills and darker lighting. But if you're hoping for something new, all you'll find here is the same old noise in a lower key.",

The chemistry is chaotic in the best way. Messy, funny, a little dark, and somehow still hopeful. It doesn't try to be too big, it just leans into the characters, and that's what makes it hit.Every time Bucky showed up, I swear I sat up straighter. There's just something about him. He doesn't have to say much, but you feel everything. He's still carrying so much weight, trying to find his place in a world that keeps changing, and honestly, same. I could watch a whole movie of just him silently judging everyone while being the reluctant dad of the group.And Florence stole every damn scene. Yelena is chaotic, dry, hilarious, weirdly heartfelt, and painfully relatable. I'd follow her into any fight, even if she's roasting me the whole way. If this is the future of Marvel, more heart, more grit, more flawed outcasts then I'm absolutely here for it.",

            "review": "There are bad movies, and then there are movies so painfully dull that they feel like a form of passive torture. The kind of film where the plot moves at the speed of drying paint, where characters talk endlessly about nothing, and where any promise of action or excitement is crushed under the weight of meaningless dialogue. This is that movie-a sluggish, monotonous experience that tests the audience's patience at every turn.From the very first scene, it's clear that nothing of importance is going to happen anytime soon. The camera lingers on empty hallways, slow pans across unremarkable landscapes, and close-ups of characters sighing dramatically before speaking in long, rambling monologues. The dialogue isn't sharp or insightful-it's just *words*, endless streams of them, filling the runtime without adding depth to the story or the characters. Conversations drag on for minutes, circling the same points without resolution, as if the screenwriter was paid by the word and refused to stop typing.The characters are just as lifeless as the pacing. They stand around in dimly lit rooms, delivering lines with all the energy of someone reading a grocery list. There's no urgency in their voices, no real conflict in their interactions-just a never-ending cycle of half-baked philosophical musings and trivial observations. Even when the plot *should* pick up-when there's finally a hint of danger or a moment that could lead to action-the movie slams on the brakes, cutting away to another tedious conversation or a prolonged silence that adds nothing but runtime.And then, just when you think something might *finally* happen-when a character picks up a weapon, when a mysterious figure appears in the distance-the movie cuts to another scene of people sitting at a table, talking. And talking. And *still talking*. There's no payoff, no release of tension, just more words piling up like a traffic jam of unnecessary exposition. Even the climax-if it can be called that-is a letdown, resolving in yet another conversation instead of the action the entire film has been teasing.By the time the credits roll, the only emotion left is relief-relief that it's over, that no more time will be wasted watching characters do nothing and say everything without ever getting to the point. It's the kind of movie that makes you question why you didn't just turn it off halfway through, except that even walking away feels like it would require more energy than the film itself ever expended.In the end, this isn't just a bad movie-it's an endurance test. A masterclass in how to drain all excitement, energy, and engagement from a story, leaving behind nothing but a hollow, tedious experience. It's the cinematic equivalent of watching grass grow, except grass doesn't talk. And in this case, silence would have been a mercy.",

The whole film was well paced and its overall message was the highlight of the whole thing. The cast was topnotch, especially Florence Pugh (because when isn't she).

It has something endearing about it and is fairly memorable, I think.First, I love this whole erratic chemistry, but strong chemistry nonetheless ; and the way they assembled this team of misfits is obviously not without reminding us of these oh so tasty ensemble action movies from the 90s !!...And yeah, we have already witnessed these various characters in different situations (at the exception of a particular one), so we know what they are capable of and how things could eventually go south in and off the field quite likely, but at the same time we also have never seen them put in such a chaotic situation as a newly formed (and seemingly dysfunctional) team...But this movie's biggest strength lies in its emotional core and the way each of the different protagonists face the events that happen on their path...So it truly feels good to experience each of all this -not so- little moments and how the characters distinctively react and grow from there ; it's really nice to see how they all evolve, step by step, whether it is as a team or on their individual journeys... Yes, you feel the growth in strength of the team as a whole, how they understand each other, but moreover they instinctively end up figuring out the part they have to play for the sake of all... And this comes from each of their inner struggles and subsequently from the self discoveries that arise from that ; which is a process that is truly enjoyable to see all along the movie... Especially because Marvel Studios know how to craft these entertaining human interactions, through hilarious banters and zany situations indeed (which of course make the various connections tangible and tasty), but also by progressively carving relatable characters with life trajectories that give them a greater depth once mysteries unveil and stakes progressively rise...To be noted that the political themes (control, manipulation, corruption) as well as the introduction of a particularly iconic new character, both are a slow burn that offer a great richness to the story, once its dynamics take a new turn and the threat that was hanging over it from the shadow becomes concrete ; with some very crisp and effectively impactful scenes and moments (whether it Is through the juicy dialogues or the cool action scenes, which all have a precise purpose as well as a language that viscerally demonstrates the extent of the impact of this series of choices and events)...That was for sure a very enjoyable ride all the way, and what must be emphasized is how the whole movie is filled with a fair amount of deeply humane emotions (the psychology behind each of the characters and how each of them try to carve their way in order to find a bigger purpose in their existence despite the burden of the dark pages of their life)...which gives this film an extra soul that is everything but insignificant and takes its story to a higher level. In the end, the movie offers a pretty organic trajectory to all the main characters ; and it gives a lot of sense and meaning to what we just saw as well as future of these characters and the Marvel Cinematic Universe moving forward (the two post-credit scenes give you some more of that taste while obviously inviting you to watch the new future stories to come)... Purely delightful and quite satisfying overall ! Definitely.",

            "review": "I'll keep it short, but there's a lot to say here. Despite all the hype, I found the film to be largely underwhelming, especially when it came to one of the most anticipated characters: Sentry. Fans had been speculating for months about his role, imagining how his arrival would shift the balance of power in the MCU and introduce a truly complex, unstable force to the narrative. Instead, what we got was a watered-down version of the character with little substance and even less impact. Sentry didn't bring anything new or compelling to the table. His screen time was limited, his backstory was glossed over, and his powers, while visually impressive at moments, ultimately felt hollow because there was no emotional or narrative weight behind them. It was a classic case of style over substance, and the result was disappointing.On the flip side, Florence Pugh was absolutely amazing. She continues to be a standout in everything she does, and this film was no exception. Her character brought much-needed energy and charisma to every scene she was in. There's a natural authenticity in her performance that makes her incredibly watchable. Whether she was delivering dry humor or engaging in intense action sequences, she was always believable and grounded. She managed to rise above the script and direction, giving the audience something to actually care about. If there was one redeeming aspect of the film, it was her.Unfortunately, even Florence's strong performance couldn't save the film from feeling like a very big anti-climax. The buildup promised so much-massive stakes, game-changing reveals, and emotional payoff. But what we got instead was a third act that fizzled out rather than exploded. It was all far too safe, far too predictable. It felt like the writers were more interested in setting up future projects than giving this story a satisfying conclusion. Key moments that should have been shocking or powerful just kind of... happened, and then moved on. There was no time to process or feel anything, and that left the entire experience feeling emotionally flat.The post-credit scene was the final nail in the coffin. Predictable and uninspired, it felt like something we've seen a dozen times already. Instead of giving us a tantalizing glimpse of what's to come or throwing in a twist to get people talking, it simply reinforced what we already knew. It was more of a checklist item than a genuine hook. At this point, Marvel's post-credit scenes are starting to feel obligatory rather than exciting, and this one was no exception.And perhaps the most disappointing part of all was the film's over-reliance on the tired \"power of friendship\" trope. That theme can be powerful when executed well, but here it felt forced and unearned. Characters who barely had chemistry or meaningful development were suddenly treating each other like lifelong allies. There was no gradual build-up, no significant shared experiences that would justify the level of trust and emotional weight the film tried to place on their relationships. It came across as a lazy shortcut to emotional payoff, rather than something the characters or the audience had actually earned.In the end, this film had potential. It had great actors, intriguing characters, and the chance to do something bold. But instead, it played it safe and leaned on formulaic writing and hollow spectacle. With a better script and stronger direction, it could have been a standout entry. But as it stands, it's just another forgettable installment that will be quickly overshadowed by what's coming next.",

The film tackled mental health in a way I wasn't expecting, reminding us that bottling everything up isn't the answer. Instead, it encouraged facing your struggles, surrounding yourself with people who truly care, and letting them lift you up when you need it most.Of course, it wasn't all serious. David Harbour brought the humor with his signature one liners, making sure things stayed fun. What I thought would be just another MCU letdown turned into something that actually stuck with me. Maybe, just maybe, the franchise still has some surprises left.",

But we got rushed backstory, bad filmed action scenes that sometimes are really boring and feeling that it's not Marvel we know and love.I didn't feel involved in the movie, I didn't feel deeper connection with any of characters. The emotional side was not done interesting and it's bad, because it was supposed -i think so- to be really important.I can't even tell I'm glad they show us the problems of depression, loneliness, darkness inside of everyone, because it wasn't treated in the right way.Wasted potential.",

            "review": "It's no secret that the MCU hasn't had a good movie (excepting Guardians 3) since Endgame, and even Endgame was more of a resolution than a great movie unto itself. The new phase has varied from mediocre to bad to Quantumania (a movie so bad, that I believe it should be it's own adjective). The one exception (G3) is more a remnant of the old era than part of the new.This is why I think alot of people are overpraising Thunderbolts, which is a nice solid movie...but is hardly amazing. If this had come out during the MCU's glory days, it would have felt like a solidly average movie by MCU standards. It would stand alongside Thor 1 or Cap 1 or Black Panther as \"yup, that's another MCU movie\". But surround it with the recent Falcon movie, Dr. Strange 2, Eternals, and so on and Thunderbolts stands tall and proud by comparison.IMHO, the best things about this movie are the actors/characters. Especially Florence Pugh, David Harbour, and Julie Louis-Dreyfus. I'd like to give Sebastian Stan a shoutout, but did Bucky really do anything but flex and look like the adult in a group of bickering children?But that is what used to make the MCU great. The MCU movies were never elite scripts/plots. They were basic fun action/comedy/spectacle movies with fun, bright characters played by actors with charisma and charm. And despite Ghost and US Agent being pretty bland, the movie mostly delivers. JLD does well as the scenery chewing villainess, Pugh and Harbour are priceless in this, as they were in Black Widow. It's still an absolute crime that Disney sat on it's thumbs and wasted it's shot at a good Black Widow movie, only producing one far too late.I also want to give the movie credit for doing a very cliche thing with the respect to Sentry, but doing it in a way that felt earned and believable, when it very easily could have been eye-rollingly stupid. If you've seen the movie, I suspect you can guess what I mean, but I don't want to spoil anything.There definitely are some moments where characters know things they shouldn't know, or where power levels seem inconsistent. I'm not going to claim it's a 'clean' movie in that respect. Some things occurred that were a bit too 'just so'. But there weren't any that took me out of the movie...except one. I really didn't like how omnipotent Sentry was from a 'super soldier program'. Every other super soldier program produced low tier super-people. Sentry was Superman+. This seems orders of magnitude beyond others, and makes it hard to swallow that there won't be a billion such programs going forward.I think the humor was okay, but not excellent. The action setpieces were fine...but seldom as impressive as some of the MCU's past offerings.I think the only person in this that really inspires 'hero' is Yelena...the others kind of all feel like joke characters. Even Bucky, despite being portrayed consistently seriously and competent doesn't really feel like a part of a headliner group...which is part of the point of course. But I feel like that lack of a standout hurts going forward. Heck, Yelena's best showcase really comes in a weak movie alot of people skipped (Black Widow) and a streaming series that even more people skipped (Hawkeye).So basically, good movie, I enjoyed it, but let's keep the praise reasonable.",

            "review": "Marvel's new film debuted in theaters with low expectations and no box office rivals.When I say low expectations, I'm talking about the general public and all the people who have abandoned the MCU ship in recent years, and not without reason. After all, the vast majority of projects haven't been entirely convincing, especially on the television front.The box office failure and critical acclaim of the last Captain America film didn't help the hype either.However, we have a film that shines brightly. It's been a long time since we've had a Marvel film that didn't need others and their connections to be popular.There's a breath of fresh air, and the MCU has the opportunity to capitalize on it.The premise is a simple film; the execution stands out quite a bit above average.While it greatly develops the characters of Yelena and Bob, and not so much others like Ghost or Bucky, we have a strong plot and a transition during the first two acts that keep us on edge and entertained.A particular fear I had was the inclusion of Red Guardian and his humor, which had already failed me in previous projects. However, here he contributes, and that's appreciated.The third act is very risky. We were coming off the Captain America movie, where, thanks to the power of the script, he was able to face Red Hulk. Here, at first glance, it seems that the power of friendship is what resolves the plot, but this is more than that... for me, everyone's embrace of Bob is the catharsis of acceptance. That's why I loved the third act so much, and I didn't miss the blows or epic battles. Anyone who has suffered from deep depression knows that no matter how hard you fight and try day after day against that emptiness that drags you down, often only those around you know that you are more than the shadow you appear to be. Accepting your condition, accepting that trying to overcome it has never worked, but rather, on the contrary, eats away at you and separates you from society even more. When you're like this, you realize that embracing it and seeking help to reach that embrace is the only thing that can save you. That depression is a part of you, and instead of trying to beat it down, the best thing is to accept it and learn to live with it.Maybe I'm overanalyzing this last part, but it really seems much deeper to me than thinking that the script could have resolved everything.Even at the end, we have time for the writers to show us an effective way to limit a character's power, and not with the classic \"I was on another planet when all this happened,\" as they did perfectly with Sentry, \"If I unleash my power, I'll also unleash that monster.\" Simply brilliant.At the end, there are two post-credits scenes, one of which has a direct connection to \"Fantastic 4\" and which opens the debate to many questions about what we'll see in July.I sincerely appreciate what Marvel did with \"Thunderbolts*,\" now I wait for what's next.",

The storyline follows a California transplant living in New York who agrees to watch his neighbor's cat while the man is away caring for his sick father. Soon, a series of strangers begin showing up at his apartment, demanding to know his neighbor's whereabouts, and subjecting him to brutal beatings and torture in the process. What are they after-and can he find a way to help them before he, and everyone he knows, ends up dead?This picture is directed by Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream) and stars Austin Butler (Elvis), Zoë Kravitz (The Batman), Matt Smith (House of the Dragon), Liev Schreiber (Scream), and Regina King (The Harder They Fall).The story is clever and unpredictable, often feeling like a Guy Ritchie crime caper-but rooted deeply in a gritty, authentic New York setting. The cast delivers elite performances, and the plot is packed with sharp twists and turns. The cinematography and camera angles are equally impressive, enhancing the tension and style throughout.The action is top-tier: abrupt fight scenes, thrilling car chases, sudden bursts of gore, and intense shootouts that all land with impact. Even the subplots, particularly those tied to the chases and crashes, are smartly executed. The ending is immensely satisfying, and the soundtrack is brilliant.In conclusion, Caught Stealing isn't perfect, but it's an unpredictable and worthwhile rollercoaster of violence, intensity, and action. I'd score it a strong 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it.",

Just after the surgery, his girlfriend gravely informs him he'll have to give up alcohol, which he'd been drowning in after the death of a friend. But just a couple of scenes later, he's not only walking around like nothing happened and still lusting after his partner-he's also back at the bar getting wasted. From that point on, both the missing kidney and the alcoholism vanish from the script. Just one of the many delightful absurdities this movie serves up.The so-called 1990s New York setting is as sloppy as the rest, and the few interesting bits play like a tired mash-up of characters stolen from Guy Ritchie or Coen brothers films-minus any of their talent or wit.Poor Butler is stuck with a charisma-free role, shapeshifting from sexy man-child to half-baked hero without reason or logic.

            "review": "Jerry Bruckheimer is 81 years old, and somehow still cranking out the exact same movie - and selling it. Time and again, he brings in directors who fully bend to his vision, making his movie instead of their own.The case of F1 is a particularly clear echo. Back in 1986, Bruckheimer tapped then-little-known Tony Scott to direct Top Gun. Four years later, he brought Scott back for Days of Thunder, which was basically Top Gun with NASCAR. Fast forward to 2022, and it's Joseph Kosinski who remakes Top Gun, beat for beat, as Top Gun: Maverick. Now, in F1, Bruckheimer teams up with Kosinski again - and sure enough, it's Top Gun: Maverick, but with Formula 1 cars.At a certain point, it feels like an insult to the audience's intelligence. But in truth, Bruckheimer has long understood something most Hollywood producers only pretend to: audiences don't mind watching the same movie over and over, as long as it's shiny enough. And to his credit, the production values do keep getting better.The racing sequences in F1 are undeniably stunning. The opening stretch offers fresh, immersive angles that genuinely make you sit up. That sensation wears off, but the racing remains the movie's strongest element. Everything else - the character moments, the romance, the bromance - mostly feels like filler while you wait for the next lap.It gets repetitive. A little boring. Occasionally silly. But the technical craft keeps it from ever fully derailing. Brad Pitt and Javier Bardem both deliver solid performances, even if the script gives them very little to work with.",

            "review": "F1: The Movie is a new sports film directed, co-written, and produced by Joseph Kosinski, known for Tron: Legacy and Top Gun: Maverick.Promising Formula 1 driver Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) ended his career in the 1990s after a serious accident. Still, he continued to race as a hired driver.When team boss Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem) is in search of a new driver for his Formula 1 team, he turns to Sonny for help. Sonny agrees, but insists on racing in his own way.He is paired with Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), the young talent on the team, and their styles and experiences clash. Still, the two must find a way to work together to give their team a shot at victory.Following his success with Top Gun: Maverick, in which Joseph Kosinski made audiences feel as if they were right there in the cockpit with Tom Cruise, he tries to achieve the same with F1. And indeed: the racing scenes are impressively shot, at times making you feel like you're actually inside Brad Pitt's race car. Visually, the film certainly impresses.However, F1: The Movie is less innovative when it comes to its story. The plot of an older, headstrong driver having to inspire or challenge the younger generation has already been seen in films like Le Mans '66 (Ford v Ferrari) and Rush. F1 seems to combine elements from these predecessors, but as a result, doesn't create a truly original or distinctive narrative.Despite the high pace of the races, the film includes several slow moments. Or the opposite: the transitions between races can be so abrupt that it becomes hard to follow. The plot remains fairly predictable, often making it easy to sense where things are headed.As with Top Gun: Maverick, many cast members performed their own stunts. Brad Pitt and Damson Idris drove the actual race cars themselves, with stunt drivers only used for dangerous scenes-though this is hardly noticeable on screen.Still, F1 doesn't quite replicate the same realistic feeling as Top Gun: Maverick, where Tom Cruise did all his stunts himself. His familiar face and physical presence were always visible, which contributed to the immersion. That sense of presence is less consistently achieved in F1.",

            "review": "In 2022, Joseph Kosinski's 'Top Gun Maverick' took the world by storm. A sequel to Tony Scott's 1986 classic, the Tom Cruise starrer took in over $1.496 billion worldwide, the highest grossing Cruise vehicle to date. Praised by critics and audiences alike, it was widely seen as the film that reignited the global box office after the COVID-19 shutdowns, with Steven Spielberg calling it the saviour of \"the entire theatrical industry.\"Kosinski's directorial follow-up, 'Spiderhead,' flew under the radar, not offering much (other than a great Chris Hemsworth performance). His newest effort, 'F1' desperately wants to be 'Top Gun Maverick.' The narrative is essentially the same, but swaps the skies for the pits. It follows renegade racer Sonny Hayes, who is brought out of retirement to mentor a hot-headed young prodigy and help turn a struggling team into contenders. Amidst tension in the garage and friction on the track, can Hayes beat the odds?If it sounds familiar, that's because it is. For a film about one of the most exciting and fast-paced sports there is, 'F1' is shockingly dull and predictable. Clearly aimed at the same audience that loved the electrifying dog-fights of 'Top Gun: Maverick,' it is a non-starter in nearly every regard: a film about speed that never gets out of first gear. The narrative isn't just derivative of the Cruise blockbuster- it also echoes dozens of sports films where a grizzled veteran returns for one last shot at redemption.Full of cliches, stilted dialogue and cardboard cut-out characters, it lacks the excitement of John Frankenheimer's masterful 'Grand Prix,' the tension of Lee H. Katzin's 'Le Mans', the bravado of Tony Scott's 'Days of Thunder' and the fun of Gordon Chan's 'Thunderbolt,' as well as the emotion of Sydney Pollack's admittedly troublesome 'Bobby Deerfield.'Although Pollack's film was- and still is- by no means spectacular, it boasts far more interesting, multi-dimensional characters than Kosinski and co-writer Ehren Kruger came up with. Sonny is a walking cliché, who is about as compelling and well-rounded as a blank piece of paper. Neither he, nor any of his supporting characters, display any growth over the course of the film, and the emotional stakes are contrived.Further, the interactions between said characters lack spark or authenticity, as if torn from a 'Screenwriting Guidebook for Dummies'. Conversations trudge along, weighed down by stilted, on-the-nose lines, hammering home the obvious. Instead of feeling like real people with real conflicts, the characters merely recite plot points, leaving every exchange flat and lifeless. The film's attempts at emotional depth fall embarrassingly short, drowning under a tide of awkward exposition and contrived banter.Technically, the film has a lot more to offer. Fast-paced and frequently gripping, 'F1' boasts dynamic camerawork from Claudio Miranda, brilliantly capturing the adrenaline of a race. Furthermore, the crisp editing from Stephen Mirrione and Patrick J. Smith heightens the visceral nature of proceedings. Some of the races are pulse-poundingly intense and beautifully caught on camera; they'll have you on the edge of your seat.Additionally, the atmospheric sound design immerses one fully in the roar of engines and screech of tires. Hans Zimmer's score is evocative and thrilling, amplifying the tension and excitement throughout. The soundtrack also features a handful of great songs from the likes of Led Zeppelin and Queen (though they're never used to their full potential- often dropped in with little impact and quickly faded out). However, all these technical elements combine to create an undeniably exciting sensory experience- if only the story and characters were as finely tuned.Brad Pitt stars as Hayes, a role that asks little more of him than to look cool. No one can do that better than Pitt, but charisma alone can only carry a character so far. His talents are wasted on a part that offers no real nuance, development or dramatic challenge. His supporting cast- stacked with skilled performers like Kerry Condon, Damson Idris, Kim Bodnia and Javier Bardem (as well as Shea Whigham in a glorified cameo)- is similarly shortchanged, each saddled with one-note roles of little to no depth.Despite all the noise, 'F1' never finds its footing. It's a film that looks the part, sounds the part and moves like a blockbuster- but under the hood, it's running on empty. Director Joseph Kosinski clearly knows how to orchestrate spectacle, but spectacle without soul only gets you so far. With a flat script and hollow characters, not even a star as magnetic as Brad Pitt can steer it to victory. In trying so hard to replicate the triumph of 'Top Gun: Maverick,' 'F1' fails to blaze its own trail, ending up stalled at the starting line.",

A dark comedy with Benedict C and Olivia C sounded good, so off to the cinema we went (parents + 17 yo son).What an incredibly boring and painfully unfunny failure this turned out to be. Both partners in the couple were just unbearably annoying and selfish, how they could have ever fallen for each other remained a mystery. Their supposed ascerbic British wit, apparently hugely exotic for Americans, was neither clever nor funny - it just felt off (I generously add a point to my score for the scene at the marriage counsellor, which I found mildly amusing).They also had an exceedingly poor taste in friends - I would honestly rather slit my wrists than spend an evening with any of them and Amy in particular. Even their US marine corps type children where annoying. The premise of a comedy about a marriage gone bad because of the shifting fortunes of the partners and a bitterly fought divorce holds a lot of promise. But unfortubately none of the characters were remotely believable, likeable or interesting, and the same goes for the dialogue. Worst of all: while the film clearly aimed to be a comedy it was just simply not funny.When the lights went on again we all just laughed about how unbelievably stupid this film is and debated which of the characters we hated most.Razzie-worthy so Ivy better take her EpiPen with her.",

It is genuinely hilarious, sweet and tragic all at the same time.I won't give away the ending, but while it makes some changes to how the 1989 version ended, it also doesn't take away its cautionary tale aspect. It is also hugely critical of the material wealth that people accumulate when they become successful with their jobs.The two leads have great chemistry and work excellently together.

The husband, a suave architect turned stay-at-home dad, is weirdly weakened, his charisma undercut by odd choices. The wife, funny and talented, just doesn't match his polish, making their pairing feel off. Some dark humor hits, but clunky lines about cultural baggage or male confidence grate more than they amuse. This 2025 take strays far from Warren Adler's 1981 novel, a vicious, apolitical satire of marriage gone wrong. The 1989 film nailed that raw edge, but this version's modern spin-loaded with social commentary-would likely have Adler fuming. It feels like a classic story twisted to chase trends.

The scene in the rifle range meant to be funny was totally offensive in view of the ongoing violence.The script writers Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara's overuse of \"f\" and \"c\" bombs that were never necessary in the original movie that starred Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner really added to my dislike this ugly movie.It's so disappointing to see such talented actors star in what for me was a total waste of time and talent.An amendment- there was one likeable character - THE WHALE.",

I loved the original and was happy to see an update and prepared for the ride. Unfortunately, this version was a disappointment in spite of Benedict Cumberbatch's top notch performance after so many other incredible performances in an impressive resume of films. He made this charactor his own and he eats up the screen in every scene he is in. I would have rated the film a 9 if we could stop there. But we can't. I am shocked to say that Olivia Colman (who I have loved in everything I've seen her in...up till now, is so miscast and the charactor is so anoying, it ruins the movie. This story and the original movie, vollys happiness, love, disappointment, and hatred back and forth between the 2 main charactors and you get that with Cumberbatche's performance. I can't say the same for Coleman. Right from the very start, the attaction between the two charactors is not believeable. Coleman is a great actress, but the miscasting is so distracting It made her scenes difficult to watch. Andy Samberg's supporting role is unremarkable as well Kate McKinnon as his wife. Her is supposed to be amusing, but her rehashed SNL charactorization doesn't work anymore than believing these two are a couple.

            "review": "Reimagining a classic film can be tricky business, especially when it involves one that's well-liked and well-known. But, with the right team behind such a project, the result can be positively delightful, and such is definitely the case with this reworking of the 1989 dark comedy, \"The War of the Roses.\" In fact, in this case, I'd even go so far as to say that this new production is actually an improvement over its often-overrated predecessor. Director Jay Roach's scathingly biting comedy follows the lives of Theo and Ivy Rose (Benedict Cumberbatch, Olivia Colman), a pair of successful British professionals who quickly fall madly in love, marry and resettle in northern California, eventually becoming the proud parents of two children. Theo is an accomplished architect, while Ivy is a gifted but underconfident chef who concocts spectacular culinary creations that only her family gets to sample. However, when Theo lands a plum contract to design a museum, he comes into a windfall whose proceeds he gifts to Ivy to launch her own eatery. As fate would have it, though, the partners' fortunes trade places, with Ivy becoming a huge hit that leads to the opening of a chain of restaurants and Theo's career taking an unexpected tumble, relegating him to the role of househusband as he struggles to revive his sagging reputation. This invariably leads to mounting petty jealousies and intensifying marital discord between two spouses who ostensibly once seemed to love one another deeply - and all with wickedly hilarious results. So what makes this version of the Roses' story better than its forerunner? Several factors play into this, but nearly all of them are tied to the vastly improved writing at work here compared to the original. The scope of the narrative has been significantly enlarged in this iteration, and all to the better, primarily due to the inclusion of an array of colorful supporting characters and a diverse palette of genuinely sidesplitting scenarios. In addition, the dialogue is crisper, snappier and faster paced, enabling the story to flow more like a screwball comedy than an embittered, often-dour and frequently nasty exercise. That's not to suggest the lack of an edge in this updated production; quite the contrary. But the pacing, delivery and contents of its inspired and devastatingly hard-hitting one-liners are virtually nonstop, giving the picture a rapid-fire immediacy that its predecessor frequently lacked. Those qualities are further enhanced by sharper character development and the award-worthy spot-on performances of the two leads, whose undeniable chemistry makes their portrayals even more compellingly on target. Add to that the incisive contributions of the film's fine ensemble (most notably Kate McKinnon, Andy Samberg and Allison Janney), and you've got a cinematic formula that truly fires on all cylinders. Admittedly, there are a few elements that could have been handled a little differently, and some aspects of the screenplay feel a little overwritten at times, but these shortcomings are so minor that they're hardly worth mentioning. Considering how well everything meshes in this production, I must confess that I'm somewhat surprised the picture was saddled with a late August release, typically one of the movie industry's distribution wastelands. I was also concerned in advance that this could have turned out to be another of those misguided remakes that have come to characterize many of filmdom's high-profile releases these days. But \"The Roses\" delivers the goods across the board and genuinely deserves an appreciative audience for its efforts as one of 2025's better offerings, especially in the comedy genre. Don't let preconceptions stand in your way of giving this one a look - you won't regret it.",

            "review": "LIKES:\nThe Dialogue\nThe Humor\nThe Tactics\nThe Messages\nThe Cinematography\nThe Acting\nSummary:\nA remake of a classic requires either precision to the material with a new artistic style, or a meaningful twist worthy of making the new movie. The Roses does a bit of both, but leans heavily into the second part to try and give something fresh to the classic tale of a lover's spat gone horribly wrong. Roach's vision is very articulate and comedy-heavy, focusing on integrating British dialogue delivery with two very distinct comedy styles. The dialogue is smart, blending British colloquialisms with American aggression into a sizzling sandwich of stylish humor. It offers varying degrees of mature comedy, doing their best to get a laugh as each member brings their own brand of laughs into the film. And to have deeper moments that feel authentic and not just a simple SNL sketch fest, which I was worried it could be. But the movie is very tactful with the humor and writing, always keeping this classic tale alive despite the new directions it chose. Those tactics further show up as the story progresses to the \"peak\" of tension, a new set of cunning tactics to evolve the disdain that injects more humor into this exaggerated argument turned very morose. I won't say much to avoid spoilers, but the modernization works well to poke fun at the new-age attitudes that you see fill up social media platforms, and I had fun with some of the new twists they chose to include. And yet, within all this chaotic comedy, the film holds onto the underlying message of marriage and what can tax a relationship with all the pressures of high success it brings. It might be buried under a lot of things, but this installment, I think, accomplishes a lot in demonstrating just what emotions, thoughts, attitudes, and reactions to such a relationship can bring, as well as the complicated concepts of hard work that love brings with it through the difficult times, especially with these key moments where everything comes together.Speaking of coming together, the actual craft of the movie gains points in regard to how the movie comes together for me. The Roses may not be fully state-of-the-art, nor design some of the most unique worlds capable of high-fantasy royalty. However, the movie is shot well, with beautiful camera work helping get all the right shots to give you the full majesty of the scene in terms of emotion and comedic prowess. I loved those moments where you get this facial profile that holds so much beneath the skin as they convey the feelings boiling within. Or when you get this exchange of characters around a table, where tensions start to mount, and the actions that come with it are just as ludicrous as the behavior in public. The Roses' camera teams get it all on film, with editing that helps pull it all together in a well-crafted film. But the acting is the biggest benefit for this reviewer, holding much of the heart of this film and conveying what the War of the Roses' plot is all about. Every actor does their part, a certain character qualm that is often a single-toned character that exists for a comedic opening and little more. McKinnon and Andy Samberg have a bit more layering to them, primarily comedic with their SNL style of aggressive one-liners, awkward banter, and over-the-top emphasis to make many chuckle if you like such stressed and zany lines. However, they do have those nuggets of emotional treasure I mentioned earlier, elements I wish I had gotten just a bit more of to give me a better balance and more meaningful drive to the end. It's the leads who have the most complexity for me, both having this complex mixture of dramatic flair, authentic anger, and wit, with an expert level of artistry that I absolutely feel into. They have such great chemistry, somehow managing to step into every facet of this complex comedy, always keeping in time with the scene, but still giving it their all. It's a wonderful display of balance, doing their best with the spectrum of comedic styles this movie required of them. This relationship is the key to enjoying this movie, and it is a blessing to have these leads do the impossible.DISLIKES:\nVery Somber Material\nVicious\nToo Dry For Some\nImbalance Of Characters\nCrosses Lines\nThe Language Is Very Aggressive\nNiche Comedy\nSummary\nWhere the movie is going to be a turn off for some is going to come in the very cynical nature of the material. The Roses movie deals with a lot of hard material, the relationship itself holding lots of triggering moments that may be hard for an audience member to watch. Such somber material may be hard to handle, and the negative emotions do sort of slow things down and might not be entertaining when you are getting subjected to how much is layered in this couple's love. It's vicious, with some actions and words perhaps being too much to bear with what is said. Sensitive viewers need to be warned that some awful things might be said without a sincere apology to make it better, and if that enrages you, this movie again is a trigger. And as things heat up, the viciousness crosses into levels that only dark humor appreciates or those who love a really good Soap Opera Diva. If that isn't enough to dissuade you, I also didn't enjoy the saturation of coarse language, the choices of insults, yelling, and other words that check a lot of boxes on my list that I don't like. Such aggressive language is often paired with actions that cross a lot of lines, and I warn sensitive viewers that sometimes they take it a tad too far with this rendition, which I found myself wondering if I would stay.Once you get past the darker material, the other thing to remember is that this is a very dry movie, with comedy that sometimes is aggressive, silly, and inappropriate, with a more direct approach, but a lot of it has that touch of British approach that may be too stiff. If you don't enjoy such antics, I won't say this movie isn't for you, but you might not want to have a film where you have to think a bit about the banter or wrap your head around how far they are willing to go. And if you are going for a particular star, this also felt like a limitation to me, primarily because of how imbalanced the character usage was. The leads are the stars for much of the movie, with Samberg and McKinnon having the next greatest time level. However, other stars are going to kind of get the shaft, again, primarily as comedic relief or an opening with only a few jokes to get the ball rolling. The story feels a bit chopped up as well, and perhaps a bit more character integration and focus on the tale could have helped mitigate some of these issues. Finally, the movie feels very niche; the combination of all these comedic styles with the very morose plot narrows the audience who might enjoy this down to a much smaller audience.The VERDICT:\nThe Roses is an interesting twist to the classic material, with a heavy comedy focus to help make the movie relevant in the modern world. A fantastic acting duo is the star of this movie, helping to deliver complex comedy, authentic relationships, animosity to no avail, and still drop the witty dialogue that is written in this movie. The solid writing, decent pacing, and multiple styles keep things moving, helping find those small moments of relief in this intense film, and all with a great cinematic atmosphere that movies do well. However, the wit of this film, the intelligent comedy, and direction may only cater to a limited audience. The Roses film is a dryer piece to enjoy, requiring strong fortitude for the material, handling the very unhealthy elements our \"heroes\" choose to pursue, and being desensitized to the aggressive language that this film was not afraid to run into. All of these aggressive elements are potential triggers, and I encourage everyone to be very cautious before choosing to handle this film. Is it worth a trip to the theater? While there is a lot of good, most are going to want to keep to home viewing for this film. Upon factoring that element in, I give The Roses:Tragedy/Comedy/Satire: 8.0\nMovie Overall: 7.0.",

            "review": "Body horror is a genre that can be difficult to nail. At its best, it is anxiety-inducing, disturbing, and off-putting, often beyond the point of enjoyment. It is horror, not because of the scary monsters or hidden nightmares, but because of the natural human unease towards bodies being bent and broken in ways they shouldn't. As a horror genre fan, I have become desensitized to most of the tactics used to scare in movies, but body horror, done right, never fails.Together is almost that movie. It builds anxiety both through body horror and simple awkwardness, but just as it rises to the point of being unbearable, it breaks the tension, either with humor or romance. It does this well, but I was left feeling too comfortable, too comfortable for a movie purporting to be a genre based on the opposite. If they had leaned into the body horror more, unwilling to break, this could've been exceptional, but as it stands, I was left wanting.For someone who is easily scared or is new to body horror, this film could be great. The humor and romance make it more approachable, but it also detracts from the horror. Certainly not a waste of time, but it sucks to see a film come so close only to miss the mark.",

The ending contains much ambiguity, which might not work for some. But I liked it. I think the film leaves a lot of room for interpretation about what happens. Whether the ending is happy or tragic, for example, is debatable, and even I feel that I could frame an argument for both sides.I found both of the leads - Alison Brie and Dave Franco - to be great. Their acting is smooth, and their characters are likable enough as protagonists. They have great romantic chemistry (some might respond by saying, \"Well duh, they're a real-life couple.\" But I've actually seen movies where real-life couples don't have on-screen chemistry; real-life relationships don't always translate on-screen. Both of them deserve credit for their performances in this movie).The movie is billed as a horror/comedy. And I guess there are some dialogue and embarassing situations that could be taken as comedy. But as a whole, I really found the movie to be more of a straight horror. And there are some creepy and unsettling moments. The gore is also not as extreme as I had heard. I never grimaced or felt the need to look away; there's no reliance on shock in this movie. The movie's pacing is good, and the run-time is just right.In terms of flaws -- the film introduces a friendly teacher at Alison Brie's job. The movie basically telegraphs that he knows more than he's letting on. There's a certain VHS scene that feels a little bit contrived; the film seems to jam that scene to explain stuff in as little time as possible. Additionally, I didn't quite grasp the backstory about Dave Franco's motherStill - a very good movie. It's not a knock-off, but this movie reminded me quite a lot of The Substance because of the general vibe (as well as a certain monster) .

A grotesque, clever, and oddly funny little gem that had me cringing, laughing, and totally hooked the entire time.The concept is unhinged in the best way: a couple moves to the countryside... and starts getting TOO attached. What unfolds is what I can best describe as a rom-com body horror (yes, really) that somehow makes co-dependency literal... and it weirdly works. So well.Body horror isn't for everyone, but this is so well done. The practical effects are gnarly in the best way - just the right amount of gross to make your stomach turn while keeping you glued to the screen. It leans into the absurdity, but underneath the chaos is a surprisingly honest look at toxic love, compromise, and identity.Alison Brie and Dave Franco are absolutely fantastic. You totally buy into them as a couple who love each other but maybe shouldn't be together. Or maybe should? I don't even know. That's part of the fun.And I have to say - any film shot in Melbourne gets an automatic bonus point from me. There's something so satisfying about seeing our suburbs twisted into something this surreal.Cringey in all the right ways. Disgusting in the best possible sense.

The body horror and supernatural elements are there, but they could've gone harder with it.The trailer gave away a lot, so if you've seen it, you've probably already caught most of the big horror moments. That takes away some of the surprise, which is a shame, because the film does have its own story to tell. It's straightforward and easy to follow.What worked really well was the emotional side of it.

            "review": "Together was ultimately a very frustrating experience for me, because for every piece of genuinely interesting filmmaking and concepts from writer/director Michael Shanks, there's an equal amount of horror cliches that I've already seen a hundred times. This isn't really helped by the fact that the \"twist\" is straight up spoiled by every piece of marketing material, despite the movie trying it's best to throw whatever doubt it can during the first act. When it actually gets into actually exploring the body horror, it becomes somewhat interesting again, with a healthy mix of genuine squeamishness and black comedy, although it's far from being the most graphic or disturbing offering in this subgenre.The acting is generally fine, but does get underminded by the script shoehorning in some of the most obvious foreshadowing of all time. I did find Dave Franco's performance the most amusing since he ends up whipping out a discount Jesse Pinkman voice towards the end of the film, whether that was intentional or not.While I ultimately didn't hate my experience with Together, I do think that most people will probably end up coming out of this film disappointed, especially due to the intense hype of this supposedly being \"the scariest movie of the year\". I think that director Michael Shanks definitely has potential to make something truly great if he tries, since this is his debut full-length feature. Here's to hoping that Mr Shanks is able to find his own voice in cinema.",

            "review": "Together is the kind of film that feels like a paycheck project-where talented actors go through the motions, knowing that the script they're working with doesn't inspire much more than a paycheck. It's as if they showed up just to cover the bills, not because they're invested in bringing anything special to the table. The performances, while competent, lack the energy and passion you'd expect from the cast. These are actors capable of so much more, but here, they seem like they're simply clocking in for a job rather than embracing a role.The film's script is a mess of clichés and missed opportunities, failing to deliver anything fresh or engaging. The dialogue is predictable, and the plot feels like it's been recycled from a dozen other films that did it better. There's an attempt to create emotional depth and connection between the characters, but it falls flat because the writing doesn't give them enough substance to make those moments feel earned. The pacing drags, and you're left waiting for a spark that never quite ignites.What Together truly feels like is a film made for actors who needed to stay relevant-or just needed the cash. It's a forgettable experience, and unfortunately, it's a reminder that even good actors can struggle when they're working with material that doesn't give them room to shine.There's no heart or soul here. Just an empty vehicle for a cast who, frankly, deserve much better.",

            "review": "When real-life couples star together, the resulting film can take on a fascinating meta-layer. Although their offscreen bond doesn't necessarily blur into their characters, it inevitably hovers in the background. Mike Nichols' 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' wasn't simply a searing portrait of marital warfare; it was also Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, cinema's most famous spouses, sparring with a ferocity that audiences couldn't help but connect to their tempestuous private lives.Likewise, Stanley Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' wasn't just a puzzle about desire and fidelity. Echoed against the backdrop of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's highly publicized marriage, the couple's casting lent an extra layer of voyeuristic intrigue to the film. That extra-textual dimension doesn't alter the story, but it makes the fiction feel charged in ways it otherwise wouldn't.This is also the case with Michael Shanks' 'Together,' starring the real-life couple Dave Franco and Alison Brie. A body-horror à la Coralie Fargeat's 'The Substance,' the film follows long-time partners Tim and Millie, who have been drifting apart. After relocating to the countryside, they encounter a mysterious force that starts to reshape their lives, forcing them closer than ever. Soon, their romance becomes a macabre affair, as the boundaries between co-dependence and monstrosity irrevocably blur.Atmospheric, visceral and laced with dark humour, Shanks' film grips from start to finish. Essentially a Cronenbergian romantic comedy, it's bloody good fun, with some thematic weight. Shanks' narrative cleverly uses the language of body-horror to externalize the often-unspoken dynamics undermining relationships. More than an external threat, the disgusting entity that binds Tim and Millie embodies their neediness for, and resentment towards, one another.Horror has always excelled at making the abstract tangible- whether it be desire as parasite, or intimacy as contagion- and Shanks leans into that tradition with gory relish. In 'Together', the spectacle of skin and sinew isn't there for shock alone, but as a metaphor for how love can devour, how co-dependence can trap partners in a suffocating cycle of intimacy. As proceedings intensify, the couple's bond is forced into a crucible, revealing both the strength and fragility of their connection.Shanks' strong characterisation emphasises this point, especially when it comes to Tim. He is far from a traditional macho protagonist, being a vulnerable, tentative man marked by trauma. He can't work a compass or start a fire, and relies heavily on Millie in everyday situations. His hesitancy and fragility ground the film, making the couple's descent into grotesquerie more affecting than it otherwise might be.Millie, too, is drawn with nuance; a smart young teacher who loves Tim and wants the best for him, but whose patience sometimes frays under the weight of his insecurities. Together, they feel less like genre archetypes and more a realistic couple. Their exchanges throughout are natural, laced with a dry wit that feels true to life. At its core, the film is a love story, which works because one believes in Tim and Millie's bond- the tenderness beneath the terror.Visually, the film is as striking as it is unsettling. Germain McMicking's cinematography cloaks the rural setting in a pall of damp greys and muted greens, evoking both isolation and decay. Further, Nicholas Dare's production design makes the world feel intimate yet suffocating, deeply alive- disquietingly breathing.In addition, the effects work is impressively tactile, leaning on practical gore and prosthetics rather than CGI, giving things a raw, clammy immediacy. Shanks doesn't flinch from grotesque detail, yet the imagery never tips into gratuity. Just as crucial are the sound design and score: the former wringing dread from creaks, squelches and silences, the latter pulsing uneasily beneath the action without overwhelming it. Further, Sean Lahiff's editing is sharp and economical, ensuring every shock lands with precision.As Tim and Millie, Dave Franco and Alison Brie's real-life marriage lends their on-screen intimacy a raw authenticity, making Shanks' vision of closeness-turning-hideous even more disturbing. Both deliver powerhouse performances- Franco in particular, showing a vulnerability and range rarely glimpsed in his comedic work. Brie, meanwhile, plays Millie with a sharp mix of exasperation and tenderness, anchoring the film's emotional core. Damon Herriman also does fine work in a supporting role as Millie's work colleague Jamie, whose personable demeanour belies a hidden darkness.In conclusion, Michael Shanks' 'Together' is bloody great: a grisly reflection of intimacy, co-dependence and the messy realities of love. Dave Franco and Alison Brie work wonderfully together, grounding Shanks' Cronenbergian vision in something startlingly human. With tactile effects, evocative cinematography and a keen ear for dread, the film shows how passion can curdle into possession, with devastating consequences. In short, in the realm of body-horror, 'Together' stands apart.",

Fearing their power, Zeus split them into two separate parts, condemning them to spend their lives in search of their other halves.\" Plato, The SymposiumAlthough the current horror film Together doesn't pretend to parse Plato's discourse on love, it relies heavily on the idea that true love is the comingling of minds and bodies that were once separated by Zeus out of envy. Tim (David Franco) and Millie (Alison Brie) spend time in a country house seeking to regain the passion they once had.After a stroll that ends up in a cave (how very Platonic!), they devolve into maddened humans, literally getting under each other's skin. The visuals, even without excessive CGI, are body horror at its best, and allegorically land us in discussion about what love means and how it affects the struggling relationship the drama began with.Thematically Together wishes to show how much the stressed couple loves each other, even willing to sacrifice their very flesh to reconcile their affections. No couple in the audience can ignore the commentary on the emotional demands of love, the millennial fear of commitment, and the strains that modern lonely life make on romance.After all, Millie has sacrificed a higher teaching order to take a rural job while he is still at 35 years old trying to play in an indie-rock band. His intermittent impotency, while understandable given his lack of professional success, still seems like a major impediment to\ntaking their love to the next level.While treating the aud to some icky body horror, writer-director Michael Shanks comments on the challenges of modern living that needs the therapy of communal sharing, of overcoming horrors together to emerge from that cave together toward the future.",

            "review": "I really wanted to like this movie, and it hurts to say that it is actually very mid. It tries to be extremely high-stakes but forgets what made the best mission films so great-not only the action but also the characters. It's hard not to see that the plot is there just to fill the time between the key stunts. But I'd like to go into more detail, starting with what I liked.1. Cinematography and action. As usual, the cinematography is strong with this one. Some of the shots were jaw-dropping, hands down. The submarine underwater sequence is a masterclass in tension. I forgot all the problems I had with the plot while watching it. Truly beautiful. No matter the issues that I will list further, I still have a crazy respect for Tom Cruise doing this for real and bringing the best action possible.2. Benji. I absolutely love everything they did with this character. From being a nameless computer guy, to Ethan's close friend and partner, to actually becoming a co-leader with Ethan. Definitely well built and deserved.3. Some connections with previous movies felt nice; one even had a great message behind it. Though I have to say, it felt like the creators didn't trust the audience enough to recognise them. For example, when one of the characters was brought back from another M:I, Benji immediately started explaining who this guy was, which killed some of the joy for me, as a fan.But, even if I wouldn't call TFR a bad movie, it is a very flawed one.1. The whole \"CHOICE\" situation is stupid. It's never once foreshadowed in any of the first six movies, so it feels like a retcon. Why was this even needed? It brings nothing to the story apart from Grace joining the team, which could've been done in a dozen other ways.2. This movie has some of the heaviest exposition I've ever seen. It felt dragged a lot of times. Not Andor-slow, rather just dragged and pointless. Characters explain things all the time, repeating and finishing each other's sentences. And even with so much info being said, it still sometimes gets unclear who the villain is or what motivation/goals they have.3. We learn NOTHING about the Gabriel-Ethan relationship, which was teased so much in Part 1. Honestly, in the end, if Entity chose any other guy and not the one who happens to be Ethan's old enemy, nothing would've changed. Like absolutely nothing. What was the point of those flashbacks in Part 1? We have no idea what the situation was, who that woman was, why Gabriel killed her, or why Ethan was framed for it. It brings nothing new to Ethan's character. Also, Gabriel himself is boring. We know nothing about him, and if in theory, this could've been intimidating, in practice, it just makes him a poorly written villain. Why establish a detailed background and motivation for a character if we can just throw in the same flashback here and there and make Ethan panic when he sees him the first time in DR :) (I am not saying this franchise always had nuanced villains. It's an action blockbuster of all things. But Gabriel is just rock bottom.)4. Final fight with Gabriel didn't feel earned or satisfying, because Gabriel is probably one of the most passive villains I've ever seen. He makes some bald statements and runs away the whole movie. And when he finally gets defeated, the scene itself is straight out of the comedy genre, in a film that otherwise tries to be obnoxiously serious.5. Villains in this movie generally take minimal conscious action, so they do not feel intimidating or engaging. This is especially true of AI. It is hard to be afraid of it. AI enemy sounds cool on paper, but it doesn't really fit in Mission's formula. My concerns from watching DR were proven true. In the end, all we got was a race for an ultra-tech macguffin, which has to connect to other macguffin, which can be found by using another macguffin, only then to use the final macguffin at the right timing to defeat the Entity. Sounds stupid and boring? It is. That is the price for having the enemy you can't see in the media, where everything is based on seeing.6. Yes, some villains from other iterations might not have been top-level, but at least the characters around Ethan made the movie engaging. This brings us to secondary characters in this movie. Paris... Pom Klementieff did a great job, but she did not have a lot to work with, unfortunately. We do not learn anything new about her. I really wanted to see her character developed in this movie, but it's just a sad mess, honestly.7. Same goes for Degas. He showed signs of conscience, joined Ethan to save the world, and then completely disappeared from the plot.8. There is just too many side characters, especially in the government and military. Most of them don't even have names. They are just plot vessels, not actual people.9. Lite spoiler: In the film's first minutes, you get a montage of key moments from previous entries. That looked peak in the trailer, but watching it again in the actual movie felt very cheesy. I felt like watching a fan edit on TikTok, not a Hollywood blockbuster.10. That ending... Probably the worst Mission ending ever. Extremely cliche and lacks emotion. I can't believe this is all they came up with, especially considering this is supposed to be the ending of a 30-year-long journey.11. Probably the weakest soundtrack we got since MI3. Not a musician, so I won't be commenting on this, but subjectively it is definitely not as consistent and emotional as previous ones.For me, this movie can be best described by my favourite quote from Arcane. In pursuit of the highest stakes possible, more characters than ever, and the longest, most extreme stunts, they failed to deliver the characters that make the audience care, stunts that feel natural inside the plot, and a villain who is actually intimidating.",

Sorry, but that's just not good writing - it's exposition dumping.The rest is basically run-of-the-mill action sequences and plot devices that lead to a pretty predictable and not-very-exciting plot.

So, today when I entered the cinema my expectations were not so high. But throughout the movie I kept wondering when will the dull part begin!Instead, I got epic visuals, heartwarming human emotions, satisfying throwbacks for a long term MI fan. When the credit rolled I had nothing but respect for the makers, for the entire team, not just of this movie but for every movie since MI 1996.Overall, it might not top Mission Impossible Fallout but it will stay equally memorable to me. It did its job well which is to conclude the franchise in a spectacular way, without going over the top with action (think of Fast and Furious franchise).I surely liked it better than Dead Reckoning because there were more of likeable characters rather than annoying characters. It was like a bunch of good people coming together to fight a noble cause, something that was missing in the previous movie. Some people might find some of the scenes being too lengthy but I didn't mind all of the hard work being played a little longer than required. Watching Tom Cruise giving it his all was once again as thrilling as it was 25 (or so) years ago.As the movie said: our lives are the sum of our choices. Watching this movie was one of the best choice I ever made. So, if you are an MI fan don't miss this in cinema. It's going to be memorable, it's going to be epic!",

            "review": "Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning serves as the grandest and boldest farewell to arguably the greatest action franchise of all time. Yet, it lacks a true sense of finality.The film shoulders a colossal burden, attempting to deliver a worthy goodbye to Ethan Hunt and the iconic franchise. It aims to provide satisfying conclusions to a bloated roster of side characters while also setting up inevitable cash-grab sequels. Additionally, it strives to outdo every previous installment by going bigger and bolder than ever. While it excels in some areas, it falters in others.One of the film's biggest challenges is managing its vast ensemble of characters. The script occasionally struggles to balance them all, resulting in scenes where some characters randomly appear and disappear, seemingly out of convenience rather than logic. This inconsistency can be jarring, pulling the audience out of the experience.In typical Mission Impossible fashion, the film promises the most spectacular set pieces yet-and it delivers. These grand, meticulously crafted action sequences are thrilling to watch. However, their constant back-to-back presence somewhat dampens their impact. Once the audience becomes accustomed to the relentless spectacle, the element of surprise and tension starts to wane.The stunts, while still impressive, carry a bittersweet note. Unlike previous installments where Tom Cruise's daring feats were fully captured on camera, this time around, roughly half of the action scenes rely on noticeable green screen effects. Though understandable, given Cruise's age and safety precautions, it slightly detracts from the visceral thrill of witnessing genuine stunts, making the danger feel less real.Performance-wise, this installment shines, particularly with Angela Bassett delivering one of the most emotionally charged portrayals in the franchise. The script's emphasis on deeper emotions allows for some of the finest acting moments in the series.However, the editing feels somewhat sloppy, giving the impression that substantial material was left on the cutting room floor. While the brisk pacing keeps the film engaging, it sometimes feels as if we're only witnessing the start and end of scenes without the journey in between, leaving a sense of incompleteness. The cutting is fast, but not in an exhilarating manner-instead, it's disorienting.If this truly is the final goodbye to the Mission Impossible series, it's been an unforgettable ride. Despite its flaws, the franchise remains the pinnacle of action cinema in my book, and its legacy will undoubtedly endure for generations. I've said this before, and I'll say it again: we are witnessing a master at craft. Cherish it while you can.This message will self-destruct in five seconds.",

            "review": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is a bit of a disappointment, coming off the particularly high highs of Fallout and Dead Reckoning. The stakes are heightened narratively, with the end of the world being imminent throughout, but you don't often feel the desperation; you're mostly just told about it. And that's one of the things that holds this film back. It's so weighed down in exposition and dialogue scenes that aren't necessarily that much worse than such scenes in the other films in the series, but they're inferior enough that they start to drag. And there's not enough action here, which feels weird to say. There needed to be one more set piece, preferably during the first hour, because this is a long movie and the first hour or more is honestly a bit dull. The funny banter was also much less funny, when they even attempted humor. It's kind of a dour movie, which makes sense with the stakes, but also, I didn't really feel those stakes. So I would've rather just had that usual breezy team chemistry and joke-making.Speaking of stakes and showing things, I would've loved a set piece in a populated area? Or an action scene that felt more alive/crowded/in a place that felt real. In The Final Reckoning, there's an extended one with Cruise alone, one near the end (and on some of the posters for the film) involving some small planes, and then a handful of small shootouts and fist fights. There's nothing that's as big or as exciting as the whole train sequence in Dead Reckoning, and that film had some city action (plus a great car chase) and the whole airport scene. It's fresher in my mind than The Final Reckoning, even though I saw one two years ago and the other two hours ago. There's more tension and a feeling of danger when you can see civilization and bystanders, I think. And with everyone in the world being in danger because of the plot, it was weird to feel like no one (other than the main heroes and villains) was in danger during the action scenes.The finale of this movie is smaller scale, but that sequence is a knockout. It's almost worth the price of admission, but you do have to slog through some dreary stuff beforehand. The end of the world is nigh, but mostly you just hear about it, or some high-ranking government officials discuss things in board/bored rooms (and some of those scenes feel like if they were pushed into territory that was any more over-dramatic, we'd have Dr. Strangelove-esque comedy).The more I think about it, the more I realize this was kind of disappointing, even if I really loved the one big action scene that will, eventually, be the only thing I remember about this. I'm torn between like a 3/5 or a 3.5/5, and think I have to go more toward the former, just because this is too long for something with so little action. It needed to show more of the world, and we needed at least one sequence with more people and things in it. I feel like Dead Reckoning had about two or three times more great action than this, and the same can be said about Fallout. Dead Reckoning was a few minutes shorter, and Fallout was like half an hour shorter. Neither cost as much, but both felt more expensive. More bang for your buck watching those, and fewer bucks spent by the filmmakers to make them. The Final Reckoning feels pretty expensive, but not $300-400 million expensive.They got a little lazy with The Final Reckoning. They didn't get lazy in the couple of particularly flashy scenes, but they needed more big scenes and they shouldn't have had the film feel so empty. Too much telling, not enough showing. The lack of a consistent villain throughout hurt - Gabriel was a compelling presence in Dead Reckoning, but he's not in this one as much, disappearing for long stretches at a time.The Final Reckoning comes alive in parts. The plane stuff is thrilling. 90% of the movie, or maybe even a little more, fluctuates between being a tiny bit disappointing and very disappointing. I guess overall, I'm quite disappointed they couldn't keep the momentum going; these films had just kept getting better, from the second onwards, but no more.This really will be the Final one, I Reckon. Can't see it turning a profit, either.",

The beginning felt like an introduction, which might be necessary for first time mission impossible viewers, though quite repetitive for those who have seen Dead Reckoning. The flashbacks and flashforwards to explain the story was a lazy choice in my opinion and it was one the big negatives in this film. The whole story is constantly being explained leaving no room for mystery, some intrigue or some unpredictable moments. Actually it becomes almost annoying because the dialogue is just sloppy, leaving very little for the actors to work with. Fortunately some momentum is gained as the movie progresses, mainly from the stunts which are absolutely incredible and let's be honest, you probably won't find anything that comes close in any other type of media. Though this momentum doesn't last long because of all the explaining again and the bad guys seeming to be there only for show. What I'm trying to say is that Yes the action sequences are obviously the main selling point of MI but not the only one. An interesting story that keeps its viewers guessing is what separates an OK MI from a great MI. I don't know, maybe they messed up the editing?

The dialogue is average at best, and the excessive explanation of every plot point treats the audience as if they can't keep up.The editing also falls short, several shots feel disconnected, breaking the flow. The background score doesn't help either; it lacks impact and often feels mismatched. The sudden shift to \"you're humanity's last hope\" and the repetitive use of words like \"entity\" weaken the script. The writing lacks subtlety and starts to feel forced.

            "review": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is bombastic to put it mildly, given all the fast-paced exposition and visually resounding action setpieces.While after the Hitchcockian narrative of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, this concluding chapter somewhat may feel a bit inadequate - especially with all those lots of scenes in caves and lairs and prisons with no astoundingly risky turn - the highs are even higher than the lows seem lower. Let me tell you, everyone will be googling \"Mission Impossible 8 submarine scene\" a week for now.The underwater chapter is indeed breathtaking and quite original piece of filmmaking and a nice addition to M:I franchise which saves the movie big time. That 20-minute sequence with submarine is perhaps the most original piece of action written for action-oriented narratives since 1996's Mission: Impossible's own aqua cafe sequence between Ethan and Kittdridge, directed brilliantly by Brian De Palma. The suspense as Ethan so assiduously tackled all those aquatic, James Cameron-isque challanges was palpable. The realism and authenticity added the rest.Else, they have recycled tropes all over the place in order to pay homage - the gala which is rendered into a jail before the gathering itself is even exhibited - no fancy cars, garish costumes, stupendous decorum, dances, masks, bluetooth talk, etc. In here. I missed the trains as well.And narratively, there also exists this thing called predictability, and it's here to stay in the movie - the biggest weakness of The Final Reckoning. The movie is, perhaps, the least memorable for its twists - or the lack thereof - when compared to all the other M:I movies in the franchise, probably tied with Mission: Impossible 2. But that's not to say it is bad, or average or even above average - no! It's hella great!!In terms of action-based storytelling as well, this may seem like a step backwards from Mission: Impossible - Fallout. Most scenes, when considering the movie is nearly 3 hours long, is quite limited or superfluous otherwise. But all of that pays off in the final act, trust Mr. Cruise. Because that brings us to the biplane chase sequence.After 150 minutes of absolutely no motorcycles and cars chasing each other, though plenty of Cruise sprinting, the red and yellow old-school biplanes going after each other in South African skies is something that should adequately feed all the ravenous audiences. It's suspenseful, it's engaging, it's REALLY dangerous; though the villainous Gabriel character is still bland and bad, like the previous entry.The diversity, without throwing into our faces what their genders are, is probably the quintessential example of how these things should be done. Hannah Waddingham in charge of aircraft carrier was something that really paid off. I didn't like the \"lady boy\" person wearing that vest and donning horrible hairstyle in that submarine. Angela Bassett seemed a natural as a president and didn't feel forced to assume a masculine aura just because she's a female US President. Thanks to all the brilliant women in the movie to forsake that awful cliché line \"you don't think a woman can do it\" - you show them subtly rather than preaching non-stop about such superfluous substance like in some Marvel movie.Overall, a decent enough Mission: Impossible movie but a brilliant actioner, nonetheless, given how the series has always fared when compared by Hollywood's standards.

The Final Reckoning has its limitations and odd dramatic fixations, but it holds together as a massive cinematic experience filled with exhilarating, nail-biting, armrest-grabbing tension. Cementing its place as one of cinema's most consistent franchises, the film's breathtaking scale and death-defying stunts make for a blockbuster masterclass. Continuing Cruise and McQuarrie's intrepid crusade against the rising use of AI, it's hard not to enjoy the duo at home in their element, delivering yet more jaw-dropping stunts and globe-trotting adventure, overflowing with overly complex plot and escalating complication upon complication. In many ways, this is less an action film and more a disaster flick. Where worst-case scenarios were once implied, they are now visualised with apocalyptic projections. Gargantuan in action, runtime, and scope, The Final Recokoning completely embraces its grandiose nonsense. It acknowledges itself as huge, fun, silly, and emotionally rewarding, never attempting to restrain its exuberance, and we love it for that. A sentimental sendoff that accomplishes its mission with a characteristic flair for the impossible. Ethan can rest easy now. Mission accomplished Tom.",

            "review": "This is just a bad movie, and easily the worst of the franchise. I have no idea how it is being rated so highly on average.I kid you not, the first 60-90 minutes of this are mostly exposition dumps with minimal action. And the dialogue is so absurdly profound, I felt like any minute Leslie Nielsen would pop his head into the scene and say \"We're all counting on you\", like in Airplane. It baffles the mind how a movie this expensive to make, has so bad writing. That's when it's actually dialogue. More often than not it's a monologue about how the fate of the world hangs in the balance only Tom Cruise's character can save itAnd this is a theme throughout the whole movie. It is at great pains to remind us that only Tom Cruise's character can save the world. More than any previous Mission Impossible movie, this is unambiguously the Tom Cruise show. It feels like he is in every scene and they all revolve around how important he is. At one point, he actually gets told, and I quote verbatim: \"You Are The Chosen One\". Any other movie, that would have been the setup to a wisecrack, or the character being teased about it throughout the rest of the movie. In this one, it gets taken seriously! Mission Impossible used to be about the team coming together to enact a ludicrous plan to save the day. Not anymore. This movie elevates Ethan Hawke to godlike status with everybody else basically playing a glorified extra who should be thankful if they occasionally get shown on screen.But the biggest sin this movie commits, is that it's boring. These are meant to be fun action movies. But at a near three hour runtime, the action scenes are far and few in between. Most of the time the movie feels more interested in trying to get us to be sad that it's meant to be Tom Cruise's final Mission Impossible movie and forgets it's actually meant to be entertaining us.",

            "review": "This is easily one of the most anticipated films of the year-and for good reason. After nearly 30 years of explosive action, daring stunts, and intricate spy plots, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning may just be the final chapter in Ethan Hunt's legendary journey. And if it truly is the end, then what a powerful and heartfelt send-off it is.While it might not have the jaw-dropping, death-defying moment like the motorcycle jump off a cliff from Dead Reckoning Part 1-performed by Tom Cruise himself-The Final Reckoning delivers in other, equally meaningful ways. The story is packed with callbacks to previous Mission: Impossible films, cleverly weaving together a narrative that pays tribute to its roots. The return of William Donloe and flashes of Ethan from the early days (when Cruise was just 33) to now, at nearly 63, serve as a powerful reflection of time, dedication, and transformation.Amazingly, Tom Cruise still moves with the energy and intensity of someone half his age. His iconic sprint scenes are as thrilling as ever, and his commitment to physical performance continues to impress. Sure, the plot-like most spy thrillers-requires some suspension of disbelief. The odds are often impossibly small. But honestly? I didn't care. I was thoroughly entertained.Beyond the action, what stood out was the emotional depth. We see just how much Ethan cares for his team. The bond they share feels more like a family than a crew. The loss of Ilsa is heartbreaking, but it's handled with grace, and it adds real emotional weight. There are also moments of intelligent humor that bring lightness to the tension, making the 2-hour 49-minute runtime feel surprisingly brisk.The franchise began by staying close to its TV roots, where every member of the team had a special skill and no one outshined the others. At times, that format felt a little flat. But as the films evolved, so did the characters-and the emotional stakes. The introduction of Ethan's wife in Fallout added a new layer of humanity, and in this film, the emergence of new faces makes you wonder if a new team could one day carry on the legacy-even without Ethan.All in all, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is a phenomenal conclusion to one of the greatest action franchises of all time. It's thrilling, emotional, and packed with everything fans have come to love. If this really is the end, then they've ended it in the best possible way.",

And for me it does not work.Bringing back ground characters back from previous MI movies, who cares?! Tying the entity to what we saw in MI3. Why? We already had the setup in Dead Reckoning? Why make it any more complicated?!None of the epic / surprise set pieces such as the Kremlin bombing in Ghost Protocol are here. It very much needed something in the first 90 minutes, such as a nuke going off. Instead we are just told what the threat is and it goes on and on.No Masks, no Ethan completely surprisingly outsmarting the bad guy. It needed something epic, which I was expecting (Ethan had to outsmart the Entity and be a step ahead according to Luther!) For example Elsa could have surprisingly made it and just faked her death or so (in the party club scene in DR we saw Gabriel knives - I thought Ethan may have swapped them for dummy ones or so, the tools were there to do this).I'm not sure what they were thinking with this one.A real shame. Too much talk and hardly any fun.Worth seeing for the action.But stick to 4,5,6 and 7 for the best of the Mission movies. Those are funny, action packed and have much more heart.",

They just stretched the final action scene endlessly and the White House/ Pentagon scenes were too pompous and too long. One could have made the film so much better and more entertaining by cutting A LOT of scenes. However the movie was still fun, but by far not the best of the series.

It truly felt like nothing of substance took place to drive the plot forward for over an hour. Things just happened for the sake of happening. Characters came and went with sappy, unrealistic dialogue for the entire film. Ran to the bathroom? No worries, they'll recap what just happened and talk about what's coming three or four more times. Did you love the earlier Mission: Impossible movies? It's a good thing they'll be sprinkling in quick cuts of all of the best parts of them for almost 3 hours!Anticlimactic, an absolute bore, an a disappointment from start to finish.",

            "review": "There are some actors who do not just play a role. They live it. They breathe it. They are it. And Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt is exactly that. Watching The Final Reckoning feels like sitting in a dark room filled with decades of memories, missions, betrayals, and near-death experiences and quietly realizing it might be the last time we see this man sprint toward danger for our entertainment. If this really is the end, then what a journey it has been.This film is not just about espionage, global threats, or saving the world. At its very core, it is a cinematic love letter to Tom Cruise. From the very first shot, the camera practically worships him. And honestly, we do too. He is Mission: Impossible. It's almost as if the film pauses just long enough to let us appreciate the legacy he's built. The real bruises, the real fear in his eyes, the real wind slamming against his face thousands of feet in the air. When they say he does his own stunts, this movie is the ultimate proof of that.There's one sequence, a 20-minute spectacle involving planes, that had us gripping the edge of our seats. Not because it was over-the-top, but because it felt so damn real. The positioning of the cameras, the roaring sound of the engines, the barely visible tremble in Ethan's muscles. All of it screams authenticity. You could feel the gravity. You could feel the weight. And you could tell Cruise was putting every drop of himself into it. It is art through adrenaline.But The Final Reckoning is not perfect. And maybe it was never meant to be.This installment chooses not to waste time diving into backstories or emotional flashbacks. It is mission first, emotions later. And while that does keep the pace laser-focused for the most part, it also comes with a cost. Some fans may feel like the heart, the soul, the \"why should I care?\" moments, are few and far between. At times, it feels like the movie is sprinting only toward its mission goal that it forgets everything else.What we admire, though, is how The Final Reckoning ties itself beautifully to the past. It is not trying to create a brand new mission. It is not throwing a bunch of new characters into the mix. It is solving what Dead Reckoning left behind, and in doing so, it loops itself tightly around the other past six films. It closes loops. It answers questions. It brings emotional closure to threads that have been hanging for years. There's a certain bravery in doing that, of focusing on one mission and choosing not to open new doors just for the sake of future films.And then there's the villain. This antagonist is not just a bad guy, he is intangible. He is near God-like. The stakes are sky-high. It genuinely feels impossible. Like, actually impossible. It puts Ethan and his team in a corner where every second counts. Time is running out. Stake is at all-time high. It is everything we want in a Mission: Impossible film. It dares to make us believe the heroes may not win this time. That someone might not make it out alive.Here's where the main issue lies; this final installment felt very long-winded. It feels like it wants to tell you everything. It seems like it takes itself seriously... way too seriously even. It really does feel like it makes itself looks complex much more than what it is and what it's supposed to be.Some scenes also stretched out very long, like they wanted audience to listen to every word or watch at every action that took place. The pacing is very slow. One scene can go up to 7-8 minutes of what could have been cut to just about 3-4 minutes. It wants it to be very detailed but here's the thing. It's dour. It can be a bit dull. And because of that, some audience may lost interest in the movie. It gives you a lot of expositions that can feel too much for some especially if you're not that invested with the franchise or if you've forgotten a lot of details from the previous movies.There is also an underwater sequence teased in the trailers that promises something epic. And visually, it delivers. But emotionally and logically? It breaks the very rules this franchise has set up for years. This is the first time it felt like the story needed Cruise to have a bit of CGI help. A bit of plot armor. And that hurts. Because we know he is capable of doing the impossible. But here, it feels like the movie cheated its way to impress the audience. And that matters to us.And yes, the tone itself is gritty. It wants to be raw. It wants to be as realistic as it can. It wants the audience to immerse itself with Ethan Hunt to complete this final mission. Some may get into it. Some others may just feel tedious waiting for the next scene to happen. But here's one thing they forget; with all the grittiness that lies, it forgets to be entertaining for the mass market. The entertainment value in this is lacking for general audience. Everything that's entertaining with Fallout was almost devoid here. What made Fallout great was even with all the grittiness and the grainy tone, its entertainment value is top notch and high octane. It knows its target audience, it has the right balance of action, comedy, drama and romance. But The Final Reckoning forgets that part. Just serious faces doing serious things for almost 3 hours. The film forgets how to have fun. It forgets that people come to be thrilled and entertained. And that lack of balance makes the ride feel a little heavier than it should be.And finally, the ending. Is it satisfying? In some ways, yes. It gives us closure. It gives us enough to walk away with peace. But is it great? That's debatable. It could have used more 'heart'. It could have reached deeper. It ends with the feeling that maybe, just maybe, we're not actually done. That there might be more in the vault. And in today's Hollywood with reboots and sequels era, that's not hard to believe.Verdict: This one takes itself seriously. Way too seriously. It drowns in exposition, stretches scenes beyond their breaking point, and forgets that people came here to feel alive, not just overwhelmed. It forgets to breathe. It forgets to have fun. But maybe that's the point. The Final Reckoning is a heavy, brooding farewell that wants to honor Ethan Hunt and Tom Cruise with the gravitas of a cinematic eulogy. Because this feels like the last time we'll see him this raw, this real. His 20-minute plane sequence alone is worth the ticket. If this really is the end, The Final Reckoning isn't flawless but it is fearless. Thank you, Tom Cruise.",

            "review": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning attempts to blend high-octane action with modern anxieties about artificial intelligence, but the result is a hollow, bloated film that mistakes noise for substance and spectacle for storytelling.At its core, this is a movie that doesn't understand the subject it tries to tackle. The portrayal of AI is laughably vague and rooted in outdated clichés-clearly written by someone whose grasp of modern technology is, at best, superficial. It reduces complex systems to buzzwords and omnipotent digital forces that defy any kind of internal logic. The film treats AI as both all-powerful and conveniently fallible, depending entirely on what the script demands at any given moment.The action sequences-once the defining strength of the franchise-have become formulaic. Tom Cruise runs. Tom Cruise clings to moving vehicles. Tom Cruise survives the impossible. These moments, once exhilarating, now feel obligatory. Each set piece is dragged out far too long, escalating beyond reason until tension gives way to fatigue. The repetition dulls their impact, and without meaningful stakes, it's hard to care. The inevitability of the heroes' survival robs every confrontation of suspense.Worse, the film seems uninterested in narrative coherence or emotional depth. Character development is non-existent, and most interactions feel like placeholders between the next explosion or high-speed maneuver. The plot, thin and implausible, serves only as scaffolding for increasingly improbable action. There's no real arc-just a steady drumbeat of louder, faster, and more until the credits roll.Ultimately, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is a film trapped in its own delusions of grandeur. It clings to outdated storytelling methods, relying on spectacle to mask its lack of substance. It may satisfy those looking for three hours of escapism, but for anyone expecting a meaningful evolution of the franchise-or a competent exploration of contemporary themes-this movie offers little more than disappointment.",

However, not all are to my liking - the twist wasn't as impressive as previous movies and the plot felt a bit linear and thin. It's almost 3 hours so I feels like a road trip rather than a roller coaster. Despite this, I enjoyed the ride and it reminded me of what MI is really about: \"We live and die in the shadows, for those we hold close, and those we never meet.\"",

From the trailers and promotions, the movie sets high expectations of glamour, energy, and drama. Unfortunately, when the actual film unfolds, it quickly becomes clear that this is more style than substance, and watching it feels like a wasted investment of time.The biggest problem with Param Sundari lies in its writing. The story never really takes off; it meanders endlessly without a proper direction or emotional core. Instead of giving audiences a gripping narrative or memorable characters, the screenplay jumps from one unnecessary scene to another. This makes the film drag unnecessarily, testing the patience of viewers. Even the dramatic moments fail to strike a chord because the execution is shallow and predictable.The performances don't do much to salvage the experience either. Despite a talented cast, the characters lack depth and originality. Most of the actors appear to be going through the motions rather than breathing life into their roles. As a result, the audience struggles to connect with them on any meaningful level.Music and dance numbers, which could have been the saving grace, also turn out to be disappointing. Instead of enhancing the mood of the film, they feel inserted just for glamour and filler, leaving no lasting impression.Visually, the movie tries hard with costumes, sets, and camera work, but even that can't hide the lack of substance underneath.

Nothing-absolutely nothing-is funny in this unoriginal film. Everything-absolutely everything-seems forced and contrived and isn't authentic or at all believable. The cast is poorly chosen, in my opinion, and since \"series Simmons\" couldn't bring out the best in the two main protagonists, both shine with a somewhat cringeworthy overacting that actually does some justice to the very annoying and unsympathetic characters.Judging by the trailer, I was at least hoping the car chases might be good, but oh man, that backfired massively. The car chase scenes consist of a weird, perspective-based editing mess that leaves you completely disoriented. The camerawork lacks the skill to make the production's low budget look good and exciting. I also have no idea what's so interesting about the many close-ups of \"Samara Weaving\" and her frozen face. She plays her role so poorly throughout anyway that I would have loved to see a fly fly into her constantly half-open mouth; that would have been really funny.I can't say much about \"Karl Glusman,\" who is unknown to me and blessed with the charisma of a road worker and plays the ex-boyfriend, because he's so charismatically bland. The only bright spot is Andy Garcia, who solidly gets his paycheck here. Otherwise, the trivial, inconsequential dialogue is very fitting for the overall stereotypical characters portrayed in this run-of-the-mill heist drama.Conclusion:\nUnfunny, unoriginal, uninspired, inauthentic, half-baked, insignificant, unbearable.",

Her performance is superb and everything you would expect from a breakout role (think Eric Bana in Chopper, Margot Robbie in Wolf of Wall Street, Colin Farrell in Tigerland, Jeremy Renner in Hurt Locker) and oozes coolness on a level with Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction. She holds the movie together brilliantly with heart and logic while the madness unfolds around her, yet shows a genuine toughness missing from so many female characters written today - due to them simply being 'female versions' of the male characters that came before them (mainly aimed at superhero movies).This movie is well written, excellently directed and superbly acted by all involved. It's instantly rewatchable and will definitely go down as a cult classic if nothing else.There's no doubt we are in one of the worst periods of film history with the rubbish that's been churned out over the past five years, but i can honestly say i was entertained, amused, excited and impressed by everything and everyone involved in this film.

The script is overshadowed by very loud music in many scenes that is distracting, maybe on purpose, as if the writers didn't have enough confidence in the plot.

I also enjoyed the supporting cast with Karl Glusman, Steve Zahn, Andy Garcia, Randall Park, Marshawn Lynch, Mike O'Malley, Kyanna Simone, Jermaine Fowler and Chris Bauer. The plot of the movie is very simple and easy to follow, so I was invested in what was going to happen. You get some solid enough chase and action sequences throughout the movie that are well shot. And finally, the movie has a quick pace to keep the audience invested in the story.Negatives for Eenie Meanie (2025):\nThe movie's premise is one that I've seen many times in other movies and done much better. Aside from Samara Weaving, the supporting characters are whatever and I only remember them because of the actors playing them. There is nothing new here and it feels like the director watched a couple of movies with similar premises and decided to make the same movie. And finally, this movie was very clearly made by a first-time filmmaker as this is a movie that could've been made by literally anyone.Overall, Eenie Meanie (2025) is an okay and fun heist thriller movie with a fun cast and I am curious to see what the writer-director of this movie does next because this movie was literally a copy and paste of other movies that I've seen.

There are moments that try to capture the spirit of the original, some visual gags, a few quirky lines, and the familiar chaotic absurdity. But it just doesn't hit the mark.The original Naked Gun had something truly special: every single scene was packed with clever jokes, whether in the dialogue or hidden in the background. You could rewatch it multiple times and still catch new, subtle gags. That layered humor, the timing, the delivery, the straight-faced absurdity is what made it a classic.In this new version, it often feels like the filmmakers are trying too hard or relying too much on nostalgia, without fully understanding what made the original work. The pacing is slower, the humor is more forced, and at times it slips into just being silly rather than smartly absurd.It's not a bad film, but as someone who grew up laughing at every frame of the original, I can't help but feel this reboot lacks the sharpness, charm, and fearless stupidity that made Naked Gun legendary.Still I appreciate the effort.

There was probably about 7 times I got a chuckle, I enjoyed hearing the old music and such but, it just fell flat more me. The jokes were just not that funny, the plot was meh, and the acting just cannot compare to the original.Leslie Nielson and the original cast just nailed everything with ease and it was laugh out loud comedy.I left the theater unimpressed but, just my opinion on this.

Pamela Anderson is game and the scene with her singing is excellent, she looked great, too. Paul Walter Hauser has a scent role, but isn't really given much to do, whilst Danny Huston hams it up as the villain and it's always nice to see Kevin Durrand, even if he is under used. There is a surprise cameo which made me smile.I smiled a lot during this movie, it made me think of my Dad, who loved these movies. It is the most I have laughed in the cinema in a long time, but it's not up there with Tropic Thunder, Something About Mary, Four Weddings & A Funeral and The Birdcage, as my favourite comedies I've seen on the big screen!! Those had serious long belly laughs in the cinema, with everyone cracking up. There are not many better things than watching a hilarious movie, with a packed crowd.

The 90's pop culture references are forced and come off flat.The only decent thing about this film is Pamela Anderson. Otherwise, the rest of the cast have zero comedic chops, especially Neeson, who as I mentioned, is playing his Taken character 'trying to be funny,' but comes off angry, stiff, and dark.Avoid this film - film makers have no clue how to make funny films anymore.

The lore, the tone, even the personality of Sonja herself-none of it survives. It's as if the filmmakers skimmed a one-sentence Wikipedia summary and decided to \"make it their own,\" stripping out all the grit, charm, and spirit in the process.Abysmal acting by no-name actors: I'm all for giving new talent a chance, but these performances are painful. Every line sounds rehearsed but never felt. Emotional scenes land with a thud, and action moments feel like the actors are just waiting for someone to yell \"Cut!\" It's wooden, awkward, and sometimes unintentionally funny-but not in a good way.Non-existent budget: I swear the budget for this thing could have been covered by a month's rent in Los Angeles. The sets look like they were assembled in a community hall, with walls that practically wobble if anyone leans too hard. There's no sense of scale, no atmosphere-just cheap backdrops and bad lighting.Inaccurate costume design: Whoever handled costumes either didn't care or had no clue. Instead of the fierce, practical-yet-stylish fantasy gear you'd expect, we get outfits that look like bad cosplay rejects from a discount bin. They don't match the tone, the era, or the character at all.Poor fight choreography: The sword fights are slow, awkward, and so badly timed that it feels like watching kids play-fight in the backyard. Blows clearly miss, reactions are late, and the camera work tries (and fails) to make it look exciting. There's zero weight or danger to anything.Pathetic direction: This is the final nail in the coffin. The pacing lurches from painfully slow to rushed, scenes have no emotional payoff, and the overall tone is a mess. It feels like no one was steering the ship, just hoping it wouldn't sink before the credits rolled.By the time the film limped to its ending, I wasn't just disappointed-I was angry. *Red Sonja* deserved better.

She was attractive enough, but not the buxom beauty that made Red's enemies regularly underestimate her. Most importantly, she didn't have the athletic / muscular build that would be required for the part. The choreography was poor to start with, but her lack of power and stamina made it that much worse, as she either obviously pulled her punches or didn't have much punch to start with.Include in this repeated, repeated, repeated stabbing through plate armor and we have constant reminders of \"plastic\" Storm Trooper armor that wouldn't stop a stone shot from a slingshot. Pffft.Typical story, highly predictable. At least it had a semi-twist ending that redeemed it a little. (No spoilers.) Sadly, this is a typical sword-adventure film with an unfortunately unconvincing lightweight main character. Kudos to the actress. She just needed a bit more meat on her bones and (to be blunt) a bit more cleavage to convincingly play the part of Red Sonja. They might have looked at some of the Ladies of Wrestling to find the right build. It's not a \"guy review\" thing; it's a matter of accurate and believable character portrayal. I would describe this actress as more slim / petite than barbarian. She simply needed more \"body\".That said, I'll give kudos to the armor designer who eventually put her in something a little more stout than a barely-there chain mail bikini. A barbarian warrior with armor that at least covers her vital parts is far more sensible than the fan-service comic ever was.",

First, the obvious reason a beautiful sword-wielding woman would appeal to a teenage boy; second, for her unique back-story and impressive collection of personality disorders.I've long thought that Red Sonja deserved a film. She has, however, been short-changed in this area. To be sure, this effort is far superior to the abomination featuring Brigitte Neilsen and Arnold Schwarzenegger, but it still left much to be desired. Most importantly, they threw away almost all that is canon about Red Sonja - the traumatic experience in her youth, the intervention by her goddess, and her idiosyncratic oath/curse.Does this matter? Well, I think it does if you're going to call the film Red Sonja.Leaving that aside, this film is not without merit. Matilda Lutz has decent acting chops, and enough charisma to give the film a solid centre. Among the supporting cast, however, Wallis Day as Annistja (a character who does have personality disorders) steals every scene she's in, and would've made a better Sonja. So, possibly, would Danica Davis in the small role of Teresia.The film copes well with Sonja's famous outfit, there are a few laughs between the swordfights, and Robert Sheehan is just villainous enough as Draygen (who has a personality that would make Freud bite his pencil in two). The horse was good, as well. As for the actual plot - well, it was never going to be the most important part of the film (though, to be fair, it does pack one very good surprise).In sum: Is this a good adventure film?

Sadly it is not. The action is not even passable and chopped up into millions of cuts to hide how badly done it is.Not everything is horrible. The main actress is not bad. Lacking the charisma, beauty, and physique of Red Sonja she still manage to put in a good performance believable enough. The basic story is okay and close enough to the comic to be passable. Sonja also get her red hair and bikini-like armour (slightly more covering her body) in a natural video-game sort of a way which make sense. There are also a couple of scenes and events which elevate the movie somewhat.I was almost entertained and could almost emerge myself into this world.

Matilda Lutz was awesome as Red Sonja and while that isn't a high bar, she is the best version oft his character that I've seen so far. I really enjoyed the supporting cast who join Red Sonja on her revenge mission and they got in the action as well. The villains are entertaining cartoons which should sound bad, but the actors playing them knew what they were doing and I loved it. M. J. Bassett did an excellent job with the action sequences and there was a lot of blood that made me very happy. There is a good mix of practical and digital effects that was done perfectly. And finally, I liked the pacing as everything had a nice flow to the story and it never overstayed its welcome.Negatives for Red Sonja (2025):\nMy only issue is that I wasn't a fan of how the villains were defeated and I do believe that M.

I think most distributors passed on the film because it is pure garbage, easily one of the most moronic Troma films I have ever seen, and that's saying something.I gave it a shot because I found the original The Toxic Avenger to be fairly fun, was intrigued by the impressive cast (Peter Dinklage as Winston AKA Toxie, Kevin Bacon as the villain, Bob Garbinger, and Elijah Wood as Bob's brother Fritz), I thought that the trailer looked promising (hinting at plenty of over-the-top gore), and I thoroughly enjoyed director Macon Blair's I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore. Unfortunately, nothing about this film works. Blair attempts to replicate Lloyd Kaufman's trademark lunacy, with plenty of colourful characters and general craziness, but it all feels so desperate: the gags fall flat and the chaotic direction is loud and obnoxious. The splatter is okay, but nowhere near as excessive as the trailer suggests (and too reliant on CGI).I tried very hard to get into the swing of things - even forced myself to smirk a couple of times - but if truth be told, it wasn't long before I was praying for the film to end.

Its also bloody HILARIOUS at times. There's more than one laugh out loud moment, and, one moment in particual is the funniest thing I've seen in the cinema this year (let me know in the comments which bit you think I'm talking aboutIts ultra violent (the word UNCUT was literally in the title card)There's location text on screen like 'yonder spooky woods' and things like that, wo yeah, very much tongue in cheek and fun in that senseI don't have the affinity to the original that many people do, I've seen the original but It wasn't a staple of my childhood or anything so I've not overwhelming connection to it,So I'm ok with the story changes, with the fact they've rebooted and remade it.Its not Dinklage in the Toxie suit, its Luisa Guerreiro. While she does a great job with the physicality of the role, the reality is all of Dinklage's lines were dubbed in after the fact, and it shows on more than one occasion, when that happens, it takes you out of the movie a little. It does feel like theres a disconnect between the physical role and the voice.I saw it at 9am at a press screening at the Edinburgh Film Festival, so not quite the time or the crowd to fully embrace it. Speaking of embracing it,,,, why don't you go ahead and ... ahem... EMBRACE that SUBSCRIBE button.....THANK YOUIt was then shown to the public at midnight as part of the 'Midnight Madness' line up, I image the atmosphere at that screening was a little more.... lively.--\nOn that not, my good friend Cinephile Mike was at both the 9am press screening AND the midnight madness screening, so I'm gonna pass you over to him for a brief moment as he tells what that was like, take it away Mike\n--6/10 for the Toxic Avenger, totally bonkers, ultra violent at times, very much tongue in cheek if a little unsure of itself tonally at times.There IS an end credits scene so be sure toi stick around for that, and If you wanna see my thoughts on other films from the Edinburgh film festival, you can click here.",

A band of musician assassins - think Insane Clown Posse / Slipknot - provide slapstick, and a subplot involving the primary villain being in hock to worse villains was entertaining.No real attempt at moral nuance or intellectual rigour - I loved the doctor explaining the technical stuff - but great fun and well worth the time and ticket money.",

The storyline follows a widowed single dad raising his stepson who learns from his doctor that he has only six months to a year to live. Desperate for help, he turns to the owner of his company for treatment but is rejected, setting him on a path of revenge, transformation, and vengeance.This film is directed by Macon Blair (I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore) and stars Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones), Kevin Bacon (Friday the 13th), Elijah Wood (The Lord of the Rings), Taylour Paige (Zola), and Jacob Tremblay (Doctor Sleep).This movie gave me exactly what I wanted. It has the perfect blend of Hobo with a Shotgun and Class of Nuke 'Em High. I was glad it wasn't a straight remake but instead took the story in a fresh new direction. The characters, setting, and premise pull you right into its universe, delivering that gritty mix of grindhouse, horror, comedy, and sci-fi that you expect from a Toxic Avenger / Troma Entertainment production.The acting hits the right notes, the storyline has more depth than expected, and the villains are perfectly over the top. The special effects shine with a great mix of practical work and CGI-the opening \"arm\" sequence, the Miss Meat Dinner scene, every battle with \"Killer Nuts,\" and the climactic showdown gave me everything I was hoping for. I also loved the opening narration, the animation, and of course, the soundtrack.If I had any complaints, I would have liked more from the transformation scene, and while some of the CGI was excellent, other moments felt uneven. Still, overall this film delivered exactly what I was looking for...and stay for the after credits.In conclusion, The Toxic Avenger is far better than it has any right to be-a fun, modern reimagining of a cult classic. I'd score it a solid 7.5/10.",

            "review": "After two long years of waiting, The Toxic Avenger has finally splattered its way onto the big screen and believe me, this delay had nothing to do with quality. Much like this summer's The Naked Gun revival, Macon Blair's reboot of the cult classic knows exactly what it is and leans into it unapologetically. The result? A crude, raunchy, blood-soaked horror-comedy that never once apologizes for its absurdity and delivers the splatterfest fans have been craving.This fifth installment in the franchise-and a reimagining of the 1984 Troma classic-is every bit as outrageous as its predecessors but with a modern twist that blends old-school grindhouse charm with slick, updated filmmaking. There are tits, dicks, off-color jokes, and buckets of gore flying across the screen exactly what you'd expect from a Toxic Avenger movie, and then some. If you grew up on Lloyd Kaufman's wild, politically incorrect originals, you'll feel right at home. If you're new to Tromaville and more accustomed to the squeaky-clean tone of modern superhero flicks, buckle up. This one will either shock you or convert you.Peter Dinklage absolutely owns the role of Toxie. He brings heart, grit, and just the right amount of tragic hero energy to a character that could have easily slipped into pure parody. His journey taking on the evil BTH corporation, led by Kevin Bacon's vile Bob Garbinger. Bacon, for his part, is clearly having a blast as the sleaziest CEO imaginable, chewing up every scene with cartoonish villainy.The balance of practical effects and CGI is one of the movie's strongest points. The gore here is gloriously over the top but still tactile enough to keep that Troma DNA alive. Limbs fly, heads explode, and the screen is painted red in set pieces that rival some of the best splatter moments of the past decade. But what makes it work is that, underneath the carnage, there's still a story with heart, a hero who, despite his grotesque transformation, just wants to do the right thing.The humor is as sharp and unapologetic as ever. Blair doesn't try to sanitize the material to make it \"palatable\" for modern audiences. Instead, he embraces the outrageousness of the original films and turns it up a notch, creating a film that is self-aware without ever becoming self parody.The Toxic Avenger is a filthy, funny, and fantastically bloody good time. It's rare for a reboot to honor its source material while carving out its own identity, but Macon Blair and Peter Dinklage pull it off. Whether you're a lifelong fan of Toxie or a newcomer looking for something bold, brash, and completely insane, this one is not to be missed.",

I just saw it a few hours ago and I've gotta say that it's just barely above average. The biggest problem with this movie is that a huge majority of the jokes in this movie fall flat and leave an awkward impression. It also didn't help that the tone and pacing for this movie was an absolute mess as well.That being said, I was never bored or put off by the film. There's an amazing display of gore (even if it's hugely CGI) and sight gags as well.

When it works, it's gold; when it doesn't, it drags the film down.Unfortunately, the second half loses steam with corny pacing and heavy-handed messaging that comes off preachy. The satanic, horned villain and his wife push the grotesque imagery too far, pulling you out of the fun as if the filmmakers got lost in their own weirdness.Dinklage's performance and a few comedic gems keep it from total collapse, but the sluggish pacing, inconsistent humor, and preachy undertones sink what could have been a wild ride.",

It updates the titular character for modern times effectively and is always moving quickly enough to remain a fun watch. The bad taste sensibilities are more than accounted for and it also has the required heart to be emotionally investing as well.Peter Dinklage gets things off to a strong start thanks to his heartfelt performance as a downbeat guy who just wants to be a good dad. Once he hands over the physical work to Luisa Guerreiro, they work well together so it still feels like one character. Kevin Bacon is the fun kind of pathetic villain and Elijah Wood similarly gets some laughs out of his eccentric character. Taylour Paige does the narrative heavy lifting as well as delivering solid jokes.Macon Blair's direction has a clear affection for this genre and when the smaller budget becomes visible it only adds to the charm. All the gore is fittingly bloody and gleefully over the top but it would've benefited from looking more practical overall. The occasionally snappy editing by Brett W. Bachman and James Thomas prevents the film from getting bogged down by the most common narrative tropes when they appear.",

To her surprise Valeria is engaged to marry a Frenchman named Manu and the two have not only spent Valeria's inheritance, but they want Lili to agree to sell their mother's property on the island and they just conveniently have a real estate agent who already has a buyer lined up.Meanwhile Lili meets Tom, a fellow German and bar manager. The two have instant chemistry...but the next day we discover there may be a more sinister story as the real estate agent approaches Tom about doing a job.I feel like the film is more of a story about an elaborate con than an actual thriller...but maybe I have been spoiled by some really good Nordic noirs that have set my bar pretty high for thriller (which just happens to be my favorite genre).I loved the setting, which was gorgeous. I thought the two leads were not only gorgeous but had smoking chemistry. I was a little creeped out about by Girasol and her bevy of young male seducers. Not really a crime where I am from, I think because most men on my island would be ashamed to take advantage of a woman in such a way.It's the height of summer and I could feel the heat in this film making it a summer recommendation from me.

Characters exchange dialogue that feels less like a conversation and more like a series of non-sequiturs, each line a solitary island in an ocean of awkward silence. Talented actors, particularly the excellent Svenja Jung, do their best to inject some semblance of emotion into this narrative abyss, but it's like asking a concert pianist to perform a masterpiece on a broken kazoo. You can see the effort, but the result is a dissonant, painful mess. The titular \"thrills\" are non-existent, unless you count the heart-pounding tension of watching two people look at each other with vaguely troubled expressions for extended periods.This cinematic shipwreck is a stunning feast for the eyes. The film's DOP deserves a medal, or at least a better script. Every frame of Mallorca is a joy to watch. The golden-hour light bathing ancient stone villas, the impossibly blue waters of the Mediterranean, the serpentine roads carving through lush green hills-it's all a breathtaking advertisement for Spanish tourism.In the end, Fall for Me is a rare and peculiar beast. It is a film that is profoundly bad in almost every technical and creative way. It's the cinematic equivalent of a luxury car with no engine: it looks magnificent on the outside, but it won't take you anywhere you want to go.

Sandler eases back into Happy like it's 1996, and familiar faces are everywhere.But suddenly, things take a wild turn, and we are stuck in a bonkers sequel with no semblance of reality or cohesion. It is so bonkers that much of the last hour is indescribable.Essentially Happy needs to raise money again to send his daughter to ballet school. He has to return to golf, which is being hijacked by a gingivitis addled fruit loop with grand plans to turn golf into MTV x XFL.I didn't expect much, but was pleasantly surprised early on, particularly with Happy's hilarious buffoon sons. Unfortunately, we are left with another Zoolander 2 style debacle. 5/10.",

It had me constantly checking how much time was remaining.Which is my first critique: coming in six minutes under two hours, the film is 30 minutes too long and you can feel the bloat.Second: the cameos and flashbacks are gratuitous. Nearly every character feels like a cameo. And the flashbacks feel insulting as if the film makers don't trust the audience to remember one of the most memorable comedies of the 90s.And then the production value is just underwhelming. Some of it feels like it's for comedic effect, sure. But other times it's just bad. The cgi feels cheap, rushed, and unnecessary. You can also occasionally see where the green screen / digital backgrounds meet the physical set - particularly in the last act. It looks as if they're filming in a curved space - which they probably are.And the jokes and writing are just poor. So much of it is forced or nostalgia. None of it feels organic. The whole vibe feels off.There's just not much good here at all. It's unfortunate given how classic the original has become.",

Did they see the first movie? Bizarre moments, crude humor and goofy cameos were staples of the original and were of course represented in abundance here.As for the cameos, it's not just incredible the people that Sandler can get to be in his movies, but the things he gets those people to say and do are amazing. From a cameo perspective this is possibly his greatest achievement yet! They were many, and they were awesome.Also I guarantee that the current generation of pro golfers in this movie all grew up watching Happy Gilmore. How exciting was it for them to be in this?

I don't think I laughed once.Lots of the jokes are just lame rehashes of the actual funny jokes in the original, or just corny and not funny. Awful \"that's what she said\" jokes in 2025? Movie relies too heavily on nostalgia and has constant cutaways to the original movie, which just made me wish I was watching the original instead.I know plot is not as important for a comedy, but man did I not like where the story went that much at all. I didn't like it went for Extreme golf, rather just stick to normal golf. But overall, the plot is still just mostly a cheap rehash of the original, but would be fine if the movie was actually funny, but it isn't. And the main driving force of the movie is super weak. He has to get huge money to send his daughter to a ballet school in Paris, problem is the daughter is boring and has no real personality so I don't really care if Happy accomplishes his goal or not. Unlike the OG, where the Goal was to make big money to get his Grandma's house back, and I cared WAY MORE about Happy's goal cuz they show a ton of times how much a sweetheart his Grandma is and how much she grounds Happy's character. So it makes you really want Happy to win! At one point his Grandma even says, \"it's okay, it's just a house, I just want you to be happy.\"I struggled so hard to finish this movie, it's 2 hours, which is extremely long from a comedy, and you really feel that length since it's not funny at all. It really made me just want to rewatch the OG again for the millionth time and pretend this sequel never happened.I think Adam Sandler just lost his comedy charm and energy. I don't blame him, he's just really old now. Click IMO was his last great comedy. Ever since, his schtick just grown more tired. This is probably Adam Sandler at his worst in a comedy movie. Even Jack and Jill while god awful, was kinda so bad it's good with some genuinely funny moments still, and Al Pacino wasn't half bad in it. I know it sounds crazy, but I would actually rather rewatch Jack and Jill than Happy Gilmore 2. Happy Gilmore 2 is just boring. It doesn't have the classic goofy vibe of his classic that you want to rewatch over and over and show your friends, ie Happy Gilmore OG of course, Billy Madison, Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates, Longest Yard, which IMO are the top 5 Comedy Adam Sandler movies.I know this may seem harsh, but he should just retire from comedy.

Some would even say the conjuring is one of the top horror films of all time. WAN found his niche within his created conjuring universe with the likes of these films, insidious, and all of the other spin offs. With this has come quite a few more filler movies from other directors that are much less experienced aside from (Whannell) at the helm. Michael Chaves is not a bad director by any means, but this simply does not hold a candle to the first two films or even the last one which was actually decently solid. This one just feels like the most uninteresting of the four and while it has a few decent demonic scares and visuals, it simply does not serve that much of a purpose other than a supposed ending. I actually do not think this will be truly the last of the conjuring films either, though I think it should've ended after the last one. I can think of at least three other films within the universe that aren't even great by any means, but are still more interesting than this. Annabelle Creation, The Nun, and even insidious 4 are all more effective . That's not to say this doesn't have a few redeeming qualities if you're a fan, but if it really was the end, Wan should've ended the Warren's story ...",

As it wraps up the main saga, the film delivers a powerful and satisfying conclusion that ties together long-standing storylines and character arcs, leaving audiences both fulfilled and eager for what may lie ahead.For horror enthusiasts, this film is a must-watch-a cinematic experience best enjoyed in IMAX where the grandeur and intensity of the visuals and sound can truly be appreciated.

Characters exist just to be spooked, and the scares are predictable jump-outs you can see a mile away. There's no tension, no atmosphere, just loud bangs and cheap tricks. At this point, you can practically set a stopwatch to when the next door will slam.And then there's Michael Chaves. Let's be real-this isn't his first stumble. La Llorona was weak. The Devil Made Me Do It barely felt like a horror movie. The Nun II was a snooze. And now here we are again, same bag of empty tricks. He confuses loud noises for scares and speed bumps for suspense. If James Wan built this house of horror with care, Chaves has turned it into a carnival ride running out of batteries.Who in their right mind thought that hey let's give the guy who delivered 3 trashes in a row another story to butcher? Perfect for a franchise closer.Sure, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga do their best, as always. Their chemistry still works, but they can't carry a whole movie on their backs.

Well that's very much the case with Ed and Lorraine Warren in this latest addition to The Conjuring franchise.What I initially assumed would be a fresh investigation sadly turns out to be more of the same formula we've seen over the past 10 years. There's little here that feels original; most of it either borrows heavily from previous entries or is clearly influenced by familiar tropes. A door left slightly open for the audience to notice... SLAM. A recording or photo reveals a ghostly figure. A quick camera cut - and boom, you're face-to-face with a demon.My biggest issue with the film is that it simply cannot stand on its own. It leans too heavily on paranormal figures the Warrens have battled before. Yes, there are creepy moments, the buildup often leads to little more than cheap jump scares.For a film with a runtime of 2 hours and 15 minutes - and a cast of 13 people and one dog - it plays things very safe. Sure there is suspense but, where is the danger? Who is the actual target? These are questions I found myself asking throughout the film.

It does stand apart, though, by leaning more heavily into story & character development than pure horror. I know many viewers will actually appreciate that approach, but for me, it came with a trade-off: because so much time was dedicated to the narrative, the multiple entities involved in the haunting didn't get as much screen time or presence as they could have. A tighter balance (slightly less story, more entity-driven horror) would've made it even stronger.That said, what's here is still excellent. The storytelling, while heavier, is well done & the film delivers some truly unique scare moments from the demons. It's a different flavour from earlier Conjuring entries, but it still holds that trademark mix of tension, atmosphere & supernatural dread.Overall, it's another very good addition to the franchise.

When you look at a film like The Exorcist from 1973, it roughly cuts fast, it is very slow paced for today's standards, the camera holds itself long, not many effects or anything, the whole horror is made by build-up and performances... it's the simple things. Lightning and Sound-Design are top tier and makes you feel unease. Here, we have so much of it, and it still feels flat. Why? Because they don't know how to CREATE and USE tension. It is a tool to boost emotional development of the characters. It is also a tool to increase our feeling of unease for example. And to anyone who says, The Exorcist was the first film and is hella old, they can't just redo that all the time, you don't get the point.Veronica, a Spanish horror film, made in I believe 2013, falls into this category of great reality-inspired horror. It is terrifying because it doesn't hold or loses its tension, it does neither of that. It just FLYS by, and what we care for, is her psychological well-being and the survival of his brother. We gotta care, and know that THESE characters aren't safe, these films don't play anymore with psychological fears of the human mind that are deeply rooted in our nature. Recently I watched and film from France, Spoorlos, or The Vanishing. Without context, there's a scene where a character lies in an tomb alive. That was scary and made me feel uneasy, it made me sick for minutes. Same with claustrophobic environments, they just want to scare us with LOUDNESS and unexpected things. And that is the main problem.There are a few scenes where that feeling gets transported, for example when someone looks around and see's a demon in silent darkness, or when someone suddenly starts to throw up glass and blood, these scenes are great, especially the second one catched me, but that is made by the performances of her and everyone standing beside her.Conjuring's Final isn't bad by any means, but It is so exaggerated in its simplicity of that makes sense. It's not bigger, it's not more intense, it's just overly-more exaggerated in the way it pays-off its scenario. The actual characters, especially the Main Cast, they deliver well and the chemistry of Lorraine and Ed is again what makes this film halfway good. I just think they're chemistry and love is perfect and felt through every scene of these films, especially in this one.I enjoy it for what It is, but looking back, the first Conjuring was something that still gave you shivers weeks after watching only by thinking about it...",

I gotta say I was nervous going in about this because it being the final chapter for the Conjuring films, not spin offs. Michael Chaves has evolved as a filmmaker ever since La Llorona. I didn't hate any of the Conjuring Films we all know some aren't the best. However every film of this franchise I own and do watch a lot because they're effective! NOW with this being Michaels 4th film directed in the franchise, it clearly shows he gets better with each of his work. The Conjuring Last Rites for myself and my father felt like a true conjuring film. It took its time to know the characters, it had such heart with both the warrens and the Smurl family despite the hell they're going through. Patrick and Vera are just a true force and always makes us feel hopeful and how we all admire their dedication to any extent to save others and also worrying about losing those you love. The focusing on the family dynamic of the warrens and their daughter Judy was a really beautiful touch. The scares in this final chapter were honestly some of the best of the franchise. We both left the theatre all after the total end credits and post credits... for a reason. I highly recommend this to any horror fan or Conjuring Universe lover.

And, regrettably, that's the problem that plagues the second solo narrative feature outing from writer-director Ethan Coen. This pulpy comedy-drama-crime thriller, which follows the exploits of flamboyant, perpetually \"thirsty\" small town private detective Honey O'Donahue (Margaret Qualley) in her investigation of a series of unsolved murders apparently tied to mysterious church, successfully incorporates an array of truly captivating qualities - colorful character development, fine performances (particularly by Qualley and in the supporting portrayals of Aubrey Plaza, Chris Evans and Charlie Day), a well-crafted production design and a collection of knock-it-out-of-the-park one-liners. In fact, about the only thing that's missing here is a solid, comprehensible story. The picture's disjointed jumble of plot threads - many of them underdeveloped and/or extraneous - meanders along for roughly 90 minutes without ever really going anywhere or saying anything relevant or meaningful. To be sure, \"Honey Don't!\" has its share of genuinely enjoyable moments, but a handful of modestly memorable instances does not a movie make. And that's unfortunate, given that it seems the picture has many of the ingredients for what could have potentially been an outlandishly funny, wickedly engaging tale. Instead, viewers are left with a plot that aimlessly roams from tangent to tangent and never seems to coalesce into something substantial or integrated, no matter how visually appealing it might be or how effective it is in tickling one's funny bone. And, when the film comes up lacking in this regard, it often falls back on titillating sequences driven by graphic sexuality or edgy violence to shore up its obvious deficiencies, a rather cheap and cheesy way to try and revive sagging audience interest. In that sense, then, this production reminds me very much of the films of such directors as Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson, whose releases, in my view, are often long on style and woefully short on substance. I find all of this rather disappointing, especially in light of Coen's filmography over the years, particularly his many successful productions with his brother Joel. But perhaps that's the key ingredient that's missing here - the collaboration of the two siblings working together to produce truly outstanding works of cinema (and, thankfully, a reunion of the two is said to be in development). Whatever the case, though, it appears the filmmaker's sophomore attempt at working on his own has not yet yielded cinema of the caliber that he's capable of. Let's hope that changes with his next project.",

It felt like the film was trying to say something profound, but the tone was so off that it missed its mark entirely.I truly don't know what audience they were aiming for. Too heavy-handed to be light drama, too scattered to be meaningful, and too dull to be entertaining. Characters drifted through scenes without much purpose, and while the story had the bones of something emotional, it never built to anything worth caring about.The pacing didn't help either. There were long stretches where I caught myself checking the time, waiting for something-anything-to happen. Instead, it kept circling back to the same dreary mood that never paid off.In the end, I can see why the studio released this movie in the dead zone of late August, right before Labor Day weekend. It feels like one of those \"let's just get it out there and move on\" kind of releases.

The usual dark humour is sorely lacking, the dialogue isn't as sharp, the script is a mess and the final pay-off is a major letdown.Indeed, only Qualley and Aubrey Plaza come out of the overly woke sexually charged Coen-carnage with any performance credibility, while a miscast Chris Evans and the rest of the supporting cast are as hollow and throwaway as the lacklustre screenplay.In truth, it's been far too long since either of the brothers have hit a 'HoF' homerun (No Country for Old Men in 2007!), and this is yet another strikeout for the undenable Hollywood legends who hardly put a foot wrong between 1984-2001!

This was a movie I was excited for since I'm a massive fan of the Coen Brothers, but it is sad for me to say this movie was just okay.Positives for Honey Don't (2025):\nThe movie does have an interesting premise of this young private investigator searching for the killer while also having to deal with a detective who refuses to believe that she is a lesbian. Margaret Qualley does a great job as Honey O'Donahue and she is one of the reason to watch this movie. I did enjoy the the supporting cast with Aubrey Plaza, Chris Evans, Charlie Day, Kristen Connolly, Billy Eichner, Gabby Beans and Talia Ryder. The main murder mystery is interesting at first with its ties to this church headed by Chris Evans. You still get that Coen western vibe that Ethan and his brother Joel have done very well together. And finally, there are some good action sequences that are decently bloody and I liked it.Negatives for Honey Don't (2025):\nThis movie barely has a story to tell to its audience. The movie feels like a series of events happening in order, but none of it lands right. The movie is too short to tell a story and it felt like Ethan Coen just wanted to make a lesbian movie without the story. And finally, Charlie Day got on my nerves as he refuses to accept that Margaret Qualley is a lesbian and I wanted to knock him out.Overall, Honey Don't is a serviceable enough detective movie with a great cast, but it falls short of what Ethan Coen is known for doing when he is at his best.",

Honey's world includes her sister, Heidi (Kristen Connolly), her niece, Corrine (Talia Ryder), police detective Metakawich (Charlie Day), police officer MG Falcone (Aubrey Plaza), and Rev. Drew (Chris Evans), leader of the Four-Way Temple.\"Honey Don't\" includes many Ethan Coen earmarks--all the characters are eccentric, the setting is deliberately confusing with 1940s imagery mixed with 2024 imagery, and the plot jerks the viewer around multiple times. Thus, it's a fun watch for Coen fans, but it feels like the film wasn't fully baked. There are way too many loose ends, and it doesn't feel like a coherent whole at the end.

Margaret Qualley and Aubrey Plaza were fantastic (as were ALL the supporting characters). If one were to watch without knowledge of how film noir works, they may have thought that their characters were stoic and straightforward...but that's the point! They perfected an ART that has been lost. And if you don't believe me, just watch any Humphrey Bogart film, or something in a similar time period and prove me otherwise. And maybe people aren't used to a female playing a morally ambiguous character like that of a cold, matter-of-fact detective. That role was SUPPOSED to have a poker face and a tone with rare inflection. AND THEY DID! Perfectly. It was pure cinematic genius. It's called \"hardboiled detective fiction\" and they nailed it. I mean, if you've ever seen either of them in various roles you would know that this was out of the norm for their roles and likely not easy.The cheesy stereotypes, like the cheesy one-liner piano player and the creepy old dad were set off to highlight the main characters and perhaps why they are cold. That's intentional, and incredible.I don't want to give too much away, but this film is brilliant. The set decoration and secondary characters SCREAM Antelope Valley and Bakersfield area.

This and Drive-Away Dolls and, if it happens, the third movie in this unofficial Shaggy Lesbian-and-Liquor-and-Cigarette Soaked Neo-Noir trilogy are \"B\" level in what is on the page, and if it feels minor it is mostly because of the insanely high quality of work that Coen has in his Hard-Left-Turn Crime movies (and Cooke as well as co-editor on several films by the brothers).Thankfully, the filmmakers know how sharp Qualley looks in those heels and suits and understand what power she has as a beauty on screen but more importantly how adept she is at the Coen style of snappy patter that often moves into more serious connotations in the next scene or within the scene (the moment when her father comes a knocking straddles the line between funny and sad and is a perfect example of the amusing melancholy that laces many parts of the second half of this at least).There are also plum parts for a crude Chris Evans, nearly half of his performance half naked - he seems the most to me, for better or worse, like a character that could easily be in a Coen homage or even rip off (tell me he is not a spot on recurring character for the Fargo TV show) - and Aubrey Plaza, who gets to have such a wild monologue late in the film that it makes the turn into this moment justified (though barely, I'm still not sure how I feel about that without giving too much except that it does give a beat for a kind of critique of internalized misogyny maybe the film needed more time to unpack).Meanwhile, there is some terrific sensuality as well as absurd moments with that (easy pickings for comedy, sure, but still funny), and some horrific violence that shows that this late-era filmmaker can find new ways to make an audience curdle a bit from common household items in panic mode. I also liked the ways that just by flipping gender a bit we see certain tropes in a familiar but skewed light like with Billy Eighner's few scenes (the kind of actor who makes a full meal out of a school lunch worth of characterization). Again, I can't go to bat for this as something greater than what it is, and yet I think it is only trying to be as clever as it is and not much more.

            "review": "I just got back from seeing it at the theatersThe movie, overall, matches the original, which is a big accomplishment for a sequel: the original will always have the distinction of being the first, and with this particular premise, a huge hindrance is that he can't really be a Nobody twice. Part 1 could build up the moment where the audience and supporting characters find out who he is, but the franchise can't replicate that plot device in sequels. By Part 2, he's a Somebody.Still, though, the movie surpasses the original in 2 areas. Firstly, I think that the comedy in Part 2 surpasses the comedy in Part 1. There were numerous instances in Part 2 that legitimately had me laughing, and I'm not easy to please on comedy (e.g. I found the 2025 Naked Gun movie to be unfunny). To say what parts had me laughing might ruin those parts, so I won't say. Secondly, I think that Sharon Stone makes a better, more memorable antagonist than the Russian guy in Part 1.The movie's other positives are basically the same positives that apply to Part 1. Bob Odenkirk is a likable and charming protagonist. Though his role as Saul Goodman is iconic, you don't actually see Saul Goodman when you watch him in this movie; he occupies this role entirely. The movie blends the slick, intense action scenes with hilarious comedy in a way that neither clashes with the other or creates awkwardness. The compact 90-minute runtime is perfect. And I like Christopher Lloyd. We don't know how many more big-screen movies he'll appear in, so we should cherish themIn terms of flaws - the movie has a predictable plot; nothing here is really original or creative. And I don't imagine that many people, after watching, will remember this movie in the long-run. The movie builds up Sharon Stone's character, yet the protagonists take her out relatively easily. There are some cliches. There are some elements recycled from the first filmI gave the original a 6.5/10. I'll give this one the same score6.5/10.",

The family were great and Connie Neilson gets more to do. Fight scenes original and funny. Sharon stone and tom hanks son delightfully over acting, which reminds us it does not take itself too seriously. I smiled and laughed throughout.

Every scene is so predictable you can call it before it happens... and you'll always be right.If you want over-the-top, logic-free action, there are countless better options in the genre.

I was super excited for this film and although I don't think it's better than the first film I think it's still a great time but there's some things which I didn't think worked too well compared to the first film. Let me get my positives out the way I think Bob Odenkirk is fantastic as always and does another great performance playing Hutch and I love the direction this character is taking with a possible franchise happening ever. I also really enjoyed the family dynamic of the movie and how the family elements also play a big role in this movie like the first film as well and I really enjoy these moments. The action was also fantastic and there's some awesome action moments throughout the movie and this movie has some awesome choreography with some of the action scenes here in this film. I also think most of this movie has some great moments throughout its runtime and there's some good emotional moments as well. I think what makes this film lackluster a little is how many characters the movie tries to balance and we don't really get to see most of these characters do much and the movie just throws them to the side for majority of the film which isn't fun unfortunately as I wanted to see more character storylines in this. I also think the story is all over the place as well and there's some moments which make the movie feel a little dumb at times which I know this movie isn't doing anything too serious but there's some dumb plot lines in the movie. I also feel like this movie should've been longer as well as this movie literally flies by and just glances over some things which I wish they would've touched on more throughout the story and the writing is a little funky sometimes as well. Although there's some good comedy inserted throughout the movie which I found to help the movie just like how it helped out the first movie. This is still definitely a fun movie worth checking out in theaters and I would still recommend it for sure!",

            "review": "Nobody 2 is the sequel to the first Nobody film from 2021. This sequel is directed by Timo Tjahjanto, known for The Night Comes for Us.Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) is still working as a hitman, a job that seems to have only gotten busier since his confrontation with the Russian mafia. When Hutch notices that the rest of his family could also use some relaxation, he decides to take them on a holiday to a vacation park he used to visit as a child.When Hutch and his family run into trouble there, he discovers that the park is run by corrupt criminals led by mafia boss Lendina (Sharon Stone). She sends her best people after Hutch and his family, unaware that Hutch himself has connections in the criminal underworld and even works for them.The first Nobody film was an entertaining action flick, essentially a standard action movie in the style of the John Wick films, but with Bob Odenkirk's own action style, which gave the film something unique. With this sequel, they attempt to mimic more of the atmosphere and action style of 1980s action movies. They succeed fairly well, which makes the film extra fun for fans of that kind of older action cinema.The action scenes, however, are often filmed with too much movement or zoomed in too closely, so you can't always clearly see what's happening. Sometimes you're asked to more or less fill in yourself how Hutch takes out his enemies, though you are given enough beforehand to guide you in a certain direction. This makes it seem like they played it a bit safer with the action this time around. The explosions also don't always come across as convincing. Despite these less clear and safer moments, it remains an enjoyable action movie.The story also stays on the safe side, meaning you can often predict what will happen and where the plot and action will ultimately lead. While Bob Odenkirk's character received help from his family in the first film, in part two this family assistance seems to have been expanded. As a result, the film can sometimes lose some of its focus. In addition to following Hutch, his wife and children also get extended screen time, but they don't always do anything important, which sometimes slows the pace.Bob Odenkirk still convincingly plays a hitman who takes out his enemies with his own style. This time, however, he sometimes has to unnecessarily share his screen time with the actors playing his family. It's still fun to see Christopher Lloyd in an action movie, although he unfortunately gets less screen time than in the first film. Still, he manages to deliver some comedic moments.The villains, unfortunately, come across as weaker this time. There is frequent switching between who is actually the real boss of the criminal organization. As a result, you spend more time with Lendina's subordinates than with her herself, making her less impactful as the final boss. She comes across more as someone who manages everything from behind the scenes, without you having spent enough time with her to really find her interesting.",

Kind of over the top for the sake of being over the top. It just wasn't believable. The sheriff's vibes in the movie were a lot more of a better tone.

The pace is somewhat the same as the first, focusing a bit more on the fun than the first film. It's a comedy-centric film, the darker humor once more well-timed, presented, and crammed into every facet as Hutch faces yet another conspiracy hiding under his nose. I laughed a lot with the one-liners and the temper jokes, enjoying the slightly demented slice of life into an action scene that somehow feels a perfect poke against the one-man army genre. Nobody 2 maintains the charisma of the film, somehow keeping the wacky action, laughs, and depth decently present as we just go on a family vacation. It's a nice blend, still holding that entertainment factor, with performances that still feel just as raw and well-executed as I expected in the film. Character development isn't too bad, a nice little mini-dive into a new facet of our traumatized hero, this time bringing a new weakness into the mix to try and overcome to give Nobody's saga a little more dimension. Fortunately, it doesn't get in the way of the action, still blowing a gaping hole into the franchise with that stylish choreography that brings a video game's variety and edge to the big screen. Plenty of hand-to-hand combat and gunplay will light up the screen, and though there is some carnage and gore, Tiahianto's crew still manages to garnish it up to be manageable for all but the most squeamish stomach. Finally, the visual and audio elements come together to help add some theater-worthy elements to the film. The sound is very loud in this film, but it pulls you into all the chaos and does not apologize for all the explosive sound effects that they have in their arsenal. Nobody 2 also brings wicked visuals (as mentioned before) with a comical sheen to the action, and plenty of exciting sequences that bring our collector's assassin skills to new levels of chaos that seem to parody Wick's darker and more intense moves. Add in a killer soundtrack to mix things up, once again adding some flair to the moments, and Nobody 2 has once again proven to be a unique entry into this genre. If I had to summarize the likes in one sentence, it's that the film is just fun, another escape from reality that some movies fail to accomplish.DISLIKES:\nNeeds More Story\nMore RZA\nA Little More Comedy Balance\nBetter Villain\nNot Quite As Balanced\nMore Christopher Lloyd\nSummary:\nBeing the picky reviewer, the second movie still needed some more build-up to match what I loved in the first film so well. For one thing, I wanted a story again. I'll admit that the first movie's tale wasn't the biggest, mind-blowing piece to grace the theaters, but it had a little more logic, build, and development. Hutch's second journey focuses much more on the spectacle, leaving some of the storylines dangling with limited investment, exploration, or even purpose when they were cut so short. This is true for two of my other favorite characters, RZA and Lloyd's characters, who had a lot more punch in the first movie when Hutch gets pulled back into his career. We get a few snippets and some cool moments that push them into their inclusion, but I saw so much more potential with the characters than just shoving them into the background. Character utilization is quite less impressive for me, and I had hoped we could have had just that same integration in the past to help uncover this mystery. Sadly, the comedy antics and over-the-top action become the obsession, and that's where the film needs to tone it back to strike that balance I liked so much more in the first installment. In addition, a better villain could have saved the day as well. Our newest villain feels in line with the new direction, but outside of an aggressively foul mouth, some wicked style, and exaggerated dancing worthy of a new TikTok dance craze...she kind of is a laughable villain who did little but bring some great lines to the movie, I found to be the most clever. There is plenty of enjoyment in the film, don't get me wrong on that, but again, there is some balance, time expansion, and a little more planning needed to help rein in the ridiculous meter in a bit.The VERDICT:\nI had a lot of fun with the second movie and found this film to be exactly what the trailers promised it would be: a movie theater blast. It's all about the pizazz of the series, bringing over-the-top fights and comedy that will appeal to those with a sense of humor geared to darker themes. It moves fast, keeps the laughs up, and keeps the temper-driven antics in full throttle, yet keeps the violence and tone light enough with the satire to help buffer things. With great visuals and audio support and plenty of moments to laugh at, the sequel accomplishes much for being that fun night out to kill some time and break free from the stresses of the world. However, the movie is a step down from the first film, still shying away from the balance with characters, story, action, and comedy out of sync that I think needed a little more planning. While I never expected this to be the Oscar-worthy story or movie, I had hoped for the same level of development the first held, and that's not quite there. Thus, go there knowing you are going to be exposed to just an overly silly cinematic piece that is just fun and stupid to watch. Worth the theater visit? I think so, mainly for the fun and visual/audio aid. My scores are:\nAction/Comedy/Crime/Thriller: 7.5\nMovie Overall: 6.5-7.0.",

Tjahjanto, known for his work on action films like The Night Comes for Us, brings a distinct, stylized flair to the violence, turning the tranquil setting of a small town and an amusement park into a series of deadly playgrounds. The plot is thin and largely exists to string together these incredible set pieces, but that's not a criticism-the movie knows exactly what it is. It's a joyful, unpretentious action romp. The action is more outlandish and even more graphic than the original, with a dark, cartoonish sense of humor that differentiates it from the more grounded, noirish tone of the first film.Some critics have noted that the sequel loses some of the original's gritty charm in favor of a more comedic, outlandish style, but praise the film for being an entertaining and satisfying follow-up.Is it worth watching?

The tension isn't in the jump scares-it's in the silence between glances, the way a sheriff's badge catches the light just a little too sharply. His camera lingers like a vulture circling, and the editing? Tight. No wasted movement. You'll feel every minute of its 148 runtime, but not because it drags. Because it grinds.Joaquin Phoenix as the sheriff? He's all coiled ambition and swallowed rage, a man who's mastered the art of smiling without it touching his eyes. Emma Stone? She's in her element here, shifting from warmth to withering skepticism like a switchblade flicking open. And Pedro Pascal-quiet, calculating, a performance that says more in a raised eyebrow than most do in monologues.If you're expecting another Midsommar, adjust your sights. This is a different breed-a dark comedy dressed in cowboy boots, where the jokes land like gut punches. The humor's bone-dry, the violence matter-of-fact, and the existential dread? Oh, it's there. Lurking in the background like a bad habit you can't quit.Is it perfect? No. The third act's ambition occasionally outpaces its grip, and not every metaphor sticks the landing.

The trailer promises a stylish neo-Western satire set against the surreal and emotionally charged backdrop of 2020's pandemic-era America. You've got a stacked cast, a topical setup, and the unique flavor of Ari Aster's direction. On paper, this thing had all the ingredients to be one of the year's best. But what we actually get is a film so self-indulgent, bloated, and exhausting, that by the time the movie gets to anything resembling what you saw in the trailer, two hours have passed-and it feels like you've aged an entire year.The story is solid, buried somewhere under the relentless mountain of symbolism, surrealist detours, and exhausting monologues. Joaquin Phoenix, as always, acts his ass off. Pedro Pascal and Emma Stone deliver committed performances, and there are moments...\nbrief moments... of biting satire and darkly funny commentary. But they're drowned under an avalanche of who gives a damn, just get to the damn point.The pacing is brutal. Every time the film seems like it's found a natural stopping point-every time you brace yourself for the sweet release of credits-it starts again. And again. And again.Eddington wants to be everything: a Western, a dark comedy, a political satire, a COVID-era meditation, a psychological thriller. The result is a disjointed, genre-hopping mess. By the end, the film doesn't leave you stunned or speechless-it leaves you drained, begging for it to just end already.Eddington might work for die-hard Aster fans and film school debaters, but for the rest of us, it's a test of endurance-not entertainment, and after this, I'll be cutting my grass with scissors before I sit through another Ari Aster film.",

Where do I even begin?When scrolling on Instagram a while ago, I saw a short reel of Ari Aster talking after this film premiered at the Cannes film festival. Once the applause died now, I believe his first words were \"sorry, I guess?\" I do not know the quote verbatim, but he jokingly apologized for the film. It is easy to see the need for an apology just an hour into the film. Eddington is riddled with politics, controversy, violence, and surprisingly, some of the best dark humor I have ever seen in cinema. We finally have a fictional movie that truly addresses tensions in America during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is one hell of a movie.Meet Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix), the sheriff of Eddington. He may not want to wear a mask everywhere he goes (and claims it is due to asthma), but that does not make him a bad person. Not yet, at least.And meet the current mayor of Eddington, Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal). He reminds Joe that there is a mandate in place to wear a mask in public, but at least he is polite about it while reminding Joe that it is just a safety precaution.The first hour of the movie pokes fun at such behavior from both sides of the issue, which is a very bold thing to do only five years after the timeline in which this story takes place. But this is just a precursor to how tensions will quickly escalate from more serious issues, both political and personal, once the first act ends with Cross announcing his run for mayor of Eddington.Now, while I would likely not agree with Cross' behavior towards COVID if I was back in 2020 when the movie takes place, Cross has noble, and understandable, qualities such as wanting to treat everybody more like human beings than like toddlers during uncertain times. Is he a conservative since he dismisses COVID? Well... who cares? It does not matter what side of the political spectrum he falls on, but the important thing is while some see him as selfish, to others he is a kind and caring human being.At first.One thing that the movie does very well is that while it brings up political divide and tensions which were happening in 2020, it attempts to remain unbiased, showing both the good stuff and the bad stuff coming from each \"side.\" There is a lot of first amendment auditing in the movie, but before videos get posted to Instagram, it is shown in the movie that a lot of what actually makes it to the social media platform is taken completely out of context. Even minor subplots are filled with notions that certain biases definitely exist through manipulation of technology and the use of social media.This review may not feel complete, but I think I have to stop myself here before I begin to spoil anything about the second half of the movie. But I will leave you all with this... I think Phoenix's performance is incredible in this film because there is a \"point of no return\" moment in which I decided that Joe Cross becomes one of the worst fictional human beings I have ever seen portrayed on film.I am not going to say this movie will not offend you, because there is a great chance that it will, but I think this film needs to be seen. It is controversial and hilarious, and I also think it challenges me to think about the world and try to remain less biased and more understanding of opposing points of view.10/10.",

            "review": "Describing Eddington as a neo-western might be the most fitting way to summarise Ari Aster's 2025 dark comedy-drama-though even that hardly scratches the surface.That said, I felt I needed a full ten minutes of silence after the credits rolled, just to process what I'd witnessed.It's an Ari Aster film, after all, so if you're familiar with his work, you'll know to expect a whirlwind of emotional and thematic disarray. But Eddington isn't just messy-it's exquisite, unfiltered chaos.If you've seen the trailer, don't be misled. It barely teases the disorienting spiral that unfolds. The story kicks off in May 2020, amidst the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.What begins as a snapshot of public hysteria-conspiracy theories, anti-vaxxers, and the fear-soaked atmosphere-rapidly morphs into something darker and more disturbingly real.We've spent the past five years collectively unmoored-adrift in chaos, where appearances deceive and identities dissolve. It sometimes feels like a failed social mutation-one born from freedom pushed to its breaking point-an evolutionary misstep we fought to achieve, only to have it turn against us.Let's be clear: freedom is a vital human right. But when it becomes indistinguishable from anarchic self-destruction, something has clearly gone awry.At its core, Eddington follows a standoff between small-town sheriff Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix) and Mayor Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal), set in the fictional town of Eddington, New Mexico.Their clash is both personal and political-complicated by Garcia's fraught history with Cross's wife, Louise (Emma Stone), and mother-in-law, Dawn (Deirdre O'Connell).Aster revisits his obsession with overbearing maternal figures, folding that tension seamlessly into the wider conflict as the two men find themselves on opposing sides of the mask debate.The film is deliberately provocative, often hollow by design, and it's a difficult piece to review. You'll laugh, you'll wince, you'll question what you're watching-and you certainly won't find it comforting.Aster touches on themes like racial division, though arguably without much new to say. The Black Lives Matter movement is clearly present in the film's DNA, but its representation feels muddled-more gestured at than fully explored.Before it can fully engage with those ideas, the film veers off into another subplot filled with irrationality, violence, and distraction-perhaps intentionally mirroring how public attention shifted in real time.What he does capture is the paranoia, anxiety, and social fragmentation that exploded when lockdowns began and the world collectively panicked. He blends it into a fever dream of confusion and satire, offering no answers-just raw sensation.Much of the chaos is filtered through the lens of social media, which becomes the film's true stage. It's where the news is curated, where lies take root, and where misinformation thrives.To emphasize this aspect, the film extensively employs the screenlife technique, blending traditional storytelling with found-footage and mockumentary styles. And let me tell you, it works remarkably well, enhancing the overall sense of realism.Paranoia spreads like wildfire, jokes mutate into threats, and morality dissolves into a game of psychological warfare, disinformation, and mass manipulation.Unsurprisingly, Eddington has sharply divided critics-and will likely do the same with audiences. Expect fiery debates. Some will praise its fearless ambition; others will dismiss it as bloated, incoherent, or pretentious. And honestly, that may be exactly what Aster intended.As always, his visual storytelling is exceptional. Darius Khondji's cinematography (Uncut Gems, The Immigrant) balances the film's absurdity and dread with a sharp, immersive eye. Lucian Johnston's editing keeps the pacing surprisingly taut, especially for a film that thrives on disorientation.Aster's visual language for violence remains as potent as ever. When revenge time comes, it hits with darkly funny moments-especially during 'The Antifa Massacre,' which delivers shocking laughs and gory satisfaction in true Ari Aster fashion.But after all that-did I like it?There's brilliance in Eddington-but perhaps brilliance trapped in a maze of its own ambition, leaving something essential just out of reach.The ride remains undeniably compelling. Ari Aster remains one of the most fascinating directors working today.But, as with Beau Is Afraid, he tests the limits of narrative and patience. There's brilliance in Eddington, but there's also a sense of something missing-maybe too much of everything, all at once.This isn't a comfort film to watch. It won't leave you with a clear head. In fact, you'll probably leave the cinema clutching your skull, trying to piece together the fragments.My advice? Watch it with a good friend-or a few-who appreciate psychologically demanding cinema.Because once the screen fades to black, the real film begins-in your head, and in the conversations that follow.",

            "review": "Ari Aster's Eddington is a feverish, kaleidoscopic descent into the American psyche during the COVID-19 pandemic-a film that aspires to be a modern Dr. Strangelove but often resembles a fever dream in a funhouse mirror. Set in a fictional New Mexico town, it follows Sheriff Joe Cross (Joaquin Phoenix) as he spirals into political and personal chaos, clashing with Mayor Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal) amid a backdrop of mask mandates, conspiracy theories, and societal unraveling.Aster's ambition is palpable, weaving a tapestry of political satire, dark comedy, and surreal horror. The film's visual style, marked by stark contrasts and unsettling imagery, mirrors the disorienting nature of the pandemic era. Phoenix delivers a performance that oscillates between manic energy and tragic vulnerability, capturing the essence of a man undone by his own delusions.However, Eddington often falters under the weight of its own ambition. The narrative, overstuffed with themes ranging from political polarization to performative activism, lacks the coherence necessary to deliver its message effectively. While Aster critiques both the far-right and the performative left, the film's satire occasionally veers into cynicism, offering little in the way of nuanced commentary.The film's pacing suffers as well; its 145-minute runtime feels bloated, with sequences that drag and moments that seem indulgent rather than essential. The tonal shifts-from dark comedy to horror to political allegory-can be jarring, leaving the audience disoriented rather than enlightened.In the end, Eddington is a film that strives for profundity but often settles for spectacle. It is a cinematic reflection of internet outrage, a mirror held up to a society in turmoil, but one that sometimes obscures more than it reveals. While it offers moments of insight and flashes of brilliance, it ultimately falls short of its lofty aspirations.5/10. Expected a lot more.",

            "review": "In 2019, Ari Aster struck many film fans as the new face of horror and quickly attached him to the genre. In 2025, Ari Aster has departed from that stereotype and is now seen (at least in my opinion) as a director who makes very polarizing and ambitious films that he wants to make. I gotta respect the guy for going out and doing that. Eddington, much like his 2023 film \"Beau is Afraid\" is that kind of film. It's ridiculously ambitious, busy, and absolutely bonkers. It's something that I feel only Aster could make. I'll agree with the critics when they say Aster covers a lot of subjects but doesn't really commit to most of them. He seems to kind of get lost in the moment of trying to satirize and summarize too many subjects of the COVID pandemic to the point of exhaustion. It's not his most successful film and it's certainly not going to please everyone, but I greatly admire the drive he put into it.",

I am a fan of his work from films like \"Inherent Vice\", \"Two Lovers\", \"Buffalo Soldiers\", \"Her\", \"Napoleon\", \"Irrational Man\", \"Gladiator\", \"Walk the Line\", and \"The Master\". And of course he won the Oscar for best actor for \"Joker\".Now he stars in a new movie called \"Eddington\" directed by Ari Aster. I know that Ari Aster previously directed the films \"Hereditary\", \"Midsommer\", and \"Beau is Afraid\". But I have not seen any of those.The story takes place in the fictional town of Eddington, New Mexico during May of 2020, the time of the coronavirus pandemic. It starts with people arguing about whether or not they should have to wear face masks to protect them from the virus.Joaquin plays the local sheriff who clashes with the mayor, played by Pedro Pascal in a supporting role. Then Joaquin's character decides to run for mayor himself.The story escalates into some violence but is never less than compelling and entertaining. This is one of the better movies I have seen this year. Also with an excellent supporting cast including Emma Stone and Austin Butler.Also with good cinematography from Darius Khondji, who was nominated for \"Bardo false chronicle of a handful of truths\" and \"Evita\".This film is very much worth seeing in a movie theater.

The ever busy Pedro Pascal and always adventurous Joaquin Phoenix are great as Mayor and Sheriff at political odds in the tiny town of Eddington, New Mexico (really Truth or Consequences) with mask restrictions that drove many a citizen crazy in 2020-1 (the plot only seems a bit of an overreach by conflating AI into the mix, an issue that really didn't enter the national conversation until late 2022 at the earliest). Emma Stone is very funny as Joaquin's doll-obsessed, frigid wife, and the film has a charming, homespun quality that recalls other New Mexico-set films like \"Welcome To Mooseport\" and \"White Sands\" (I tried to be an extra when it filmed a year ago this past April but missed the window, finding only \"Welcome Eddington!\" marquees at various drive-ins). With NM's usually vibrant film scene slowed to a snail's pace due to tariffs and such (Superman was essentially fighting a fitter, younger Don), it's great we still have challenging, well-written films like this emerging in 2025 among all the usual play-it-safe remakes and reboots. Check out Eddington; at least it'll give you something to talk about.",

            "review": "So, what does dark comedy mean, exactly ... ?\"Eddington,\" which falls under that genre on the Internet Movie Database, isn't the first movie that's left me asking the question. It's just the most recent.The film is also labeled a Contemporary Western, a concept easier to grasp.Eddington is the name of a tiny, out-of-the-way New Mexico town, grappling - as the rest of the country was when the story opens in 2020 - with the outbreak of the Covid pandemic.You can't get much more contemporary than that.Written and directed by Ari Aster, who has developed a cult following for leading audiences into scary sometimes gross places, its cast is heavy with Oscar winners and nominees. Joaquin Phoenix, Emma Stone, Pablo Pascal, Dierdre O'Connell, Michael Ward and Austen Butler, for openers.Phoenix plays Eddington's Sheriff Joe Cross, a sad-sack lawman who's got about as much as he can handle with his wife Louise (Stone) who doesn't love him ; her mother Dawn (O'Connell) whose favorite pastime is Googling conspiracy theories; and that Covid mask mandate that he's supposed to be enforcing.Joe's got asthma, you see, which makes it hard for him to breathe whenever he tries to put the danged mask on.Joe's not a political person, per se. The circumstances that lead him to run against incumbent Ted Garcia (Pascal) to become Eddington's mayor are more a matter of being pushed past his breaking point by one too many matters beyond his control.There's the new AI data center that's been proposed for development that has local conservationists up in arms. There's the George Floyd killing in Minneapolis that's all over the news and has the town's teenage population rioting on Main Street. There's the loco crazy homeless guy, who always shows up to make matters worse. There are the rumors that the current mayor slept with Sheriff Joe's wife, before unceremoniously dumping her ...\nAha, so maybe dark comedy is about trying to find the yuks in what Henry David Thoreau called \"lives of quiet desperation.\" That was the way Thoreau described \"the mass of men\" in his 1854 masterpiece \"Walden.\" No one has summed things up better in the almost two centuries since.Or maybe dark comedy is more a matter of dystopian satire, trying to whistle our way past the graveyard of civilization.Whatever it's called, writer-director Aster clearly has a lot on his mind before he lets the action onscreen devolve into a hail of unholy gunfire, explosions and chaos in the third act.Considering that they're both running for mayor, it's noteworthy what horrible communicators Sheriff Joe and incumbent Ted Garcia are. Joe has a habit of speaking his mind before his mind's made up. Ted is way better in TV commercials than in actuality. Both guys reveal the absence of anything like actual confidence every time they open their mouths.The real powers in their world are behind the scenes, creating that water-sucking, resource-depleting high-tech data center, or infiltrating high-minded political demonstrations with false flag mercenaries\nLike an old-fashioned - as opposed to contemporary - Western, \"Eddington's\" setting is as much a character as the characters are. The saloon, church and wooden sidewalks may now be replaced with convenience marts, an historic Indian museum and a very convenient gun and ammo store, but there's still the sense of flimsy storefronts standing lonesome vigils a long way from the hills on the horizon on those windswept plains.Likewise, Sheriff Joe's iPhone isn't in the credits, but it play a role as important as any character in the story. \"Eddington\" may be the first work of art made of misinformation. Social media is where that misinformation comes to life, festers and spreads like fungus. There's nothing like smart technology for making people stupid. Once you create artificial intelligence, actual intelligence is a flimsy defense indeed.When it comes to polarized idiocy, filmmaker Aster doesn't take sides. The self-styled high-minded liberals are as gullible to online fictions as your standard garden-variety bigot. Some of the film's funniest scenes come when the teen demonstrators protesting the George Floyd killings tie themselves in moral knots trying to deny their own class and privilege. Aster's script suggests that actual pedophiles may far outnumber figments of conspiracy theory imagination - and may not be limited to one political party or another.\"Eddington\" may be a work of genius. That's a saving grace, considering that none of its characters are particularly likable, it's disquieting to sit through, and its so-called humor hardly lightens the mood as you exit the theater into the actual dystopia waiting outside.",

In the end, I did not like this filmAs usual, I'll begin first with what I actually liked. I feel that the film, particularly in the opening portions, offers some evocative commentary about 2020 society, with Covid and race-riots. For example, the movie has one scene where a supermarket rigidly enforces COVID protocols, and the people indoors look so silly when they follow certain rules, such as walking through aisles only in the direction of the arrows on the ground . The movie pokes fun at both sides, yet it still captures how foolish and even insane the world became at the time.I also like the opening back-and-forth exchanges between Pedro Pascal and Joaquim Phoenix, which occur early in the movie. Phoenix, in particular, shows some good acting. I give the movie some credit for it's portrayal of this nondescript small-town in New Mexico; the town of Eddington seems like a character itselfBut as I said -- I did not like this movie overall. The movie is slow, dry, and plodding; it's not fun to watch. A lot of the scenes contain fluff. None of the characters are likable and fun to watch. The overall vibe gets a bit too downcast at times. By the 1 hour and 15-minute mark, I was ready for this movie's story to wrap up. Instead, there was an hour to go.The scenes with Emma Stone's character are a drag. Honestly, I have no clue what the deal is with her character. Likewise, Austin Butler appears in one scene that is so vague, boring, and tedious. When his scene ended, I found myself wondering what in the world I just watched. It was as if the film just wanted to cram an Austin Butler cameo for whatever reason. Perhaps they just wanted to boast that an Oscar-nominee is in the film, or they wanted to use his name/image for marketingLastly - the film goes a bit off-the-rails at the end, almost changing genres entirely. I found it to be awkward, uneven, and too drawn-out. It felt more like like they tacked on some other's movie's ending to this one.4.5 /10.",

Even with the aftereffects and hypocrisy being shown by both sides, the root of fundamental belief makes a difference, which, as fit for an American movie, this avoids addressing.

Eddington is an unsuspecting thrill ride with plenty of laughs, classic western callbacks, fresh new characters, and gut punching scenes.The action is ramped up compared to Aster's previous films. It's a step out to show the violent, defensive side of America bubbling up through our cast of characters. In typical Aster fashion, though, the brute force is reserved for about the second half of the movie exclusively. It's very hard to call this an action movie in that case, but Aster's films are impossible to define by their genre any way.The laughs and comedic moments are better than ever in Eddington. All the visual gags and reoccurring jokes aid the uncanny feeling of reality. Many real Americans talk and act the way characters do in Eddington. The most effective way to cope is to observe and laugh. It never feels like Aster is trying to push a political agenda with the comedy in Eddington. It comes from a place of trying to highlight the ridiculous absurdity that is America in 2020.The western callbacks and references are backed in the films DNA. None of the western moments feel like after thoughts. The stand offs, walking in places the character shouldn't, and bad guys rolling in on the horizon all feel whole-heartedly Eddington. These western callbacks aren't just tacked on to call it a western. The references are deliberately placed and feel well planned to suit the story.Overall, I will be seeing Eddington in theaters again. The theater I saw it in on Thursday, opening night, had maybe 10 people in it. Everybody laughed, squirmed, and moaned, but it wasn't enough for a single viewing.

Now to be fair, I was a little worried if the filmmakers were going to be able to make a good sequel to that movie because Disney has had a rough couple of years, but I'm happy to say that this movie was good.Positives for Freakier Friday (2025):\nLindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis kill it in this movie and they recapture the magic and charm of their performances from the 2003 movie while also being in different places in life. It feels like they never left these roles and they set down into these characters like the 2003 movie came out last year. I did like some of the new characters particularly Julia Butters and Sophia Hammons as the two stepdaughters of Lindsay Lohan's character. You do get some nice callbacks of the 2003 movies and they didn't feel like cheap fan service. The plot of the movie is different enough from the original to help it stand out instead of feeling like a cheap copy of what happened 22 years ago with the characters. And finally, the insanity of the premise is still intact with everything that happens in this movie and that make me very happy.Mixed for Freakier Friday (2025):\nThere is still a nature to the story not making any logical sense as to what is going on, but I don't care because I was having fun with it.Negatives for Freakier Friday (2025):\nThe movie does feel it is overstuffed with subplots and characters who feel like they shouldn't even be here and they did drag the movie a a lot for me. Honestly, I did forget some of the subplots as they felt so random and pointless that if you took them out of the story, you would still have the same movie. And finally, there is one scene that literally exists for product placement and it was so hilariously dumb that this scene actually made it into the final product.Overall, Freakier Friday (2025) is a good continuation of the 2003 movie and it was fun to see these characters getting back to the insanity of the story from 22 years ago and I am happy to say that.",

I was worried at first because this was supposed to be a straight to Disney+ movie. So I did not know what to expect. But I'm pleased to say this legacy sequel keeps everything great about that movie while still having its own heart felt moments to it. Lindsay Lohan, and Jamie Lee Curtis are back! And are as great as ever. Even after all these years they are still able to make these characters work. They are both two different characters, and they both absolutely sell it on both of them and make you believe that they are actually two different characters. It's just the right comedic timing and acting. It's so believable. And even the new cast of kids they have in here, same thing goes for them. They do actually feel like the older cast of characters. And thats whats so fun about playing a role like this, you're able to change your personality up and be over the top and make it work. It's crazy that even 20 years later, not only the actors, but the script, the story, all still works and feels like it's only been a few years after the original film. The comedy is still as funny as always, the story is still that classic freaky Friday story, but with more heart. Yes, we still keep that classic formula. But this time since there's four characters being swapped around, and kids trying to change up their parents marriage. It adds for this whole new layer of satisfaction near the end. The character arcs had a meaning and they went through something because you cared for the characters. It had more meaning because of that extra layer you decided to put on. It is not just a mother daughter banter, this time it's the whole family banter and that's why it works better. Now, this is not better than the original film. No one was expecting it to be. But it is still very much on the same par as the original film because it still keeps everything great about the original film, just 20 years later. But of course, the movie is still predictable, we've seen this formula before you seen this type of movie before you know how it's gonna end. But the journey to get there and that heartfelt ending is what makes it worth watching. If you have nostalgia for that original film or just love the freaky Friday movies this is your thing, but if you did not grow up on that, don't know what this is. Don't check this out. It's probably not for you.",

However, for some reason I think that 35+ year old people will appreciate it more than youngsters, especially us millenial Lindsey Lohan fans who grew up with her excellent movies in the 90s and 00s. I must admit I'm really happy she got her life back together and is acting again.On the negative side, it would have been a bit better if this was a 90 minute movie, which I find to be a perfect length for comedies. I really hope that Naked Gun and this movie will be the start of a big screen comedy comeback because last 10 years have been horrible to comedies.",

            "review": "I just got out of Freakier Friday.A legacy sequel to a fun remake. What can go wrong??Not a lot, really, I liked the Jodie Foster version and had fun with the remake. This was when Lohan was at the top of her games.Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis are front and centre in this, (which I'm glad about, as I was worried the younger cast were going to dominate) and they still play well off each other!! There scenes were my favourite in the movie. The other girls, Julia Butters who plays Lohan's daughter (and later Lohan) and Sophia Hammond who plays Lohan's soon to be daughter in law (and later Jamie Lee Curtis) are both great, too. Manny Jacinto is perfect as Lohan's husband to be, Mark Harmon is back, but isn't given much to do and I don't think he even shared a scene with Lohan.The ending is quite emotional, it does have a lot of heart to it. Especially if you have kids or have lost a parent.This feels like this was filmed as a streaming movie, that the decided to go theatrical, with. It just feels small scale. It is a bit convoluted and the swapping around is more than a bit confusing at first. A few times, I had to take a minute and think who I was watching!! It has pacing issues, but when the premise is this complicated, it's to be expected and the dialogue can often be clunky and awkward.Overall I liked it, it was good to see Lohan back on the big screen.",

Instead, it just seems to hash over the same story beats as the first film, but this time with an additional body swap scenario that added nothing of real value and just made the whole thing feel a bit messy.In fact, this is my main gripe with the film. Having Jamie Lee Curtis' Tess swap bodies with Sophia Hammons' Lily just seems utterly pointless. It was shoehorned in so that Jamie Lee Curtis could be let loose, but it served no real emotional value. It was also very annoying that the two characters didn't act like they were in the other's body! After the swap, they just felt like two completely different characters. At least with Lindsey Lohan and Julia Butters, they actually felt like they were playing the other character.Aside from this major gripe, the plot also just felt a bit repetitive of the first film just with more people. It also was hard to root for the main characters as they are trying to split up a loving relationship, and considering the end was so obvious what was going to happen it makes the journey there a little tiresome at times.Ultimately though I know this film shouldn't be taken so seriously. It's tongue in cheek and it does have lots of good comedy, and the emotional moments are strong when they focus on Lindsey Lohan's Anna and her daughter. The performances are all pretty good, and I think Manny Jacinto as Anna's fiance is a great addition.Despite being a let down compared to the original one, it is still funny enough and is worth a watch for fans of the first film.",

            "review": "LIKES:\nCute\nCharming\nNostalgic\nReferences\nGreat Music\nGood Acting\nDeep At Times/Heartwarming\nSome Comedic Gold\nSummary:\nLike most Disney pieces, there is always some factor of cuteness in the film. Freakier Friday continues to add that family-friendly element (for ages above like eleven) that holds elements that we always loved in our Disney Channel originals. Fun little bouts of youthful deviousness mixed with family bonding are much of this film, jokes finding their way into that peppy energy I loved in my teens, but with just a touch of modern maturity to help it. It's a charming adventure for the coming-of-age genre, characters finding footholds to still get better despite the past, helping to illustrate that sometimes we need to learn lessons a few times to get it right. Such elements come with the same Disney presentation, that element of fun, awkward antics, getting us toward the lessons in that clumsy style that will be uncomfortable, but in many cases, fun as old and new once again debate over who is superior. Amid the \"old\" is the nostalgia factor that we love to capitalize on and dive back into. The references are plenty, many new twists or nods to the original that are fun, many turned to help advance the story, or put that right joke into the movie. Some of it is a little heavy-handed or stretched, but I had fun seeing it integrated into the story, especially those comedic gold moments that were so clever that my friend and I laughed out loud for several seconds. Finally, the movie still has the Disney finesse of pulling at your heartstrings, fantastically crafted moments that blend all the Hollywood magic into those memorable moments. Add in the music, a soundtrack that is vibing in so many styles that feel representative of the generations to further help Disney's live action movie feel fun, a few tracks having me tap my toes in glee as I bobbed to the beat.Outside of these qualities, Freakier Friday thrives well on the speeches and dialogue, with solid delivery and background music to help enhance the moment, executed to a grand degree by the cast. I enjoyed all four of the performances, the talented women finding some depth to their performances and accomplishing two roles trapped in one body with some impressive acting ability. Sophia Hammons has poise, panache, and a bratty attitude that her accent sells with such finesse. When the swap occurs, she gets the mannerisms of her switched persona well, making not only the fashion look wonderful, but also the deeper moments at times. Butters was very enjoyable, a mashup of so many personalities that it was hard to choose which form I preferred; all have a good place in this film. But the champions are who you most likely want to hear about, and Lohan continues to redeem herself with roles that have tapped back into her roots, but excelled into mature means that are a nice blend of qualities. Lohan's execution of two personalities worked for me, and I love the dynamic range that she brings with this fun performance. It's Curtis who steals a lot of the show for me, the seasoned actress continuing to look good and own the moments, no matter how silly they are. I love the chemistry between them, the fun energy familiar in many ways, with some moments again a perfect mixture of talent and writing.DISLIKES:\nPredictable\nCheesy\nToo Silly\nPacing Issues\nSome Story Elements That Needed More\nSome Aggressive Comedy\nToo Niche\nFeels Not The Same Caliber As The First\nSummary:\nWhere the movie starts to fail for me comes in the modernization elements that most movies have taken in this age of viewing. As expected, this sequel does not escape the predictable formula this franchise takes, the path not exactly identical to the first film, but incredibly similar as they search for the answers to their predicament. Freakier Friday's fun helps to dilute some of the predictability, though it doesn't do much for the very cheesy and overly silly moments Disney writing brings with it in modern times. Jokes are very much in your face, with a lot of rough patches of over-aggressive one-liners, corny callouts, and exaggerated jokes that may cross into insulting territory depending on your sensitivity. Such aggressive comedy feels very influencer in tone, the attempts to cram so much simplistic silliness are a bit exhausting at times, with only some relief coming from those awesome comedic moments.Other elements that suffered for me were the pacing issues, the film having a bit uneven pace as it went from highs to lows so abruptly that the plot felt disconnected compared to the golden age of live-action storytelling. The story elements are there, providing enough of a bridge, but they felt so unequal in quality, with many characters wasted and lacking the involvement the first one did so well. Key obstacles felt truncated, qualities missing those full-impactful moments, not quite there with many characters' fun cameos for a quick blast to the past, but needing something more to be worth the inclusion than just a fun joke. Too many characters? Too much trying to be integrated? Too focused on the new? I'm not sure, but the story just needs some more polishing and advancements to obtain the same caliber as the first, instead of following into this niche that my friend and I feel this movie is targeted at pleasing.The VERDICT:\nFreakier Friday is one of the better modernizations of a sequel I have seen in a while. There is respect for the old story, but also plenty of new things to help it be its own film, which should be pleasing to the audience. It's a fun movie, some of that Disney magic coming out in full force to make a charming and enchanting film for most families. Great performances help bring the characters to the forefront, nailing double performance expectations, selling some comedic gold moments, and helping pump the theater up with energy that I like my Disney films to have. Other elements help the film flourish in the form of fun lines and good music, giving us that 2000s feeling at times that I loved diving back into after all these years. Sadly, the movie's modern influences are a little more prevalent than I would like, primarily in the story and over-aggressive comedy that has been popular since the mid-2010s. They can be funny at times, some of the clever moments helping cut through the thicket of jokes that are in your face and focused on demographic topics, primarily ageist jokes. While the awkward moments can be funny, the movie concentrates on the jokes a bit too much, not handling the story progression as well as the first. Cute as it may be, alongside some key scene moments, the uneven pacing and quality are what sort of cut this film's quality down a few pegs. It's not bad, that's not what I'm saying. I just think that it's a much more niche film than the first, matching a caliber that feels like a high-quality Disney+ Channel original movie rather than a full blockbuster feature. Is it worth a trip to the theater? For the target audience of moms with daughters this age, or a group of moms looking for a nostalgia trip, this is your movie to have fun with. For the rest, wait for the inevitable release on streaming to maximize your time. My scores for Freakier Friday are:\nComedy/Family/Fantasy: 7.0-7.5\nMovie Overall: 6.5.",

Ever since The Notebook, tons and tons of the cliched, cheesy and annoying romance stories have been made and this one is just the same as every other ones. Director Lasse Hallstrom has made some wonderful movies throughout his career that I have liked but unfortunately, his recent works have been lacking badly and here, his direction and approach feels lifeless and aimless.With stereotypical atmospheres and presentations of Europe, the performances are the best aspects. Cline and Apa offers the best they can have with the clunky dialogue and chemistry, which the two does succeeds as they do offer some good moments, charm, and connections.

She delivers a fantastic and natural performance, bringing a genuine charm and emotional authenticity to her character. Her presence on screen is captivating and makes the journey worthwhile, even when the plot itself falters.The film's premise and initial setup are good, hinting at a heartfelt and adventurous story. However, as the narrative progresses, it fails to fully captivate or grip the audience. The pacing can be uneven, and the story seems to meander without a sense of urgency or compelling stakes. This lack of consistent engagement makes the film feel less impactful than it could have been.While the film may have its heartwarming moments and a visually pleasant aesthetic, these positives are often overshadowed by a narrative that lacks a compelling hook. It's a movie that you can watch, but it doesn't leave a strong lasting impression.Overall, \"The Map That Leads to You\" is a good one-time watch, primarily for Madelyn Cline's excellent performance.

In the movie, Heather, the main girl, was all set to start a regular office job after her graduation trip, ready to jump into the typical city life. But who would've guessed she'd run into Jack, that adventure-seeking guy? Their meeting was like two stars on totally different paths suddenly crossing-sparks flew, and it was such a cool vibe.Gotta say, the actors did a great job. KJ Apa, who plays Jack, totally nailed that laid-back, always-up-for-anything energy. And Madelyn Cline as Heather? She killed it with the emotional shifts-from being kinda lost and stuck on her planned future at first, to gradually changing as Jack pulls her out of her shell. I heard the director was super chill on set, no strict scripts, and the actors just went with whatever felt natural. That's probably why the emotions feel so real-it's easy to get pulled into their world.The visuals are stunning too. They filmed in Porto, Portugal, and all these spots in Spain, and every frame looks like a painting. Sunlight hitting the old streets, the buildings with that unique charm, and the wide-open natural scenery-it's all so relaxing, like you're right there on that romantic European trip with them.Story-wise, it's not the kind with big twists or nonstop action. It's more about the little moments between Heather and Jack as they travel, showing how their feelings grow and how Heather starts to find herself. They follow Jack's grandpa's diary map, laughing together, bickering a bit, getting to know each other better-and figuring out who they really are. It's a slow burn, no huge drama, but it has this quiet, gentle way of drawing you in, making you feel all that genuine emotion.That said, it's not perfect. For me, the pace is a bit too slow-some parts drag on, and it's easy to zone out. Also, I wish they'd dug deeper into the characters' inner stuff. Some of their more complicated feelings just get a quick mention, leaving you wanting more. But overall, The Map That Leads to You is worth watching.

Regardless of the other \"Variables\" involved, Polly's dad is a hero. Polly, played by Ana Sophia Heger, makes me wish there was a junior category at all the award shows. Maybe some offer it and they should! The chemistry Polly had with her dad Nate, played by Taron Egerton, is insane. Talk about these two actors going through all the emotions: anger, happiness, sadness, scare, fear, hope, anguish...the list never stopped, and these two actors delivered in spades! It is great to see a big, full cast, all working, and contributing to an excellent movie.The whole cast was fantastic, from the leads, to supporting, to short parts, to one-line parts, to non-speaking parts. Each actor made a contribution to creating a great story. Some of the supporting actors are incredibly accomplished actors! Which, for me, is so necessary in these types of drama, action, thriller movies. Especially when relating to the law and police. Good acting is essential to selling me on these roles. The characters and the cast delivered.Tons of great issue(s) that exist today are going on.One thing is for sure, to see that heroes are inside and outside prison, some in law enforcement roles and some not. As well as some bad people in prison and outside it in law enforcement roles and some not. Power corrupts. So it was excellent for someone in law enforcement actually thinking of justice.The music was fantastic.The location is authentic, not saying it's this state in the USA, but then filmed in some foreign country. Rather, it was filmed in Albuquerque and Zia Pueblo, New Mexico. I've been to the former. One cannot fake these regions by going to some foreign country just for \"credits\" AKA money. Rather do the location(s) justice. This vibe comes off in the movie, it is the location(s) they are talking about. I read over 400 New Mexicans were employed for this movie! That is an excellent job.I don't want to give too many spoilers away.Taron Egerton as Nate gave an Oscar-quality performance, an Oscar-winner.There is some strong violence, heavy scenes. But actually, I cried more in this movie than any movie in recent times. Seeing such a great dad-and-daughter relationship (granted major issues going on) blew me away--that unconditional love only a parent can have for their kid(s) is one of the world's greatest gifts! There is no one more instrumental in a child(ern) life than parent(s).I struggled with the ending, but it was more realistic and authentic than the more sentimental one I wanted!The beginning, middle and ending of this movie were fantastic.",

This is further enhanced by the performances of Taron Egerton and Ana Sophia Heger, as the father-daughter duo both of whom have approached their roles with utmost honesty and dedication.Especially, Ana, who at just 11 years of tender age, exhibited an impressive level of maturity and understanding in her performance, making it one of the standout child actor portrayals in recent memory.However, when I shift my focus to the rest of the storytelling, certain cracks become apparent. The subplot involving the local sheriff's drug dealings, the whole operation of 'localised' Meth labs, and the issuance of 'hit marks' feels somewhat contrived and this perception primarily stem from the limited development and materials provided regarding his self-proclaimed 'empire.'",

She Rides Shotgun barrels in with gritty urgency, heart pounding emotion, and two performances that will stay with you long after the credits roll.Taron Egerton as Nate sheds his usual suave charm and instead delivers a tough as nails, tattooed ex con on the run. Ugly world, ugly past, but a man desperate to protect his daughter. Egerton brings such raw, lean menace that you almost forget he once played Elton John. This is character work at its most grounded.Ana Sophia Heger as Polly is absolutely extraordinary. This is one of those rare performances where you stop seeing the actor entirely and only see the character. She brings such honesty, depth, and emotional truth to Polly that it feels less like acting and more like living. Every moment she's on screen is magnetic. She balances vulnerability and strength with a maturity far beyond her years, yet still feels completely natural and age appropriate. It is never forced, never precocious, just deeply human and real. The hardest, most heartbreaking scenes are handled with such grace and rawness that you forget how young she actually is. It is the kind of performance that not only carries a film, but announces the arrival of a major talent. Ana doesn't just keep up with Taron Egerton, she matches him beat for beat and often steals the scene entirely. It is a breathtaking breakout role, and one that people will be talking about for a long time.Together, their chemistry is the heartbeat of the movie. At first you see a scared little girl clinging to scraps of trust, but as the film moves on you watch her transform into a partner in survival. Their bond builds in tiny, fragile steps until suddenly it feels unshakable.Let's talk cinematography. Vast desert landscapes, neon lit motel rooms, hauntingly beautiful sunsets. It's gritty and elegant all at once. The visuals arrest your breath and remind you exactly where you are and how quickly that place can become dangerous.The narrative moves like high velocity noir, leaping from one tense moment to the next. Yes, the plot has familiar beats: ex con on the run, corrupt cops, nasty gangs. But the emotional anchor keeps it from ever feeling stale. It is predictably unpredictable in the best possible way. You may see the scenes coming, but you feel every second of them.In sum: She Rides Shotgun is an action thriller that doesn't just ride shotgun. It drives, bleeding and beautiful, right into your heart. Taron Egerton is phenomenal, but it is Ana Sophia Heger who leaves you floored. Her performance is so believable and raw that you almost forget you are watching a film at all. She turns a gritty thriller into something deeply human, and that is what makes this movie unforgettable.",

But the film's secret weapon is Ana Sophia Heger as 11-year-old Polly... she's fearless without being precocious, heartbreaking without milking tears.Adapting Jordan Harper's acclaimed novel, the screenplay wisely sidesteps sentimental traps that doom similar stories. Instead of sugar-coating trauma, it explores how love can bloom in violence's aftermath. The Aryan Steel gang threat feels menacingly real, grounding the action in consequences that matter.Rowland's direction maintains brutal honesty about what survival costs, both physically and emotionally. While some action sequences feel uneven, the central relationship never wavers. Egerton and Heger's chemistry sells every moment of their unlikely education - he teaches her to fight, she teaches him to feel.The film succeeds because it respects both its characters and audience intelligence. This isn't just another crime thriller with a kid sidekick; it's a meditation on how broken people can heal each other, even while running from the past's shadows.7.5/10 - Gritty, genuine, and surprisingly moving.",

            "review": "'Jaws' is the original summer blockbuster, setting the standard by which all others are measured. It's the Michael Jordan of cinema: there will never be another 'Jaws,' simply because the film so profoundly changed the way movies are made and marketed.Based on Peter Benchley's bestselling novel, 'Jaws' centers around the fictional North Atlantic resort island of Amity, which finds itself terrorized by an enormous great white shark. Our hero is Martin Brody, a New York cop who took the job as Chief of the Amity PD to get his family out of the city and then finds himself in the midst of an unprecedented crisis none of his prior experience has prepared him for. The remains of young Christine Watkins are found on the beach, the apparent victim of a shark attack(Chrissie Watkins' death scene at the opening of the movie is one of the most legendary in the history of film). Chief Brody wants to close the beaches, but is refused permission by Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) and the Amity selectmen, all of whom fear that news of a shark attack off of Amity will threaten the summer tourist trade, on which the town depends for its very survival. The Mayor and his lackies persuade Chief Brody that such incidents are always isolated, and, inexperienced in such matters, he grudgingly agrees to keep quiet.Consequently, the shark kills again (and again), and Chief Brody eventually finds himself dealing both with his own moral guilt for agreeing to hush up the first shark attack and with an enormous human and social catastrophe which appears to be his sole responsibility. Help comes first in the form of Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, in the role that propelled him to stardom), an icthyologist and oceanographer dispatched to Amity to lend his expertise. Together, Hooper and Brody struggle in vain against both the shark and Mayor Vaughan, who is certain that keeping the beaches open for the sake of the town's economy (and his own real-estate business) is worth the gamble.Finally, Brody and Hooper charter an expedition with the enigmatic, vaguely malevolent Quint (Robert Shaw), Amity's most feared and respected shark hunter, to find and kill the shark and save the town from financial disaster. What ensues is an epic, archetypal man vs. beast quest that would make Herman Melville and Joseph Campbell proud. Our shark, it turns out, is way above average size, terrifically swift and powerful, and uncannily smart, to boot. Hooper, the scientist, is awestruck at having encountered the Bigfoot of the sea; Quint, the crafty fisherman with a serious chip on his shoulder against sharks, realizes he has met the ultimate test of his skills; Brody, who swims poorly and is afraid of water, must overcome abject fear and disorientation just to maintain his composure.Robert Shaw's Quint is one of the greatest anti-heroes the movies have ever seen. He is funny and frightening all at once, and the famous soliloquy in which he recalls the tragic sinking of the USS Indianapolis--where, over the course of a week waiting for rescue, at least 90 US Navy personnel died from shark attack wounds--is one of the most chilling and unforgettable performances ever committed to film.'Jaws' is the movie that made Steven Spielberg's career, and it's among his finest. It's easy to forget because of his enormously successful blockbusters that Spielberg is a phenomenally skillful and artful director. His timing is superb, he mixes horror with comedy to brilliant effect, he gets great performances out of his actors, and his love for special effects has never overwhelmed his understanding of the importance of story and character.That said, the most brilliant aspect of 'Jaws' was a serendipitous accident.The special effects team had yet to fully troubleshoot 'Bruce,' the mechanical shark, by the time filming was to begin. Under tight budget restraints and enormous studio pressure, Spielberg had no choice but to press on while his crew labored vainly to make the shark work in the cold and corrosive north Atlantic seawater. To compensate for the absence of the non-functional fake shark, Spielberg used shots from the shark's point of view and John Williams' famous two-note theme to create the illusion of the shark's presence in the early scenes. Fortunately the crew was ultimately able to get Bruce into operational status in time to film the big showdown, and some of the scenes are filled in with live-shark footage filmed by Australian underwater video pioneers Ron and Valerie Taylor. Consequently, the audience's fear is magnified by the fact that, for the majority of the film, they cannot see the shark, creating suspense towards the climax of the confrontation between man and beast on Quint's fishing boat.'Jaws' succeeds on almost every level. It is terrifying without being grotesque, and spectacular without being unbelievable (if the shark looks a little fake, remember that, at the time 'Jaws' was released, 'Space Invaders' was on the cutting edge of computer graphics design and there was no such thing as 'Shark Week on the Discovery Channel'). Roy Scheider's Brody is a quintessential everyman, an average guy beset by fear and guilt who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances and rises to the occasion. Dreyfuss' Hooper is brash and brave enough not to come off as nerdy or self-righteous, and his friendship with Brody becomes the backbone of the movie (Spielberg and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb wisely deviated from the novel in regards to the character of Hooper, who was originally Brody's nemesis). Robert Shaw's Quint is a modern-day Captain Ahab, a worthy foe for the malevolent shark. The suspense is potent and the action thrilling, but the humor, emotion, and character development make this movie much more than a summer blockbuster.",

I'm not talking about the Hollywood blockbuster, or the insane madness that sent thousands of misunderstood Great Whites to their deaths, I'm talking about the beginning of my interest in movies. This is the movie that did it. I couldn't tell you how old I was when I first saw it, but I do remember this is the movie I made my parents rent time and time again when we went to the video store. This is the movie that drove my parents and some of my friends nuts while I watched it day after day after day when my mom gave it to me for Christmas. This is the movie that made me want to turn a real interest in the movies from just a hobby and into a career. For that, I owe Spielberg, Benchley, Scheider, Shaw, Dreyfuss, Williams, Fields and everyone else a sincere and heart-felt thank you. I own this movie on every format in which it is available. I love it that much. I've probably seen it between 200 and 300 times. I guess you can say it is an obsession. A sick obsession. The plot, the pacing, the editing, the score, the acting, and, oh yes, the shark. Who cares that is fake? By the time we finally get to see it, do we care? Truly, a more suspenseful movie was never made. Several come close, but none quite reaches the primal level the JAWS does. No other film so effectively taps into our fear of the unknown, and then gives it a riveting score to boot. No other movie grips us so strongly with heart stopping suspense that we find ourselves nearly falling off our seats. And no other movie leaves us feeling so spent and wasted after a viewing. And the reason for all the fear, suspense and emotional withdrawal is not top-notch special effects. It was the mid-70's. You can barely apply top -notch to anything of that era. The reason the movie does all that to us is that it is a great story. It is filled with real people, who have real jobs, and who have real fears. And who must now confront a real shark. Can you think of anything more terrifying that getting on a rickety, leaky boat to kill a 25-foot shark when you already have a paralyzing fear of the water? I can't. And Martin Brody sure can't. And so, no matter what ranking JAWS may get on AFI's list of the 100 greatest movies, or TV Guides list of the top 50 movies, or any list for that matter, JAWS will always come in number one on mine. Steven, Peter, Roy, Robert, Richard, John, and Verna -- thank you. Not for just giving me a sense of direction in my life, not for just making me want to be a screenwriter, but also for making a movie that still thrills me as much now when I watch it as when it did when I saw it for the very first time.",

I'm questioning, because it seems like all the terrific horror films came out of the 70's.Jaws is based on the best seller book by Peter Benchley. Steven Spielberg, before he was STEVEN Spielberg turned this horrifying book and made it into a reason to hate sharks. He brilliantly took what could have been a cheesy movie and turned it into a classic that will never be forgotten. To this day, I still need a friend to hold onto, it's that score! Duh na... duh na.... dun dun dun dun.... Oh, my gosh, that music just scares the heck out of me! On such a low budget, Jaws not only turned into one of the greatest horror movies of all time, it turned into one of the greatest movies, period.Jaws starts off with one of the most terrifying scenes in horror movie cinema, a young pretty girl goes into the water and is brutally attacked and killed by an unknown creature in the water. The next day Chief Brody investigates suspecting a shark attack, and urges the mayor, Larry Vaughn, to shut down the beach, but afraid of a panic and less tourists, Larry ignores the chief's suggestions and keeps the beach open leading to another attack on a young boy. Brody calls in Matt Hooper, a marine scientist to see if they can find the shark. But when another attack ensues and almost kills Brody's young son, Michael, he, Matt, and a cocky man, Quint go out to find Jaws themselves.This turns into several of the greatest cinematic scenes of all time, like the \"Indianapolis\" speech brilliantly given by Quint, how he describes seeing his first shark was just so intense and you couldn't turn away from the screen. Then, one thing that is interesting about this movie, you do not see the shark until Brody is just chucking blood to attract the shark over his shoulder and Jaws appears roaring out of the water! \"We're gonna need a bigger boat!\" he replies to Quint. And then the scene where Jaws jumps onto the boat and Quint is trapped sliding into Jaw's, well, jaws! That's the scene that nightmares are made out of! Jaws is one of my favorite films of all time. It's one of those films that should never be missed, because it is so important. To many, including myself, the shark looks fake, but it's your imagination that gets with you. Spielberg embraced that and you could tell there was just something special about him. Jaws will scare you out of the water just like The Exorcist scared you to the church!10/10",

            "review": "Widely regarded as the film that began the \"summer movie blockbuster era\", JAWS (1975) was also rightfully one of the year's most critically acclaimed movies. It was also the recipient of an Academy Award Nomination for Best Picture and a winner of Oscars for film editing (Verna Fields) and music score (John Williams).  One of the reasons the film received no acting nods is that everyone involved is so good, how could one single out just one or two? (I personally feel Robert Shaw should have gotten a Best Actor nomination, however). Roy Scheider is wonderful as New York cop Martin Brody, who has relocated to a small coastal island town, only to have his bad case of \"aquaphobia\" put to the ultimate test. Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly cast as a shark expert and provides some truly funny comic bits along the way. Lorraine Gary (who director Steven Spielberg says was the first person to be cast for the film) does an excellent job of being the concerned wife and mother. Finally, there's Murray Hamilton, who gives one of the best performances of his career as Mayor Vaughn, who seems to be more concerned about the economy of the town than the safety of the residents. In a way, Vaughn is really the film's villain. Solid cast indeed. The screenplay (by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb) is tight and well-written, as is Spielberg's direction. Whether it was the mechanical shark's failure to operate correctly or Spielberg's decision to simply see less of the shark until the end of the film, the \"less is more\" idea works perfectly, particularly in the opening scene, which is chilling to this day.One thing I do want to add: if you choose to watch this film at home, do yourself a favor and rent or buy the WIDESCREEN version. The full-screen pan and scan version is a travesty that ruins the great camerawork that Spielberg and cameraman Bill Butler made. I always recommend the widescreen version but it is especially important for JAWS.No offense to fans of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, but this is the film that should have taken home the Oscar gold.

Spielberg magically turns the silly story into a tense exciting thriller with brilliant dialogue and classic scene's. Mark my words, \"Jaws\" is a movie that will never be considered outdated.Everything in the movie works so well! The acting, the dialogue, the tension, the typical Spielberg humor, the music, everything! It's hard to name just one thing why this movie is such a masterpiece. It is the mix of everything combined that makes the movie work. Probably my favorite thing about the movie would be the dialogue, they are very raw and performed well by the perfect cast. Another thing of course would be the music and I'm not just talking about the main theme but about the entire musical score in general.The cast is great but they are mainly great together. All of the Scheider/Shaw/Dreyfuss scene's are like three ingredients thrown together and the end result of it is pure gold.And than Bruce the shark. Yes, he really looks believable even now days.A real classic masterpiece that launched Spielberg's career10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "review": "Reputationally-speaking, \"Jaws\" will forever be known for two things: director Steven Spielberg's unique \"shark-eye view\" camera work and building of suspense, and composer John Williams' two note \"attack\" motif that became as iconic as any piece of music ever created. Perhaps those two aspects alone would have been enough to make \"Jaws\" an iconic film--who knows. But the fact is, this 1975 effort is about so much more than just suspense/horror. It is one of the most well-rounded, complete movies ever made.For a very basic overview, \"Jaws\" tells the story of the coastal town of Amity, which suddenly and inexplicably becomes the hunting grounds for a rogue Great White shark. Sheriff Brody (Roy Scheider) wants to close down the beaches until further notice, but is opposed every step of the way by city official Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), who worries about the potential loss of tourist business. When the attacks continue, however, Brody enlists the help of shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and grizzled boatsman Quint (Robert Shaw) to help hunt down the giant predator.As stated, the general premise and music here are well-known. But what always strikes me with each \"Jaws\" re-watch is how much it is a human drama as opposed to a horror piece driven by a villain (the shark, in this case).The first half of \"Jaws\" takes place almost entirely \"on land\", if you will, and focuses more on the politics of fear and commerce than anything supernatural or scary. If there are ever any doubts as to whether that material holds up, they can easily be put to rest after viewing the film through a pandemic context. Substitute \"global contagious disease\" for \"mindless, unstoppable shark\" and it's as relevant today as ever.The second half leans more towards \"adventure sea chase\", and is buoyed by ocean scenes that, despite being filmed 45+ years ago now, do not seen old or outdated in the least. Masterful cinematography almost always holds up, and Spielberg's behind-the-camera decisions certainly do here as well. Even then though, in the midst of a brutal and thrilling chase, Spielberg stops the action for a touching scene in which the three seaman bond over song and shared experiences.In order to fully exhibit such depth of character, great acting is required--and given here in spades. \"Jaws\" features a collection of unique characters that are always a joy to revisit. Scheider as the \"why-won't- anyone-listen-to-me!\" sheriff lets viewers relate to the story in a much more personal aspect, while Dreyfuss' Hooper is insightful, hilarious, and provides some of the best dialogue of the whole show. Of course, Shaw as Quint is singularly iconic, juxtaposing jocularity and complexity perfectly within his single character.Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give \"Jaws\" is that every time I see it, I can't help but be swept away in all its winning aspects. Whether it be the drama, emotion, music, thrills, adventure, visuals, acting, or just overall heart of the piece, there is not a single scene wasted or underutilized. I have absolutely no doubt that it will remain just as visceral of an experience going forward as it was for those sitting in the theaters in 1975.",

My daughter (whom is 17) and I were both stunned at the quality and realism of a film made in 1975!! Our TV is 55 inches which showed the movie off to it's full potential and it certainly did not disappoint.That iconic moment of the young lady going skinny dipping in the dark with her male friend is utterly haunting. You know the horror of what's going to happen, the buoy dinging in the background gives you the chills. Steven Spielberg captures pure terror in that scene.Jaws completely absorbs you, as the trio of shark hunters venture off to try to snare the great white you begin to feel part of their adventure. You fear for them, get excited with them and dread what will happen next. When that fishing line starts spinning your heart starts pumping. This is pure class.The dynamics of Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw's relationship(s) work brilliantly. The differences in their characters persona's is such that they rub each other up the wrong way, disrespect one another and wind each other up but in the end they are there for each other and develop a bond that I think surprises them all.As things begin to unravel your heart goes out to the trio and trepidation is the only way forward. They have the fight of their life on their hands, their bravery is boundless. You feel in awe of them.An absolute legend of a movie which I am grateful to have been able to watch and enjoy.",

Steven Spielberg had made himself the most successful director of all time when he went all out with this one! Running to the back of the house and turning all the lights on were just a few things I resorted to after watching the opening for the first time!!! I Never watched anymore of it until 1-3 years later. I was highly hesitant because to a young child, a skinny dippers suffering to the wrath of the giant unknown mouth was the most horrifying sequence in film history at the time...and it still is now! Once I finally got the courage to view the film, I was still in for a lot of surprises. The cinematography is superb in its ruthless attempt to bring the audience to the depths of a powerful ocean, and to the eyes of the dark, wretched creature the inhabits it. The story of the killer shark attacking the unfortunate island in the world is more than scary. It could have been any place in the world, and it had to be Amitty Island. The shark could have easily lost it's way in the swaying currents of the ocean, but as the opposite inhabitants of the beach get angry, this big mother is here to stay! The technique is wild, absolutely wild, and John Williams score earned more than an Oscar for it! Creepy piano notes enter this films titles, and the blue depths of the uncharted territory beneath the sea let us all know that no sense, however small, was to be spared. The first victim, alone will haunt those who view it for the rest of their days, and the rest of the story is more like a battle. This strange battle is often more focused on understanding the other side. What Brody, Quint, and Hooper must do is plunge into the depths themselves, and seek out the unruly monster of the sea. The common theme in this terrific classic is survival, and why not? Survival is a natural instinct to all animal alike. The shark must survive, as it makes so clear by snagging unsuspecting swimmers, but also the people, they to have to survive, but the island is not big enough for both man and fish together. Always a joy to experience over and over again, this film is the ultimate scare show to end them all! Sometimes, a lot of us fans can not seem to get enough of this instant classic!",

Yet before the Dinosaurs, Holocaust, Peter Pan, UFO's, and Indy there was the Shark. Jaws represents one of the masterpieces on Spielbergs resume. It is also probably the \"Quintessential Spielberg Film.\"Jaws was very popular when released, it was the gighest grossing film of 1975. It spawned three sequels, which were all inferior. In fact, no film about Sharks or any killer fish has been able to come close to the level of Jaws.The genius in Jaws is its ability to build suspense. The Shark is never really shown till near the end of the film. When ever the Shark is approaching its victims, we get the Sharks point of view, instead of seeing the Shark. These POV shots combined with John Williams very effective score, make the scenes when the Shark is about to devour his victims much more effective.Evry actor does a nice job with their performances. Roy Scheider brings Martin to life. Martin is not a showy character but Scheider is able to make us like him. Richard Dreyfuss exhibits energy in his performance as Matt Hooper. Robert Shaw is very effective as Quint, that Indiannapolis speech is still very chilling to me. Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton also give solid support.People always talk about how fake the Shark looks. I think its passable but today it would definitely be done by CGI. However, the Shark is not seen that much in the film so its not that big of a deal.I would like to say Jaws is Spielbergs best film, Schindlers List closely follows. But I would like to see Close Encouners and the Indiana Jones films again. I did not like Close Encounters the first time, and I like the Indiana Jones films but they never stood out to me. If these films dont surpass Jaws, then it is definitely Spielberg's best film.",

Adapted from Willy Vlautin's novel, the film plunges viewers into a high-stakes, emotionally raw quest as Lynette (Vanessa Kirby) races against the clock to secure her family's future in a rapidly gentrifying Portland. What I loved about this movie was its tense, ticking-clock atmosphere and urgent pacing; every frame brims with suspense and desperation as Lynette scrambles overnight to raise $25,000, making tough choices and confronting her past. The story beautifully balances grit and empathy, adding layers to its social commentary about housing insecurity and class struggles.The cast is simply phenomenal. Jennifer Jason Leigh delivers a quietly devastating turn as Lynette's unreliable mother, Doreen, showing a complexity that deepens every family scene. Zack Gottsagen is moving as Kenny, Lynette's brother, whose innocence amplifies the stakes and heartbreak, and together, their performances ground the story in vulnerability and hope. But the reason I was truly captivated is Vanessa Kirby. She dominates the screen and brings such emotional urgency, versatility, and empathy to Lynette that I couldn't look away. Kirby channels every stage of desperation, pain, and resolve with a haunting depth; she's the beating heart of the film, making every moment memorable. The chemistry among these three, especially Kirby's dynamic with Gottsagen and Leigh, represents the best of ensemble acting, elevating a tense genre drama into a resonant journey about family and survival.It is a deep dark social commentary centered on one woman's struggle to survive and rise above. It is not pretty, it is not a Hallmark movie, It is realism, sadness and desperation at it's raw core and yet it is the triumph of survival and the eternal hope of a better life.",

            "review": "Movies based on books are always a challenge because they can veer into irrelevance. This time, we have a movie featuring a desperate protagonist, a victim, about to suffer a major setback. She faces the need to fight to keep what she has, guarantee her future, and have a dignified life. But in this scenario, which we can describe as uncreative or novel, many excellent opportunities are wasted when they could actually enrich the work.There is a promising background that supports and sustains the movie. The protagonist suffers immensely, living in an unbalanced, dangerous, even deadly situation, assuming the legitimate role of victim of a cruel system. Of course, the system is cruel because not everyone enjoys satisfactory financial conditions, and the results are disastrous. But the causes of this situation are not addressed. This leads to the uncomfortable fact that the movie refuses to criticize the system, as if it were natural. Thus, the background that drives the protagonist's decadent journey is undermined, largely due to an incredible lack of creativity.The conflicts are overly inflated and reach a narrow dead end, becoming diluted and losing solidity throughout the story. Thus, it's clear that the movie has a valid premise, but it's shallow, clueless, and poorly written. In other words, the unjust system that afflicts the protagonist is essentially impersonal, random, and, most dramatically, irreversible. Everything revolves around the protagonist's suffering. This is what drives the story, summarized in less than 24 hours. The Night Always Comes is, therefore, shallow. At best, and if generosity is appropriate here, it's dispensable.",

It's just one big revenge story and that again ties into the predictability aspect, after about 25 minutes most people should be able to guess what happens the rest of the way.It's a good theater flick, it's entertaining, but it's not worthy of a high rating due to its tunnel vision plot and lackluster depth.",

Originally, the thing I was most excited about before seeing this was to see John Wick again, but it turns out that even if he weren't in the film, the movie still would've ended up being as good as it is. The scenes with John Wick were amazing, but every scene that didn't include him was equally as good. I liked Eve's character more than I expected to, and even though he wasn't in the movie that much, I did enjoy the scenes with Norman Reedus as Daniel Pine. The amount of action sequences in this movie is insane, mostly every second of this movie, we get more and more action without being able to take a breather. This might just be the most action-packed movie of the franchise yet, right next to John Wick: Chapter 4. Overall, Ballerina is exactly everything you could ever want from a John Wick spinoff.

But Ballerina does something slick - it leans hard into Eve (Ana de Armas' character) and redefines what it means to fight like a girl. Spoiler: it doesn't mean holding back.While John Wick is a surgeon with a gun - all headshots, no wasted motion, like he's got a built-in aimbot - Eve dances to a different beat. Her combat style is scrappier, grittier, and gloriously unconventional. Remember the advice she gets early on? Fight like a girl. And trust, Eve took that to heart - but not the way you'd think. She weaponizes unpredictability: grenades, fire, fists - no kill looks the same. It's a brutal ballet, and she's the prima.The action is top-tier - you'll get your gun-fu fix - but Ballerina also sneaks in a solid story, giving Eve space to be more than just a shooter. Plus, without spoiling too much, we get a cameo from a certain dog-loving assassin that keeps the Wickiverse connective tissue strong - the kind of storytelling Marvel wishes it could still pull off.If you're an action junkie, do yourself a favor: catch this in D-Box. You'll be dodging bullets in your seat, vibing with every explosion.Final verdict: 4 out of 5 stars. Ballerina doesn't just hit - it dances circles around your expectations.",

And this one deliver ! It brings the classic Gunfu we love and add some new amazing elements that had not been done before. By the 5th movie in the franchise, its pretty cool to be able to do so.Yes Eve is a little small to fully portray that killing machine standard we got used to by this universe, but this is where suspending your disbeliefs get into place. I enjoyed that she also take a beating herself in many instances and don't come out scratch free of every fights.This movie introduce a new \"faction\" to the John Wick Universe, wich it keep a little vague for now (wich is fine, they can always expand in the sequels) while also expanding the lore about the Ruska Roma.Now is Eve as charismatic and \"epic\" as John himself? I would say not quite, but the movie aknowledge that itself. Its a new character and Ana gave her 100% to it and i am sure they will make many more of these in futur years. And bet i will be there to watch them.Definately will be adding this one next to my other Wick movies on my shelves.Oh i almost forgot. Funny enough Daniel Bernhardt who played the main henchman in John Wick 1 is also in this movie as a new character.

This wasn't believable or realistic. Similarly, our main character is too emotional to be a death angel.The grenade scenes were over-the-top and even absurd, but the flamethrower scene was the most entertaining.The duration of John Wick's scenes may exceed your expectations, but that's a good thing, It was nice to see him.In summary, if you've watched and enjoyed the John Wick movies, you should watch Ballerina.

It starts with the young \"Eve\" (Victoria Comte) who witnesses her father's death at the hands of \"The Chancellor\" (Gabriel Byrne) before being adopted into the secret society of \"John Wick\" by \"Winston\" (Ian McShane) and his drag-like boss (Angelica Huston) where she learns to combine the artistic skills of a ballerina with deadly ninja ones - as she morphs into Ana de Armas (whilst everyone else remains exactly the same). Anyway, none of that really matters as she accidentally discovers the identity of the tribe who ruined her life and despite warnings of dire consequences, sets off on a lethal mission of retribution that takes her to a Czech Republic where everyone speaks perfect English. The thing is, it appears that her gang and the one she is pursuing have a sort of unwritten truce, and given she is about to throw that under the Skoda, Angelica has no choice other than to bring out of retirement the legendary you know who. Will that make anything any different or safer or even less repetitive? It not so much that this is derivative and really quite dull, it's that the dialogue is woeful and the constant frying pan to fire scenarios where people get used and abused are ridiculous. Knives, guns, bottles, pots, pans, kettles - even a pair of ruthlessly applied roller skates and some flamer throwers help our heroine along but it's hilarious that they always appear just when she needs them. She's got the points and gone up a level, She also heals as if she were the sister of \"Wolverine\" and no amount of training is going to remove a six inch shard of glass from your body without it impeding your ability to scale a wall and wield a pick axe. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood, but just like the series upon which this is based, it is unoriginal and after the umpteenth time she has survived against innumerable odds to fight again just had me wondering how long until she's back with \"Ballerina II - the Pirouette\".

Over the last few years, John has organically steered towards geopolitical stories and characters that aren't just another spy or part of a covert agency.In 'Tehran', John's character, Rajeev Kumar, gets involved in a very complicated case when a bomb blast in Delhi targeting an Israeli diplomat kills an innocent flower-seller. The incident disturbs Rajeev Kumar to such an extent that he decides to put his life at stake to get to the bottom of the matter.Set against the backdrop of the Iran-Israel conflict, the film examines how ordinary people become collateral damage in someone else's war. Unlike many thrillers in the genre, 'Tehran' doesn't exploit the premise; instead, it sensitively shows every possible facet of the price one has to pay to wage a war.The screenplay by Bindni Karia, co-written with Ritesh Shah and Ashish Prakash Verma, is the film's strongest asset. Dialogues peppered with Farsi lend authenticity, while director Arun Gopalan draws solid performances from his cast. Neeru Bajwa and Manushi Chhillar make their mark in supporting roles. But, 'Tehran' works because of the conviction that John puts into his role. One of his finest performances till date, the film is a testament that, with a good script and a visionary director, all an actor needs to do is just surrender and keep faith.A standout is Hadi Khajanpour as antagonist Asraf Khan, who is an absolutely brilliant find. He is not just menacing for the sake of it, but also a sharply etched, powerful character.The way the film has been shot visually is also impressive. From the dusty lanes of Delhi to Abu Dhabi, the camerawork is brilliant. The action sequences feel very organic and real, with combat scenes that are gritty and extremely tense.Tehran is a masterclass on how to deliver Deshbhakti without lehraa-oing Tiranga or chanting Jai Hind on the Independence Day! It celebrates the unsung heroes, who are mostly abandoned by their countries for being on missions that are either off-paper or not approved at all!Whenever John Abraham is an alone man on a mission, he comes out with a brilliant result-be it Madras Cafe or Tehran. With its intelligent script, the film becomes an absolute must-watch for anyone who appreciates quality storytelling and has the patience to research on international relationships and politics before diving into the film.",

            "review": "Tells us how not to make and distribute a movie... John Abraham's presence is the only solace. All other actors (if we can call them so) are just wandering here and there without any decent character building. There is no storyline at all. One villian is identified in the beginning and then the entire 2+ hours are wasted in catching him. By the way he cannot act...can only make funny faces every time he appears. Looks like many scenes were shot here and there and then joined one after the other without much coherence on the editing table. Even John Abraham looks clueless and doesn't know why he is there. Maybe he understood after shooting a couple of scenes what a mess of a script he has gotten himself into. Gunfight scenes seem over the top and in most cases not required. Scenes involving diplomats and back channel discussions involving different agencies seem to have been shot just for the sake of having some scenes with diplomats wining and dining; they are without much depth and substance.Also, I believe the makers chose zee5 as a poor choice to release. The platform lacks technology for good streaming experience. Maybe primevideo and netflix backed out after reading their script.If you are not a John Abraham fan, you can simply skip this one. If you are his fan, then you must skip this one so that you remain his fan.",

Anchored by a brilliant lead performance, the film shuns needless glamour and exaggerated \"masala\" elements often found in blockbusters. Instead, it presents a raw, compelling narrative that grips you from the first frame.Set against the backdrop of the 2012 Delhi bombing, the story follows officer RK on his tense, relentless quest for truth after being betrayed by both India and Iran. The plot is tight, layered, and refreshingly free from overused tropes, focusing on real stakes and complex moral conflicts.What truly impresses is the film's ability to build suspense not through flashy action, but through atmosphere, emotion, and character-driven storytelling. The performances are understated yet powerful, making every moment feel believable. The direction and cinematography further enhance the gritty tone, placing viewers right in the heart of the action.Compared to other blockbuster spy movies, \"Tehran\" is a breath of fresh air. It redefines the genre with its raw aesthetic, smart writing, and commitment to authenticity. For those seeking a genuinely gripping spy drama without the excess, \"Tehran\" is highly recommended.",

            "review": "Arun Gopalan's espionage thriller carries a distinct urgency, fueled by a charged political backdrop and anchored by a commanding lead performance from John Abraham. The film crafts a tense atmosphere that blends realism with cinematic flair, leaning into the paranoia and claustrophobia of covert operations. Much of the impact stems from its cinematography, which favors tight framing and sharp contrasts to heighten unease, often shifting between shadow-heavy interiors and wide, almost desolate exteriors of Tehran. This visual design underscores the sense of isolation at the heart of the narrative, giving the film a stylistic edge even when the storytelling takes familiar turns.Abraham delivers one of his stronger recent performances, balancing physical presence with moments of emotional vulnerability that ground the high-concept stakes. Manushi Chhillar proves effective as more than a supporting figure, demonstrating nuance in a role that resists being reduced to a stock character. Meanwhile, Hadi Khanjanpour injects gravitas into the film's antagonistic thread, lending complexity to an otherwise rigid political conflict.The pacing occasionally struggles, particularly in its midsection, where momentum dips under the weight of repeated strategic maneuvers. Yet the screenplay recovers with set pieces that feel immediate and dangerous, marked by handheld camerawork and stripped-down sound design that amplify tension. The score, though conventional, supports rather than overwhelms, leaving space for the actors and visuals to carry the drama.While not revolutionary within the genre, the film benefits from its ability to balance action-driven sequences with moments of moral reckoning, refusing to paint its characters in absolute shades of black and white. At its best, it captures the suffocating uncertainty of a man trapped between hostile forces and abandoned loyalties. A compelling if uneven spy drama, it earns its place as a solid entry in the canon of politically tinged thrillers.",

From start to finish, it reeks of laziness, incompetence, and an absolute lack of respect for the audience. The writing is beyond awful-whoever penned this script should reconsider their career. It's full of the most predictable, uninspired dialogue imaginable, with characters so lifeless they make mannequins look expressive.The pacing is a disaster. Scenes drag on with no tension, no purpose, just empty filler designed to stretch the runtime rather than tell a compelling story. It's like they had one decent idea-an evil monkey-and stretched it so thin it completely disintegrates. There's no depth, no complexity, just a mind-numbing sequence of events that fail to build anything meaningful.The horror? Nonexistent. It relies on the cheapest jump scares possible, the kind that aren't scary so much as obnoxiously loud. Not once does it create actual suspense or psychological unease-it just throws noise at you and expects you to be impressed. The direction is soulless, the cinematography bland, and the vibe/humor so depressing that it's almost laughable.But what really pisses me off is how obviously low-effort it all feels. There's no passion, no creativity, no reason for this movie to exist other than to cash in on people's love for Stephen King's name. They didn't care about making something memorable or interesting, just about pumping out another piece of disposable content to clutter streaming services.I can't imagine anyone with a shred of taste sitting through this and thinking it's remotely acceptable.

And yeah, the premise is silly: A monkey bangs a drum-someone dies. But instead of a serious horror film, you get an over-the-top horror-comedy that tries so hard to be funny that it eventually gets in its own way.The movie actually starts off well. The first deaths still have some shock value, the characters are entertaining, and there's a bit of that Final Destination appeal where you're curious about what's going to happen next. But very quickly, you realize: there's no real tension. Every death is just a setup for a joke. The first time it's funny, the second time too-but by the eighth time someone randomly explodes and the others just shrug it off with an \"eww,\" it gets old.And that's the problem. The film mocks horror clichés but doesn't offer anything thrilling itself. Scream proved that you can perfectly blend horror and comedy by keeping both elements grounded enough. Here, every serious moment is immediately undercut by a dumb joke. Even themes like the strained father-son relationship or the threat of the monkey carry zero weight because nothing in the movie has real consequences.The second half starts to drag. The jokes repeat, and at some point, the film just feels like a series of TikTok skits where people die in the most absurd ways possible. The ending is the lowest point. I won't spoil it, but it feels like the writers had no idea how to wrap things up-so they went with the cheapest and dumbest option.Is it a bad movie? No. It's entertaining if you just want to turn off your brain and enjoy some absurdity. But it could have been so much more if it had taken itself even a little bit seriously.

I love the idea of the totem object that could possibly be a deity or god of some sort and how it follows the brothers into adulthood.What I was sold was not what I got. I would say it compares to the use of the monkey drum toy for the poster of the film Monkey Shines (1988) by George A. Romero. Which is to say - they have nothing to do with each other - one is used to sell the other - and it's misleading. I blame the trailers. The Monkey - in terms of a film - is closer to a real bloody version of The Cable Guy (1996) or Very Bad Things (1998). If you go into the film expecting the tense horror/suspense of Longlegs, you'll end up a sad monkey.As I walked away from the film I think I would have really enjoyed it if it was marketed more as a dark comedy (and sure some of this blame is on me as a viewer to do my research). As it stands - if you've seen the trailers you've already seen 90% of the suspense in the film. What you haven't seen is the absolute mayhem and chaos that surrounds those situations. I think the first 10 minutes of the film tells you exactly what it is - how the humor works - and how it plays out through the monkey.If you're on board with the opening - it's a perfect roller coaster. My problem was that I thought I was on a rollercoaster and instead ended up tripping on a bunch of banana peels.

I figured I'd give Perkins another chance to impress me; given that I enjoy most films based on King's work, I thought I would have a better time with this one. I have to say that while The Monkey isn't as unfathomable or as dull as Longlegs, I was more disappointed by it since I actually had my hopes up.I can't remember too much about the original story -- it's been a while since I read it -- but Perkins has clearly done some serious expanding on the tale, and let me tell you... he is no King. His script for The Monkey is light on genuine horror, leaning heavily into the comedy, but I guess that me and Perkins just aren't on the same page when it comes to what is funny. The majority of laughs are intended to come from the ridiculous Final Destination-style death scenes; I love OTT gore, but found the film's cartoonish Rube Goldbergian demises predictable (too much was shown in the trailer) and dumb, with CGI that looked horribly dated.

Horror comedies are tough to pull off, but this film manages to create an odd yet satisfying balance between gory chaos and weirdly charming absurdity. You're not exactly belly-laughing, but there's this strange, undeniable urge to smirk and chuckle at the madness on screen. It has the energy of a violent children's fairy tale. Think of a silent-era slapstick comedy, but with splattering blood and twisted fates. It's bizarre, but it works.Now, let's talk about what horror fans are really here for; the kills. And The Monkey delivers. It's gruesome, creative, and wacky in the best way possible. The deaths feel like something conjured from a child's chaotic imagination; illogical yet strangely poetic. The Monkey itself, this cursed toy at the center of the carnage, has a mischievous, almost gleeful way of orchestrating its victims' fates. If you love the elaborate, almost Rube Goldberg-esque deaths of Final Destination, you're in for a treat. It's all so over-the-top that it somehow becomes hilarious. The violence is exaggerated, stylized, and so absurd that it loops back around to being entertaining rather than just shocking.Then there's Theo James, the ever-dashing star who's given the impossible task of playing an insecure, jittery father. And let's be honest; this man is too effortlessly suave for that. No amount of nerdy costuming can fully strip away his natural charm, and while he gives it his best shot, it's hard to fully buy into his transformation. He does a decent job, but there's a lingering sense that he's slightly miscast.As for the story, it's simple... maybe too simple. The Monkey doesn't aim for deep narratives or complex character arcs. It moves along swiftly, focusing more on its chaotic spectacle than its plot. But credit where it's due: the film isn't just a copy-paste horror template. Unlike Wish Upon, which follows a predictable formula, The Monkey throws in enough surprises to keep things fresh.That is, until the third act. This is where the film goes off the rails, not necessarily in a bad way, but in a 'Did we just jump the shark?' kind of way. It tries to up the stakes but ends up pushing the absurdity a bit too far. The motivation behind certain character decisions feels weak, and it loses some of the controlled chaos that made the first two acts so enjoyable.Still, despite its flaws, The Monkey is a damn good time. The suspense is solid, the kills are outrageous, and the execution of horror-comedy is commendable. Could it have been better? Sure. A slower, more tension-filled buildup to the deaths would've elevated it further. But as it stands, it's an undeniably fun horror flick that doesn't take itself too seriously.Verdict: The Monkey is a wild, ridiculous, and gory thrill ride that embraces its absurdity in the best way possible. It's like eating a sour candy; sharp, intense, but with a strangely enjoyable sweetness underneath. While Theo James struggles to shed his natural charisma for his role, and the third act goes a little off the deep end, the film remains a thoroughly fun and entertaining horror experience. If you love blood, chaos, and dark humor, you'll have a blast with this one.",

            "review": "Evil-looking windup toy monkey causes someone's gory \"accidental\" death every time it beats its toy drum. That's it, for an hour and a half. Every ten minutes somebody dies in an elaborate fashion that nonetheless lacks the ingenuity or suspense of the \"Final Destination\" (or even \"Saw\") movies because it's all played as a joke. Even that would be fine if the director really had a flair for jaunty black comedy--something like early Coen brothers--or spectacular bad-taste slapstick. But he doesn't, so this just comes off as one dumb gag after another, played out by characters who are all cartoonishly one-dimensional, so there's zero emotional stake in their fates.I enjoyed at least some of Perkins' prior movies, but this reminded me that the weakest thing about Stephen King books and writing is when they're trying to be funny (think \"Maximum Overdrive\"), which is not his strong suit. It's better crafted than a lot of low-budget movies in a similar vein, but given that it's not particularly low-budget and involves some talented people, its ideas should be better than that of your average lowbrow gore comedy. I was very disappointed. If my expectations had been lower, I would have found it an okay throwaway movie--but even so, one that's neither particularly clever or scary, just sort of mildly amusing.",

We turned down the lights, poured ourselves a glass and got underneath our blankets for what was sure to be a fright fest!Okay so the first hour or so went by slowly. Scratch that it went by REALLY freaking slowly.All of a sudden there is movement beneath the blankets....a tentative head emerges. \" Umm do you think something is going to happen soon?\" She asks me.\"Sure\" I said. \"It didn't do too badly on IMDb right?! What was it? 6/10? Something has got to happen soon. Just watch it\".I'm not going to lie...there were points in the remaining hour of the movie where I seriously considered walking over to the corner of my kitchen and banging my head silently against the cold brick wall. Just for some kind of mental stimulation.Alas, we perservered and reached a point where there is a reveal of sorts between the characters. Lyndsey and I sat bolt upright and she reached over...clutching my hand.She looked at me. Eyes shining brightly with hope and anticipation. \"This is it, she breathed...something is finally happening....\"We turn back to the TV , clutching each other, barely daring to breath.Surely these last 2 hours of slow, monotonous, the monkey nonsense will be worth it....Surely the respected, intelligent members of IMDb wouldn't give an average but respectable score of 6.6 to a this trash?The credits roll and we sit back.

            "review": "This film relies completely on shock humour and gore, both of which become stale within the first 10 minutes.The tone is something akin to a children's tv programme, with all the characters acting as a cartoon would. The script gives no depth to the characters- with the way they react to traumatic events within the being completely unrelatable.The jokes are equally immature, using swear words or cuts to a gory effect as the punchline to a tense moment.This glut of irony is a mismatch with the horror genre in my opinion, particularly as it is repeated ad nauseum. Any mystery left within the film is stripped by this need for a quick gag.What takes this film to being a 1/10 is the addition of the most on-the-nose moralising about life. The trite faux-sophistication in the film's message of 'life is meaningless, let's go dancing' should be insulting to anyone who isn't a teenager. Characters in the film state this message explicitly, several times, in order to reduce any chance of subtlety.This film may entertain a milennial American with a thirst for gore and naughty words, but anyone else will find this a tedious piece of work.",

However, the most I can say about it is that it was good, not the best but still good. In my opinion it left many questions I had unanswered but still made me optimistic for a sequel. This films use of gore and shocking deaths was very enjoyable, however as the film went on it lost some of that gory, disturbing and almost haunting effect that it had on me to begin with. In a way the deaths and the film as a whole towards the later half became almost comedic and got many laughs from the audience aswell as me. Overall this film could be classed as a comedy horror. The first half was brilliant it set up a good background to the children and the monkey itself, it created this anxiety in me that I was about to be horrified. But as I have already said around the halfway mark the deaths became funny, it made me feel safe in a way and it wasn't this disturbingly terrific horror film that I was prepared to watch.In conclusion the monkey was a good film, osgood perking is a great director and I can't wait to see more from him. However this recent gore filled journey of his left me wanting more from the movie itself, which I hope can be satisfied if a sequel gets green lit.",

After buying it, the years pass and the brothers drift apart, the monkey however returns.I was genuinely looking forward to it, the cast on paper impressed me and the trailer looked great. The final result is a little bit of a disappointment, it aims to be an edgy, black comedy horror, most of the time it's just underwhelming.There's nothing new here, everything done here has been done before, better, in terms of pacing it is too slow, it takes ages to get going. I'm not too sure it knew what it wanted to be, I couldn't take it seriously as a horror, I wasn't expecting to yawn my wah through.On the plus side, the monkey looks awesome, I love the look on its face, especially when the lighting is dark and subtle, plus the period details are great, the early scenes look spot on. One or two of the scares looked good, very Final Destination at times.Fair to say all of the best material was crammed into the trailer, most of the material just wasn't up to much. They certainly made a great trailer, sadly they exhausted all of the best bits.Theo James does a good job, he adds a bit of life into the part and is as handsome as ever, sadly some of the other performances are a little lifeless.Overall, it's somewhat disappointing.6/10.",

I thought the representation of Amber's grief and the lesson of balancing that with the good was powerful, and they went about it without trying to dismiss or \"fix\" her in the end (as can be surmised from the previews that that's the direction it would go). From an adult perspective I thought it was great.But as it were, I took my 5 and 8 year old, and deeply regretted not looking to the reviews further before seeing it, thinking I could blindly trust an Angel Studios movie to have a PG movie actually be appropriate for little kids. (I was originally not going to take the 5 year old, but we ended up having a spot to fill last minute) So the lower rating is because the misrepresentation is quite problematic.As many reviews have said, it had such a strong horror movie tone to it, dappled with the lighthearted moments seen in the previews. There were definitely some laugh-out-loud funny parts, but much of it had even my 8 year old freaked out and hiding behind covered eyes. I think he'll be alright, in the end he said he liked it, but it's not the sort of experience I want for my kids.To me though the worse part was the unexpectedly frequent swearing. We have been really diligent about that and my kids came away with some new words they haven't heard before. Which really wouldn't be so bad if they didn't relentlessly repeat everything they hear. Not the sort of thing I'd have expected to experience from this studio, so I was really disappointed with that.Basically, this is just a warning to parents with small kids to always do your homework and make the effort to check content before seeing a movie, despite what studio it's from.",

There's a lot going for it; I saw this movie at TIFF and the announcer mentioned that director Seth Worley has a background in VFX - it shows.This movie - the fourth such imaginary creatures come to life movie in 2024, weird ain't it - has some truly impressive CG creations. The movie may be low budget, but the art style of these creatures lends itself well to simple creations. They have texture and make sense in the context of the story, and are undoubtedly the best part of the movie.Tony Hale is also really good in this, it's nice to see him in a leading man role and I think he plays this character - a grieving single father - quite well. He seems to be the most balanced character, despite film's characteristically snarky script Hale gets a lot of great sentimental moments.The movie also has a good message and manages to tie itself up quite neatly and in a way I think all good family films should. It explores complicated emotions pretty well. It's a movie unafraid to get creepy at times and really reminds of how family films used to be; often tinged with darkness, because ultimately, life isn't all sunshine and rainbows.I think what bothered me most about this movie was the script. It's a funny movie, yes, but you know when someone just can't tone it down and keeps cracking jokes, to the point where it's exhausting? I feel like Sketch has that problem. There are also A LOT of \"wait, did you just say ____,\" jokes that occur WELL INTO the final act that I just found tiring after a while.The movie also has kids. A lot of them. Two of them, the main boy and girl, are fine. They still can't help the movie's overly \"MCU\" tendencies of winking and joking at every opportunity. But there's one kid - Bowman - who gets WAY too much screen time and I find super obnoxious by the end of the movie. I'm sorry - he's not a great actor and he doesn't know how to interact with the CG creatures. There's a scene where he's supposed to be covered in them where it's evident he doesn't really know what he's looking at and it's super distracting.There was also a noticeable issue with the sound; too loud and too quiet at times. Maybe it was my theatre, but I suspect it was the mixing. I feel like the movie's score was honestly pretty bad; it never really captured the tone it was supposed to go for and reminded me more of Evil Dead Rise than anything...which just didn't fit.Overall, this is a fun movie, and it really reminded me of family adventure films from the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s.

One of the biggest points of this movie is when the brother says you're not a bad or evil person just because you drew an bad monster.

They need to know that it is okay for them to be angry upset or sad. They need to be reassured that it's normal if somebody makes you mad sometimes you want to smack them (that's normal even as adults we do the same thing don't lie when somebody makes you mad in your mind you're setting there thinking dang I really wish I could smack this person) it's a normal response.

            "review": "... And thats what movies are for.Firstly, for those who do not know, this was filmed during lockdowns which may have had an impact on the quality in general and how the film was shot.Secondly IMDB is wrong, its 90 mins not almost 2 and a half hours, but maybe the length got cut due to lockdowns, I have no idea.Thirdly (tertiary), I wont go into other reviews too much as no opinion is wrong, all such media is subjective but having said that, reviews giving one or two out of ten I feel are not being objectively honest.Now the film, no spoilers.This is very loosely an H. G Wells reimagined modern day telling of the story from mostly one persons perspective, it relies almost 100 percent on the use of the internet, teams video calls as the medium to tell the story, obviously this originally aired via the radio which was the medium of the day and I felt that this modern day telling was relatively accurate to how I would imagine this would go down today.It does help if you have at least a basic understanding of how the above mentioned forms of software are now being widely used to communicate with each other, and if you have not had any access to video calls and the internet in general, I can see how this would be hard to follow as other reviewers have stated.The effects of the film are clearly rather low budget but they tell the story adequately, just dont expect blockbuster style effects.The script, is in places a let down. The story itself is very rushed in places, for example, the main character drastically changes his life's views and opinion in a couple of seconds which is simply not believable and a little cringe.A couple of switches in the narrative of the movie also stand out as a \"Really????\" moment.Having said all of this, I went to start watching as I saw the first several reviews giving a 1 or 2 out of ten, calling it the worst film ever and I honestly was expecting to turn it off after 10 minutes once my urge to see just how bad it can be was scratched.I watched the while film, and I was honestly entertained.If you are ok with somewhat basic rushed and a little cheesy script and effects that really do look like mediocre CGI at best, the story and the new take on this old troupe was enjoyable.This will win no awards, but it was different, I liked it, I am glad it was made and that I watched it and decided to write this review to counter the rather harsh one and two star reviews.For me its a 5 to 6 out of ten, I should point out I am quite a harsh scorer, almost every film I have seen, I rate one star lower than IMDB does.Give it 20 minutes, if you dont like, dont carry on.",

In some respects it does keep the audience on edge with the interest of \"just how bad can this get from here?\" and this is the one area where the movie does NOT let you down.The best irony is that this installment is titled \"Revival\", which would lead you to believe that there is a return to stature or something, but this edition does nothing more than leave you with the feeling that it should have been left alone and Cube and Eva Longoria will enjoy the albatross references of their association to this movie for years to come.",

This 2025 remake isn't a film-it's a cry for help wrapped in a Teams call, sprinkled with alien noises, and served lukewarm via a Prime subscription you forgot to cancel.Let's start with the aesthetic. Imagine if a GCSE media class was told to make a sci-fi film using only screenshots, bad Wi-Fi, and a laptop with 2% battery. Now remove all humour, tension, and character development-and give Ice Cube a webcam and a plot he clearly didn't read. Voilà! You have War of the Worlds: 2025.The filmmakers-visionaries, I presume-have boldly decided to tell this epic tale almost entirely through video calls, file searches, and screen recordings. Because nothing screams cinema like watching a grown man mutter \"Can you hear me now?\" while an alien invasion supposedly unfolds offscreen. Hitchcock used suspense. Spielberg used wonder. This uses desktop notifications.Ice Cube stars as a sort of cyber-survivalist dad with the emotional range of a fax machine. He spends most of the film yelling into various devices, occasionally squinting at an alien threat that we're told is terrifying but which mostly looks like a Windows 98 screensaver gone rogue. I kept waiting for him to say, \"Alexa, save humanity,\" but alas, even that would've been too engaging.Eva Longoria phones it in-literally. Her performance is 40% lag, 60% existential regret. You can actually see the exact moment she realises she's trapped in a movie that feels like it was directed by Clippy, the old Microsoft Word assistant: \"It looks like you're trying to make a sci-fi film. Would you like some help?\"Plot-wise? Picture a disaster movie written by ChatGPT after one too many espressos and a broken caps lock key. The story unfolds (or rather, oozes) through dialogue that sounds like it was ripped from corporate training videos: \"We have to initiate the data protocol!\" \"Reboot the firewall!\" \"Send the drone!\" I kept expecting someone to share their screen and walk us through a pivot table.Then, just when you think it can't get any worse, the film goes full infomercial: a literal Amazon Prime delivery drone becomes a crucial plot device. I swear on Spielberg's beard. The world is ending, and the hero has to buy a gadget on Prime to fix it. I half-expected a pop-up: \"Customers who bought this item also saved civilisation.\"To be fair, a few reviewers online called it \"underrated\" and \"thought-provoking.\" I can only assume they were bots, bored interns, or sentient toasters trying to assimilate into human culture by watching the worst we have to offer.Watching this film felt like being slowly strangled by ethernet cables while Clippy cheers you on. It's not just a bad film-it's a philosophical event. A meditation on the futility of time, money, and broadband. A reminder that just because you can make a movie entirely on Zoom... doesn't mean you should.Final verdict:\nIf you've ever wanted to experience what it's like to die of secondhand embarrassment while waiting for a buffering screen to load the apocalypse, War of the Worlds (2025) is your masterpiece. For everyone else, I recommend looking at a turned-off TV for 90 minutes. More tension, better acting.",

Can I remind you that these guys have been on a creative streak - mixed in with some admittedly subpar work - with the likes of The Wild Robot?This is the studio that KNOWS how lighting, colour, expressions... every little detail right down to how the voice actor says the specific lines is what makes movies truly great. That an simply plot can be made so much more when you really put some effort into it.Yet this bring us this garbage, and everyone swarms around it, because...? Nostalgia?

Primarily, the dragon designs are all... awful, to say the least. From uncanny, to awkward, to horribly ugly, they turned the most visually interesting parts of the original film into strange Game of Thrones knock-offs. Silhouette\nAnother visual design choice I cannot fathom is why so much of the original atmosphere is muted or straight up nonexistent in the remake. Hiccup wandering through the forest, searching for Toothless after shooting him down... in the original, the unease and mystery of this scene was amplified by a dense misty forest and cold gray clouds looming overhead. Meanwhile, the remake has him strolling through a sunlit forest with vibrant colors. The color choices in many other scenes are strange, and sometimes make the backgrounds look like they're filming a stage production instead of a movie.As for the story... they read did just shot-for-shot remake the entire movie with a few minor changes + worse composition and framing. Can't say much other than it really shows how little this movie needed to be made. You want an interesting, heartwarming story? Watch the original film. There's no reason to watch this one instead, since they added nothing new of substance. They even managed to cut out small details (Toothless' pupils in his when Hiccup finds him shot down, the way he reacted when Hiccup first attached his prosthetic tail fin, the illustrations in the Book of Dragons moving, etc.) that make some of the most iconic scenes from the OG far less interesting.In many ways the visuals were awkward, so was the acting. A lot of scenes when Hiccup interacts with Toothless feel stilted and give off \"the actor waiting for cues\" vibes. Very little of it feels organic. Remake line deliveries pale in comparison to the original and the dialogue is worse all around. In many scenes where the dragons were quick and snappy to punctuate shocking moments or jokes, they instead move sluggishly and stiffly. Toothless alone feels far more like a real, living animal in the 2010 film than he does in the remake.No matter how bad they get, these live action remakes will rake in millions of dollars from nostalgia-blind fans and clueless newcomers. It's frustrating. We deserve better than this. I'm afraid they've already announced the second film will be churned into a Live-Action remake as well...

            "review": "The 2025 How to Train Your Dragon live-action remake is, quite frankly, one of the most unnecessary and uninspired retellings of an already-perfect story. This film doesn't just walk in the shadow of the beloved 2010 animated classic-it awkwardly tries to mimic it, scene by scene, line by line, yet completely misses what made the original special. It's like watching a high school stage play of a Broadway hit: technically the same plot, but stripped of all the emotional nuance, wonder, and magic.From the opening minutes, it's painfully obvious that this remake is a shot-for-shot copy of the original. Rather than reimagining or reinterpreting the material for a new audience or medium, the filmmakers seem to have opened the original script, made zero meaningful edits, and simply recast the scenes with live actors and awkward CGI dragons. And yet somehow, despite following the exact same blueprint, they manage to drain the soul out of every single moment.The original How to Train Your Dragon was a masterpiece because it had heart. It captured complex emotions like fear, empathy, courage, and growth in a way that resonated with both kids and adults. The bond between Hiccup and Toothless wasn't just cute - it was profound. You could feel their connection. Every scene had purpose. Every visual was alive with color, energy, and soul.This remake, on the other hand, feels sterile. Hiccup, now played by a live-action actor who seems perpetually unsure whether he's in a fantasy epic or a CW teen drama, lacks the charm and vulnerability of his animated counterpart. Astrid is there, and she says the same lines, but the chemistry is missing. The Vikings? Forgettable. Even Stoick the Vast, who was once a towering, emotionally complex father figure, now just feels like a generic grumpy dad cosplay.And then there's Toothless. Oh, Toothless. One of the most expressive, beloved characters in modern animation has been turned into a CGI creature that looks like it escaped from a PlayStation 4 cutscene. In animation, Toothless was full of personality - his subtle head tilts, cat-like movements, and wide eyes told stories without words. In this version, the CGI is so uncanny it's distracting. It's as if they focused more on rendering realistic textures than capturing character. You don't bond with this version of Toothless - you just stare at him, detached, wondering why he looks so off.There's no sense of wonder here. The cinematography is flat. The color palette is muted. The flight scenes - once soaring, heart-stopping sequences that defined the magic of the original - feel weightless and artificial. Even the score, while still beautiful in theory, fails to hit the same emotional highs because the visuals and storytelling simply don't support it.Worst of all, there's no reason for this remake to exist. It adds nothing new. No fresh perspective, no updated themes, no bold direction. It's just a dull, lifeless replica that hopes nostalgia alone will carry it through. But nostalgia isn't enough when the original is still easily accessible - and far better in every single way.Remakes can be wonderful when they honor the source while offering something new. This does neither. Instead, it plays like a studio boardroom decision brought to life: safe, predictable, and painfully hollow. If you're a fan of the original, do yourself a favor and skip this. Rewatch the animated trilogy instead - it's still soaring far above this crash-landed mess.",

Snotlout was cool.They added multiple nations in the village in order to shove into your face INCLUSIVITY but i think it was supposed to be remote village forgoten from god and that was part of the PLOT IN THE NEXT MOVIES.Generally even though it was watchable it offers a degraded quality in all aspects of the original and doesnt offer anything new in return.

Downright insulting.Half the cast are such incredible matches for the characters original looks, voices and personalities and the rest are so random and completely destroy any hint of immersion in the film, especially as someone who's grown up with the series. Disgraceful.It tarnishes an otherwise amazing film and although it may seem like a small or picky point every single time Astrid or Ruffnut comes on screen - which is quite often, with Astrid being one of the most important characters in the film - you're completely ripped out of Berk and back to reality.To summarise my views in one sentence I'd like to note that I didn't even realise who Bronwyn was supposed to be until halfway through the movie.",

There is clearly a lack of, (or lack of funding for) writers who have original stories .Having just watched the film, I still question 'Why make it? ' and it still comes back to it's a cash grab.There is nothing new, they have basically lifted the cartoon scene by scene into 'live action' i.e. A real person with a lot of CGI around them.So essentially your watching an identical film to the cartoon, telling the exact same story in the exact same way. .Mildly irritating was they had to give a little lecture on inclusivity and diversity. Stoic (Butler) did explain that all the 'tribes' of the Vikings had come together (which explained the diversity of the population).Curiously one of the few scenes they omitted from the cartoon, was the one where Hiccup learns with the baby dragons, they don't like eels and they can be burnt by fire into their mouths.This was an important scene, as it explains how, in many ways, Hiccup defeats the Queen. So you need to have seen the cartoon.Don't get me wrong, the live action is a good film, CGI is impressive, the acting is good.Again the question \"Why am I seeing the exact same story again?\" jars the whole viewing experience.I would give this film a 6.5/10 It is a 'good film' just a totally unnecessary one.Would I watch it again ? No, I would much prefer the original.",

Right at that point, there is one scene which is rather stupidly set-up to give way for the rest of the story...the one with the bus...but later things do improve.

Call it the John Wick school of cinema.Maybe as an eleven-year-old this may have worked for me. There is a ton of killing and mayhem in this, but none of the violence has any real consequences so there is zero in the way of tension.If they could have toned this down about one thousand percent, it may have made for an OK movie. Maybe kill about 300 fewer people and it would have been slightly more...I won't say believable, but slightly less idiotic.Along with the Motion Picture Association rating, they should include a body count for all movies. This one probably has more deaths than a movie of the Battle of Gettysburg. Isn't murder fun! And we wonder why we have such a violent society.

This follows the same case as John Wick. The first John Wick was good, but they killed it with the sequels. They should have stopped after the first one. \"I Am Wrath\" is also another good movie and better than this one.I have already seen good vigilante movies in the past. Death Wish and The Exterminator are prime examples of good movies that have survived into the present era. Vigilante 1983 starring the late Robert Forster and Fighting Back 1982 starring Tom Skerrit are also terrific.In Nobody(2021), the story follows a family man played by Bob Odenkirk(of Breaking Bad fame) who fails to stop some inept burglars from stealing his possessions. After which he has a change of heart and lashes out vigilante-style to vent out his anger. The rest of the movie deals with repercussions of his decisions.The acting in the movie is so-so.

I couldn't picture another actor in his role. I also like the supporting cast members, like Anil Kapoor, NTR, Kiara, and others. The action scenes are, in many cases, well-done. The best scene is the opening scene involving a samurai sword fight; it kinda reminded me of a clip from the John Wick franchise. The airplane scene later on is also thrilling . I'm not usually a fan of the songs in Bollywood movies, but I like the one with Hrithik and NTRNo spoilers - but the movie uses some flashbacks to flesh out Hrithik and NTR's characters. The young actors who play the younger version of their characters look the part. The casting was well done here.The movie has the following issues: though I like the action scenes most of the time, I didn't like the music blaring in the background. The slow motion works most of the time, but on a few occasions, the effect is cheesy. Some of the characters perform feats that push the movie into Marvel / DC comic book territory; it's as if Hrithik and NTR both had doses of super-soldier serum. Some parts are almost comedy. In the finale, we get a fight scene that occurs in a place that looks like Superman's fortress. In another scene, Hrithik and one of the supporting cast members are getting shot at by many henchman in a parking lot, yet they're able to stand behind a pillar and talk like they're in a cafeThe romance between Hrithik and Kiara wasn't right. They make clear that her father was like a father to Hrithik since Hrithik was a boy. I feel that their relationship should've been more like siblings than husband/wife. It's as if the film just felt that they had to insert a romance subplot somewhere, so they jammed this oneStill - I really enjoyed this one. I'm glad I went to the theaters to see it.

            "review": "Just came out from the First show of War 2 in the US and was overall entertained. It is a good action packed movie but does go a bit over the top for me. The highlights of the movie are its very well executed action set pieces with good stunt work and VFX. The story arcs for the characters of Colonel Luthra, Kabir and Vikram are well written. NTR Jr's role has some pretty interesting twists and turns while Kiara not only looks stunning but also packs a real punch. The couple of new characters introduced into the Spy Universe are also pretty Jhakaas and Alpha.The main attraction of the movie is of course Hrithik. He looks gritty, real (his age) and absolutely fantastic which is probably the reason my wife loved the movie. His high octane entry scene, his thrilling action sequences, his stylish dance moves, his trademark trembling face of anger and his teary eyed monologue are all present in the movie. Hrithik carries the movie but NTR Jr's fans will not be disappointed when he makes his entry, delivers some chill action sequences, shakes a fancy leg, reveals an interesting origin story and has an over the top but cool finale.The movie is long but is pretty quick moving from one action packed set piece to another. However in order to enjoy the movie, one has to be fine with Kabir's Alpha wolf dominates a real fierce wolf just with his sheer presence and looks, takes on an army of Katana wielding Ninjas, drives a car in the most unexpected places, performs some mind boggling stunts on boats, planes and trains, dodges and even survives some really lethal bullets. The songs are good but not at the same level as the original war. The mid-credit scene introducing the next chapter of the Spy Universe is pretty nice, especially the unexpected cameo. The mention of Pathaan and Tiger is cool but underwhelming because of their complete absence from the movie.On the YRF Spy Universe scale War 2 lands somewhere between War and Pathaan. It doesn't rise up to the level of Ek Tha Tiger and Tiger Zinda Hai but also doesn't take a dive to the Tiger 3 level. Its a fun entertaining watch for the action sequences, Hrithik and Spy Universe fans but dont expect a lot of heart and goosebumps. 7.5/10.",

Surprisingly, the standout was the child actor who played Jr. NTR's childhood role - absolutely brilliant!The first half might feel a bit predictable, but the intermission hooks you in. Unfortunately, the second half doesn't fully live up to the build-up - acting remains top-notch, but story-wise it's a bit underwhelming... So for me it's good to watch.",

            "review": "Spike Lee and Denzel Washington don't miss a beat in Lee's new film Highest 2 Lowest, taking Kurosawa's original film of the same name and running it straight up into Noo Yawk City. With this film, which keeps the action flowing from start to finish, Lee is unabashedly unreserved about his adoration for the greatest city in the world. In ways both overt and subtle, Lee transports the audience into 'Spike's World', weaving his personal preferences in art, music and, of course, his loyalty to the NY Yankees, with engrossing, non-stop action and a dash of humor.This is 1000% Lee's love song to New York City. From the dazzling beauty of the NYC skyline to the grit of a Bronx tenement, Lee puts his vision on the screen. Matthew Libatique, Lee's Director of Photography, gives us a melange of visual qualities within the film. From top-of-the-line digital to the graininess of 8MM, again, highest to lowest, the artistry here is unmistakeable. Highest 2 Lowest's basic premise, the kidnapping of a wealthy man's son, is Mr. Lee's fifth collaboration with Mr. Washington, and it hits every note perfectly.Paintings and portraits from Spike's personal collection, including Kehinde Wiley's 'Investiture of Bishop Harold as the Duke of Franconia', the depiction of a black man wearing a Brooklyn Dodger's number 42 jersey, Jackie Robinson's number, find pride of place on the walls of music mogul David King's (Denzel Washington) multi-million dollar DUMBO duplex. DUMBO, in case you're wondering, is Down Under The Manhattan Bridge Overpass, and is currently the most affluent part of Brooklyn. You can take Spike out of Brooklyn, but you'll never take Brooklyn out of Spike. The two are forever intertwined in Lee's filmography.Other works by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Patrick Martinez, Radcliff Bailey, even a Brooklyn Dodger's scoreboard, pieces that have been exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum, some of which are certainly from Lee's own home, decorate the office and home of King, his wife Pam (Ilfenesh Hadera) and their son Trey (Aubrey Joseph).King is in the middle of refinancing a multi-million dollar deal for his record company, Stackin' Hits. Pam is on the Board of various high-end charities that promote emerging Black artists. Trey believes himself to be an up and coming talent scout. Soon after dropping Trey off for summer basketball camp at LIU's downtown Brooklyn campus, and after successfully negotiating his business deal, King returns home in his Rolls Royce, chauffered by his oldest friend, Paul Christopher (Jeffrey Wright). Paul served time in prison, but King, believing strongly in second chances, which is a major theme in the film, has employed Christopher since his release. King is also godfather to Paul's son, Kyle (Elijah Wright). Kyle and Trey are as close as blood brothers, attending the LIU basketball camp together.After arriving home, King receives a phonecall from a man telling him that his son, Kyle, has been kidnapped, and the 'king's ransom' is $17.5 million. The plot quickly thickens when we learn that godson Kyle is also missing and in great danger. King and some NYPD detectives attempt to follow their leads, taking us for a ride on the NYC subway systems Number 4 and 6 trains.From the exuberance of cheering fans en route to a game at Yankee Stadium, through a Puerto Rican Day Festival featuring Brooklyn natives Rosie Perez, Anthony Ramos (yes, that's a holy crap moment right there) and Latin music legend, pianist, bandleader and Grammy winner Eddie Palmieri, the film is a celebration of the chaos, energy and diversity that make up this amazing city and all its boroughs. On a side note, Palmieri, a Harlem native, passed away just last week at the age of 88.Lee even takes a moment to pay homage to A24, the distributor of Highest 2 Lowest. Lee and the crew must have had a blast making this film. As you watch Denzel seamlessly switch vernaculars from business mogul to street slang, depending on his audience and what he's trying to accomplish, you know you're watching a master at work. So many Kings brought to you in the county of Kings, from a man who is still a King of cinema.",

I haven't rolled my eyes and thought \"this is so cringe\" so many times in a movie before. TERRIBLE editing and pacing. Very boring...jumping around skipping crucial scenes you'd expect to see. It seemed like it was written by a 13 year old. Some very bad acting...almost walked out early on but was hoping for a payoff that never really comes. Out of the whole 2+ hours there was maybe like 5 minutes of what I would call good or interesting choices. It's so over the top and cheesy, including most of the music that is getting undeserved praise. A lot of times it doesn't fit with what's happening on the screen much at all.

After watching the original movie High and Low by Akira Kurosawa I was intrigued to check out this remake by Spike Lee but gotta say I'm very disappointed in how far this movie falls short of Kurosawa's classic. In all honesty I don't believe Spike was the right person to even direct such a remake and instead I believe this movie should've been directed by someone like Scorsese who would've made the film the action thriller it should've been instead of this confusing mess that Spike Lee made. I'll rate this movie a 5 out of 10 due to the simple fact that the script is horrible despite Denzel Washington and Jeffery Wright carrying the movie, everyone else seemed like rookie actors who made the movie feel like a made for BET or Lifetime movie. I also have no idea why this movie went over 2 hours, lol I felt compelled to walk out the theater from being so underwhelmed for how cringeworthy the last 10 - 20 minutes of this movie became. I actually would've been more favorable towards this movie had it been shorter, like probably giving this a 6/10 but it just went on for far too long and quickly became a trainwreck to watch, it seemed as if Spike didn't even know how he wanted to end the movie so instead he prolonged it with unnecessary scenes. I believe this movie should've been released directly on Apple TV instead of having a short theatrical run.",

            "review": "I walked into this film with the belief that \"Denzel doesn't make bad movies.\" Sadly, this one proved me wrong-it may be one of the worst modern productions I've ever sat through.I can usually respect a strong storyline, compelling acting, clean directing, or even just quality visuals to support a film. This movie offered none of those. The focus work was sloppy, the scenes noisy, and the color grading looked as if five different studios took turns without any agreed theme. At times, it genuinely looked like it was shot on a potato. The opening scene, with a car's headlights mimicking an anamorphic lens flare, looked more like a fifth grader shining a flashlight into the camera than a deliberate artistic choice.While I admire and respect black excellence, the over-the-top delivery here felt forced and stripped the film of authenticity. When you need an actress to verbally explain to the audience why a character picked a certain currency based on its weight in a backpack, it's proof the script and storyline had no real substance. The result was a narrative that forced the audience through mental hoops that were either frustrating or sleep-inducing.Quite frankly, this felt less like a polished Denzel project and more like a neighborhood amateur film, obsessed with delivering a single message rather than creating true art. I've seen better, tighter productions from film students working on a fraction of the budget.In the end, this wasn't just a disappointing movie-it was an exhausting, agonizing experience. Not only do I want my $40 back, but I'd also like the three hours I wasted trying to convince myself it would somehow get better. My recommendation: avoid this!",

A remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1963; thriller \"High To Low\" (and Denzel's second Kurosawa adaptation if you count his role in \"The Magnificent Seven,\" a remake of a remake of \"The Seven Samurai\"), Lee allows Washington to strut as a Manhattan music mogul in a way that reminds one of his Frank Lucas in \"American Gangster\" until the son of his chauffeur (the superbly underplaying and great patter partner Jeffrey Wright) is kidnapped by a desperate ransomer (a briefly-on-break from impregnating Rhianna A$AP ROCKY). Washington and Lee having spent so much of their professional lives together just move in perfect sync together as Lee shoots in a quick urban groove, with echoes of his love letters to New York in \"Girl 6,\" \"He Got Game\" and \"25th Hour.\" Denzel of course as one of the greatest actors alive can move from proud to pleading in the blink of an eye, and Lee's masterful cinematic vocabulary carries him through every beat perfectly. With able support from great newcomers Ilfenesh Hadera and Elijah Wright, one hopes this doesn't mark the last time these two team-up; they just wake up an almost hopelessly corporate cinema like no one else.",

At the same time, he has made some pretty awful movies, particular Oldboy (2013) and Miracle at St. Anna. With his latest film, based on a reinterpretation of Akira Kurosawa's classic \"High and Low\", it falls quite flat and rough.For starters, there are some nice camerawork that helps presents the atmosphere and environment. Creating the vibe and energy of the city of New York. Lee does offer some fresh themes and concepts about it's characters, writing, and the political aspects, however it all feels confused, misplaced, and messy. The writing feels as if this new reinterpretation didn't offer anything special or interesting to the original and book, as if Lee confuses with what he wants to present and display. Alongside with some laughable bad dialogue, the performances are a mix bag. Denzel Washington does provide his best as his energy and personality is good. However some of the other performances are honestly pretty bad, particularly Ilfenesh Hadera. Almost as if the performances are TV levels of acting or being intentionally awful.The production designs and structure feels cheap and dated, almost as if the movie is having a Hallmark and Lifetime approach. The musical score is one of the worst aspects about this movie as it's presentation, sounding, and how the music is used is all over the place, messy, and atrocious. Regarding pacing, it drags, as the pacing remains uneven and it's first and second act really struggles. However, around it's third act, it does pick up with some interesting and good thrilling moments.I'm honestly kind of surprised with the positive reviews because audiences and critics have been raving this reinterpretation, however I found it to be tedious and frustrating. I do appreciate it isn't as disgraceful as Lee's remake of \"Oldboy\" (which I'm glad to hear he has since disowned the movie). However, no matter what, it's pretty clear that it's best to stay away from remaking classics because it ain't worth it.",

Loved his first, She's gotta have it, Malcolm X (too long), Do the Right Thing (too long), but I never got past the few other movies I saw. IMO the scoring of his movies is atrocious. And he seems to stretch out the scenes filled with dialog too long to the point you want to say \"cut\" or edit. And that's what I felt watching this \"Apple Studio\" movie. Spike in an interview said Apple was the only studio that would finance it. It's going straight to stream in about two weeks.The acting is subpar and his close-ups of Denzel pondering decisions are laughable. Most of the actors are TV actors so that explains it the subpar-ness.The movie perks up when the ransom drop takes place, but even then you wonder - WHAT the H? The money bag is passed from moto biker to moto biker and the police lose the actual money bag. From my understanding when there's a kidnapping and ransom of a high-powered executive like David King, the FBI takes the lead. Did Spike NOT do his home work?Denzel is in every scene and that can be a bit too much. I wished to see more of the police work to find the kidnapper, but that falls to Denzel and his chauffeur. Which wouldn't happen in real life. An executive of a record company wouldn't go on the hunt himself. IMO. He would have security do it. Which was also a head-scratcher.

The Acting was phenomenally done by a star-studded cast, it was very well Directed, very well Written and the Cinematography was top tier. Despite the slow build up to the tension, once it got started, it kept you on the edge of your seat, especially with some unexpected twist and turns. Additionally, the Cast was very visually compelling to watch, along with the beautiful Brooklyn scenery. This movie really captures it and it makes you feel like you are there. Nonetheless, with all the great things that has been said, don't get swept away by the theatrical experience that you miss the message of the movie.

Highest 2 Lowest is one of the best movies of the year and one of the top crime movies of all time.Music mogul David Kin (Denzel Washington) is threatened to be personally and professionally dethroned by the kidnapping of his son, Trey (Aubrey Joseph), by criminals unknown until later. It is revelatory to see the police navigate kidnapping with the social-media challenges that attack the high-profile dad for the way he deals with the demands of the crooks, the public, and morality.Lee has a field day playing the racial tensions between the races, including this time Puerto Rico and Cuba and who knows how many others in the biggest melting pot ion the world. Lee makes the conflicts lyrical with music that inspires community and love.The love letter to New York by cinematographer Matthew Libatique is beautiful as well as complementary to the complex plot and the NY vision usually accompanying a Lee movie. The beautiful landscape belies the ugly proceedings as King is morally challenged by a twist in which he becomes responsible for the ransom of a child not his own. It's a personally and publicly Hobson's choice that Denzel handles with Oscar-nominating dexterity.Oscar-worthy is his face off with the kidnapper. The rapping motif is jaw-droppingly expert and electrifying. Denzel carries it off with the cool mastering that makes him one of the top actors of his generation.In a logical comparison with Michael Douglas's Gordon Gekko of Wall Street, Denzel's King is less impressive if only for the wide range Douglas's script gives, yet the studio rapper scene in Higher is a tour de force for Denzel.

Relationships are messy, people are flawed, and life doesn't always come with closure.",

            "review": "Metro In Dino opens with one of the best musical beginnings, where characters break the fourth wall and instantly pull you in. You do not even realise when twenty minutes have flown by. Everyone in the cast does well, though Ali and Fatima come across as slightly stiff in emotionally charged scenes. Adi is effortless and charismatic, and Sara pairs well with him. Neena Gupta and Anupam Kher remind you of their experience with ease. Pankaj and Konkona are the real standouts, with Pankaj bringing sharp comic timing through his subtle expressions and improvised bits. Pritam's music is wonderfully woven into the narrative. The songs do not just support the story, they carry its soul.The first half is tight and keeps you thoroughly engaged.It is the second half where the film loses some grip. The storylines begin to feel stretched, and the endings are not clearly defined. A few subplots could have been skipped to bring in more clarity and depth. That said, the camerawork and visual setups in some scenes are beautiful and worth appreciating. The film explores themes of infidelity and emotional detachment, and it leaves you with a feeling that this is the generalisation the film wants you to settle with. The resolution feels rushed and a bit too convenient. In the end, Metro In Dino remains a musically rich experience with a gripping first half, but the latter part misses the same emotional weight and leaves you wishing for a more satisfying conclusion.OVERALL 7.5/10.",

            "review": "This movie is really hard to watch. It feels mentally exhausting and pointless. Most of the positive reviews online don't seem real-they look fake or overly promoted.Sara Ali Khan still needs to improve her acting. Her performance doesn't connect. On the other hand, Ali Fazal, Anupam Kher, Konana , Aditya and Neena Gupta acted really well and gave strong performances. They were the only good part of the film.Instead of focusing on a proper story, the movie feels like a Pritam music album. Nearly half the movie is just him singing. It's like they forgot they were making a film and just turned it into a concert.This movie doesn't even come close-maybe not even 5%-to what Life in a... Metro was. That 2007 film was a masterpiece with great storytelling, strong emotions, and music that added meaning. I don't understand how they could ruin something that had so much potential.The direction is very poor and confusing. There's no clear flow or depth in the scenes. Every second scene shows Pritam singing on a terrace or walking down a street with a guitar. It feels unnecessary and forced. The audience in the theatre even started laughing when he showed up again and again-it became silly after a point.Music should support a movie, not take over the entire thing. They had the chance to make something meaningful, but they completely wasted it. This was a major disappointmentThree star only for Ali , Neena , Anupam, Aditya , Konona.",

Metro, but falls just short.Anurag Basu, known for his heartfelt, layered storytelling in films like Life in a... Metro, Gangster, Barfi!, and Ludo, returns with Metro... In Dino - a film that attempts to revisit the emotional and interconnected lives of people in a bustling city like Mumbai. While it brings some strong moments and thoughtful themes, it doesn't quite achieve the narrative tightness or emotional resonance of its 2007 predecessor.Plot Summary (No Major Spoilers):\nThe film follows four parallel stories, each centered around love, loss, and rediscovery:Akash & Shruti - A married couple on the brink of parenthood, struggling with financial issues and career setbacks. The stress convinces them to consider abortion, raising deep moral and emotional questions.Parth & Chumki - Chumki, a corporate employee engaged to someone she's unsure about, meets Parth. Their relationship blooms amidst complications, offering a glimpse into modern love and hesitation.Kajol & Monty - A married couple with a teenage daughter, facing emotional decay as Monty turns to dating apps in search of excitement. Kajol's quiet hurt is among the more affecting aspects of the film.Shibani & Parimal - Shibani, the mother of Chumki and Kajol, is an older woman who finds companionship in Parimal after years of dealing with her husband's betrayal. Their story offers the most gentle and emotionally honest moments in the film.Each story unfolds in its own arc but eventually intersects, mirroring the structure of Life in a... Metro, though without the same emotional impact.What Works:\nPerformances: The cast delivers solid, believable performances, especially the more experienced actors like Neena Gupta (as Shibani) and Anupam Kher (as Parimal). Sara Ali Khan somehow made a very decent comeback as Chumki, and Ali Fazal & Fatima Sana deliver a very nuanced performance.Pankaj Tripathi performs immaculately, but Konkona & Aditya were very flat in their performance and didn't create much impact in the story.Music: Pritam manages to maintain the live band sequence this time with Papon & Raghav Chaitanya, similar to Life in a Metro, and delivers a few emotionally resonant tracks that complement the tone. Zamaana Lage and Dil Ka Kya were the main highlights. But too many songs and the balance between scenes & music ratio was off compared to Life in a Metro.Themes: The film captures relevant emotional and relational issues - urban isolation, generational gaps, infidelity, and the search for meaningful connection, but the 2nd half becomes extremely far-fetched and loses momentum later on, making the end very less tight and out of context.Overall, this is a one-time watch. While it starts off with a good narrative, the second half becomes too stretched with too many songs, and the editing is less crisp. Maybe a tighter ending, this would've been my two cents of advice to Anurag Basu.",

Anurag Basu is a master of seeing people being happy and wholesome in otherwise hopeless situations. That's the soul of his movies.That is not the case in this movie. The movie is filled with things that are totally unlike what Anurag makes. Maybe he had changed a lot of things to fulfil the wishes of the overlords and make this ambitious project happen.

With Metro... In Dino, it's like he forgot what made it special in the first place. Sometimes, trying to recreate magic only reminds you of its absence.\"Metro... In Dino\" attempts to recreate the grounded emotional mosaic of Anurag Basu's earlier urban anthologies like Life in a... Metro (2007), but this time, the soul seems largely missing. The film juggles multiple short stories set in today's chaotic, restless urban life-but the threads barely connect on a deeper level.What once felt intimate and raw now comes across as safe and polished. Despite a stellar ensemble cast-Aditya Roy Kapur, Sara Ali Khan, Konkona Sen Sharma, Ali Fazal, Fatima Sana Shaikh, and more-the characters often feel like sketches rather than real people. The performances are competent, but the screenplay rarely gives them space to breathe. There are glimpses of warmth and nostalgia, especially in Pritam's music and some of Basu's quieter visual moments, but they're fleeting.Where the original Metro pierced with its emotional sincerity and understated pain, In Dino chooses more decorative storytelling. It talks about loneliness, fleeting love, and broken dreams, but doesn't let us feel them the way we should.",

If anything, Fahadh's performance stands out as the saving grace in an otherwise uneven ride.Verdict: A different attempt, but only partly effective. Watch it mainly for Fahadh Faasil.",

The bond between the characters was natural, the cinematography and the music was appreciable.While the first half was good, the second half brings a total shift in tone and genre and suddenly it becomes a revenge story.The second half brings the ultimate twist and while it seemed good on paper, the execution was flat and very textbook. A lot of flaws in terms of writing as well as loopholes in the plot, the story was definitely gripping, however the way it was delivered was half cooked - thus ruining the whole setup of the movie.While the second half was marked with flaws, I still feel the movie is a decent watch, although it's not something special worth remembering about.My Rating : 3/5.",

The supporting cast does a decent job, but they don't leave the same lasting impression. What makes Relay stand out is its grounded approach and storytelling, helped by its well written screenplay.However, while I thoroughly enjoyed Relay, I doubt the film will be spoken about much past this month.

Originally called THE BROKER, it was featured on the 2019 \"Black-List\" of most-liked unproduced screenplays. It tells the story of whistleblower Sarah Grant (Lilly James) who changes her mind about going public with very sensitive and damning documents from a big bioengineering company. She is recommended to call an anonymous broker to help give back the documents while keeping herself safe. The broker, played by Riz Ahmed, keeps his anonymity by using a telecommunications device for the deaf, connected to the Tri-State Relay Service. It's a pretty cool concept that uses a totally real service in such a creative way. This movie feels bigger than it actually is. There was almost no marketing for it, so almost nobody is actually watching it. I'm a huge fan of Riz Ahmed. Ever since he broke out in the series THE NIGHT OF, he's been doing great things. This is the second movie with him that represents the deaf community, the other being the wonderful SOUND OF METAL. As I've been thinking more about this movie's ending though, without giving anything away, I think it could've been a little smoother, especially in today's society. I also think a little more mystery was needed in certain aspects. Riz's palpable quiet intensity and the nice tension-building are what ultimately drew me into this.

Some might be bored by some of the repetitiveness of some of the scenes, the main character's methodological preparations for everything he did to protect his client (and to keep order in his own life - you'll understand why when you see the movie). And the repetitiveness all makes sense as the movie comes together.The acting is excellent. Have always loved the two main players, Riz Ahmed and Lily James. While not an \"action\" movie in the traditional sense of the word, I would still consider this to be in the \"thriller\" category. The tension is often palpable, the cat and mouse quite clever. And the twistiness towards the end is both surprising and fun.Despite it's thriller-ish attitude, it is also a fairly small, quiet movie. There is little dialog other than conversation through the Tri-State Relay System, which gives much of that dialog an almost robotic feeling.

It's unfortunate to say because it's clear that the filmmakers are wanting to create something fun and Logan Lerman and Molly Gordon both are doing their best. However by simply creating a modern-like version of Misery but with romance, drama, teen vibes, and absurd nature blended together to make a non-serious approach doesn't work. Rather, it becomes repetitive, annoying, and frustrating. Conventional frustrating character decisions and annoying forced absurd nature, it felt as if the filmmakers watched Jennifer's Body and somehow misunderstood the comedic purpose and tone, and decided to make a more messy absurd feature that comes off more edgy and forced, rather something brilliant.To top it off with terrible characters and awful dialogue, it becomes more an aggravating experience. Many of the characters personalities feel like Hollywood cliches, the production designs are cheap, and the musical score was pretty overbearing. I do understand it's meant to be non-serious, but the issue is that the writing and poor approach doesn't really do justice. It comes off as sloppy and doesn't seem to have a real strong purpose.Props for Lerman and Gordon for doing their best tho.",

The actors were funny and likable, and the idea is amusing, but the way the entire film is presented makes it feel like a script that was written by a grade school child.Firstly, I'll talk about the good. The opening 20-30 minutes was cute. The actor's chemistry mixed with some gorgeous cinematography made for quite the romantic setting. I was thoroughly enjoying what I was seeing. It's when the awkward sex scene mixed with the handcuffs begins that the film gets beyond bizarre and the story slips into someone's weird and childish fantasy brought to life.The decisions the characters made had no real world weight to them. I mean for the plot to work, both of the main characters would have to have the mental capacity of a 13 year old. No adult would do the things that are done in the film. From the whole hostage situation in hopes for love, all the way up to doing the witchy seance scene that was something only a teenage girl would think of. It all just seemed so unrealistic and far removed from anything remotely palpable.The ending also left a lot to be desired. There is absolutely no way, and I mean NO WAY, that I would've been the one apologizing after being handcuffed to a bed for 48 hours, and enduring what the main character had to endure for more than half of the film's runtime. Nor would she be the one I would be calling help for after, literally, speeding away from what was at that point a crime scene.On the flipside, if a person didn't want a relationship, I honestly can't think of anybody that would take them out for a weekend together in the countryside. Complete with pretty music, wine, romance and all the extra things you could think of. And we're talking proposal level romantic here. The creator must have a really low opinion of males to think that this is a real thing someone would do for just a bit of fun. It's borderline offensive.Overall, I can't recommend it. Far too unrealistic, and campy but in all the wrong ways. Again, this felt like a teenager's fantasy brought to life, but the film was far too adult for anything a teenager could be allowed to watch. All I could think of at the credits was the creator must have the mind of a child, and I wonder who hurt her to make this screenplay happen. The first 20-30 minutes are very sweet, but ultimately misleading as to the context of the rest of the film. And although the film does have some interesting points to make about love and the fear of relationships, it was just too dumb to be taken as anything more than a footnote in the larger picture here.2 broken hearts out of 5.",

Going into the theater, I had moderate expectations, hoping at the very least for a compelling narrative or standout performances. Unfortunately, what unfolded on screen was a sluggish, disjointed, and ultimately disappointing experience that left me more frustrated than entertained.From the outset, the movie struggled with pacing. The story trudged along without a clear direction or sense of urgency, and scenes often felt stretched far beyond their purpose. It was as though the filmmakers were trying to build tension or depth, but instead, they created a slow, meandering plot that failed to hold attention. Instead of drawing me in, it made me painfully aware of each passing minute. I've had dreams more compelling and coherent than this film's storyline-and that's not hyperbole.The core plot was muddled and, worse, problematic in several key areas. One of the most concerning elements of the film was its depiction of domestic violence and how that subject was handled. Rather than thoughtfully exploring the complexity of this issue, especially as it affects men-who are often overlooked and underrepresented in these narratives-the film seemed to ignore the reality of male victims. Instead of offering a nuanced or empathetic perspective, it left the impression that men are either not believable or not worth supporting when they come forward. This is not just an oversight; it's a dangerous message to send.As the film progressed, any hope for resolution or depth in its treatment of serious themes evaporated. By the end, there was a strange sense of forgiveness and closure that felt entirely unearned. The characters seemed to brush past major trauma and complex emotional wounds with little to no reckoning. It gave the impression that the writers were more concerned with wrapping things up neatly than dealing with the gravity of what had unfolded. This approach felt not only unrealistic but insensitive.The film also dipped into elements of witchcraft and the supernatural, which might have been intriguing in a more cohesive or stylized narrative. Instead, these elements felt out of place and poorly integrated. Rather than adding to the atmosphere or offering symbolic weight, they seemed like distractions-poorly executed attempts to spice up an otherwise flat script.As for the performances, the actors did what they could with the material they were given. It's clear that the cast tried to bring some life to the lifeless script, and at times, there were flashes of genuine talent. But even the best acting can't save a film burdened with bad writing, weak character development, and unclear thematic intentions. In this case, the cast was ultimately let down by the script, the direction, and the overall lack of coherence in the story.The movie also contained multiple sexually explicit scenes, most of which felt gratuitous rather than meaningful. Instead of serving the narrative or deepening the characters, these scenes seemed thrown in for shock value or filler. Combined with the other tonal inconsistencies and underdeveloped themes, they only contributed to the film's overall feeling of confusion and lack of direction.In the end, it's difficult to imagine this movie surviving long at the box office or leaving any kind of meaningful mark. Between the poor pacing, the troubling thematic choices, the lackluster writing, and the uneven tone, there's little here to recommend. I walked out of the theater not just disappointed, but genuinely concerned about the kind of message this film sends-especially regarding sensitive issues like domestic violence.This was a missed opportunity on all fronts.",

I didn't expect much because I hadn't even heard of it, but it turned out way better than anticipated. It has one of those absolutely bonkers premises that somehow works. The opening pulls you in quickly, and the cast has great chemistry that carries the film.From the start, I genuinely had no idea the story would take the turns it did, I assume maybe the trailer could be revealing but I hadn't seen it. The handcuffs gave me vague \"Gerald's Game\" vibes, though this takes things in a much more comedic direction. Her making breakfast had me laughing out loud. The movie just generally a lot of laughs from everybody.It's definitely a \"shut your brain off to enjoy\" kind of film. Some character decisions aren't the most logical, but the humor makes it work. Molly's descent into chaos was oddly believable; it was wild but never so over the top that it pulled me out of it. It does lose a bit of momentum in the middle, with the characters(plus you, yourself watching) just waiting to see how this all ends. But the finale ties everything up nicely.I was surprised I hadn't seen this movie advertised anywhere, but turns out this screening was a month before the official release. Hopefully, more people see it then because it worth a watch. All four, or five, of the main actors have great performances and chemistry which is what made the movie fun. Especially Molly Gordon.Also, side note, it always blows my mind how long it takes to make movies. Every Q&A I've been to has someone saying, \"we've been working on this for 7 years.\"I also hope the blooopers for this come out, I feel like it'd be a really fun watch.",

How someone read such a basic story and said yeah, let's put a few million behind it. Actors were fine except for Geraldine Viswanathan's fake accent that she would punch every few lines. I'm a fan of hers from other work, just not sure why the accent was needed especially since she could not pull it off. The main guy did a good job at playing a d!ck and the main girl did an equally good job at playing crazy. Luckily, it will be a very forgettable movie which is a good thing.",

A rare genre in the movie theatres these days so go check it out.The two leads kep my interest with their chemistry, good acting, interesting script and the leads great voices. Keeping interest via just two people acting takes talent and chemistry.Some of the scenes when thought about them were very dark but the leads ability to make it lighter elicited a lot of laughs in the theatre when I watched it as the Screen Unseen at AMC.This movie actually brought a lot of laughs while I watched it But as mentioned there is some dark stuff going but without giving away the story and movie would suggest go watch this movie. A movie that could appeal, as the audience at the theatre I attended prove, to a wide demographics of adults from late teens up thru 80s and beyond. Seriously I had never seen such a wide spread of age in a movie theatre, the theatre was packed. Plus both guys and females and wide assortment of cultures. Great to see a movie that can connect to pretty much anyone. I found it more a PG-13 than R(which its rated).",

Now, it is obviously made by and for a different generation than mine (Millennial). But I think that if you're at least a little open to it, you can have fun. I enjoy awkward characters and situations. And thats pretty much this whole film. Its a comedic and modern homage to Misery (1990).Positives!+Quirky fun dialogue.+Main characters are odd and entertaining to watch.+Good use of music throughout.+Chuckles all along the way.Negatives!-Lacks big laughs.-Ending was sufficient, but unsatisfying.-No real resolution to the character problems.Overall, Oh, Hi! Is a quirky and funny movie. It does lack any big laughs though; just continuous chuckles. The cast solidly plays their parts.

But I think the film delivers a hilarious movie with some excellent comedy throughout the movie as I found myself to truly be dying at some of the jokes thrown in this movie as they really did land for me and I found myself to have a great time with this film and the comedy elements thrown into this film. I found the romantic parts to be intriguing as well and found our leads to be such interesting characters and I really loved these characters of Iris played by Molly Gordon and also Isaac played by Logan Lerman who personally was my favorite character in this film and I really loved his performance. My one complaint with the characters is I wish they had more depth to them and sometimes in my personal opinion in some scenes they feel bland and boring but other than that I really do like these characters a lot. I also really liked the story they told in this film as I honestly expected to go into a Rom-Com but I was kind of surprised by the direction they take the romantic elements in this movie as I really found this direction to be really interesting for me and I really liked the direction they took as it didn't feel like every other boring rom-com with nothing going on in this film but I found this film to be a really fun and hilarious time. One other complaint in my opinion is I'm not the biggest fan of the ending since it felt like everything happened so quickly and I wish the movie would've been longer so we could've explored some of this stuff that happened at the end some more and it felt sort of rushed near the end in my personal opinion but other than my little complaints I found myself to have a great time with this movie and going into this movie with no expectations at all I was pleasantly surprised with this movie and I honestly throughly enjoyed it and I think this is worth checking out in theaters for sure once it officially releases theatrically.",

The romance of the couple seeing their getaway house was so sweet. But when Iris tries to perform to keep the guy and he's trapped on the bed, I got bored. She was telling him stories, behaving manically, it seemed like a long monologue. There were isolated short parts that were funny. Like Max confessing to her boyfriend or the neighbor guy or Iris hurting her back trying to turn at the foot of the bed.But it seemed as if they were just putting things in hoping something stuck. I don't like when movies are too formulaic (this movie isn't), but the movie needed some structure in the writing and storytelling.

            "review": "Many years ago I made the tragic error of breaking up with a woman at my place. I was young, dumb and unaware of the rules of disengagement. With no means of escape the situation turned into a protracted nightmare from which I still suffer PTSD.Nothing compares to the uncoupling gaffe Logan Lerman's Isaac is responsible for in Director Sophie Brooks' new feature Oh Hi!. It is as perplexing as it is unforgiveable except for the fact the movie would be a 20 minute short without it.Isaac and Molly Gordon's Iris are on an idealized version of a romantic getaway in upstate New York. There's oodles of sex, seafood and sunsets. The fun comes to a whiplash inducing halt when the young (ish) lovers realize they do not share the same relationship goals. Iris wants to lock it down while Isaac wants to keep things chill.Throughout Oh Hi! There is a hint of detachment to Lerman's Isaac which comes more into full view during his brief mea culpa in the third act.Gordon, for her part, plays Iris with a yearning sweetness that turns into progressively manic behaviour (there's my PTSD again).Oh Hi!'s biggest flaws are the broader comedic elements such as handcuffs and witchcraft. Perhaps Brooks and Gordon knew their story/script didn't have the chops to match something like Celine Song's recent Materialists or better yet Past Lives. In lieu of letting words do the talking they went a little high concept for a relationship dramedy.Perhaps it is odd for me to say but Oh Hi! Made me harken back to Peter Berg's 1998 Very Bad Things. I thought I was getting a film about a group of normal guys who take things too far at a bachelor party. Instead Christian Slater's Robert is a psychopath and this helped make Very Bad Things a Very Bad Movie. In the middle section of Oh Hi! Iris behaves almost as CRAZY as Robert. Something a little more grounded would have been better.We are entrenched in an era of filmmaking where accountability and female characters go together like vampires and sunlight. It all started with Reese Witherspoon's Cheryl in 2014's Wild and hit a baffling zenith with Nicole Kidman's Romy in 2024's Babygirl. In the latter film, if we gender swapped the two lead roles, the male CEO would end up in prison by the 25th minute.Oh Hi! Is to be commended for only allowing Iris partially off the hook. The film leans into the fact Iris is behaving like the stereotypical manic female. She obsesses over Isaac, latching onto minor details and refusing to see any way forward which isn't together.Brooks and Gordon create a female character it appears not only wants a man but needs one. Oh Hi! May get them uninvited from the Hollywood radical feminist book club - second wave, I believe. The movie isn't always good but it is rather exceptional in how it doesn't outright hate or blame men for the onscreen action.In fact, Oh Hi! Has a large amount of affection for the type of non threatening, non alpha typified by Isaac and John Reynolds' Kenny. Men like this are soft spoken and don't know how to drive. They will, however, cook a girl a mean scallop and go down on her in broad daylight.Sounds like progress for all involved.",

            "review": "This is the worst movie that I have EVER had the displeasure of watching. I have never before been so upset with a movie that I felt the need to write a review over it, and I saw Cats. It fails on every single count of what makes a good movie. I do not know how this movie has the rating it does; it genuinely boggles my mind. Do not let the rating fool you. It is, simply put, not worth watching. Let's begin with my favorite aspect of a good movie, the writing. If I were asked to sum up this movie's writing in a single word, that word would be \"stupid\". It is genuinely nonsensical. Any dinosaur movie will naturally have logical inconsistencies and plot holes; that is what happens when screenwriters have to think of a way to make creatures that died out over 65 million years ago pose a threat now. It would be unreasonable to expect a \"realistic\" explanation for this, which is not a fair standard, as a viewer must assume a certain level of suspension of disbelief. HOWEVER, a self-respecting movie should at least have decency of internal consistency and compelling characters, both of which are sorely absent. The plot is both nonsensical and inconsistent; the dinosaurs are extremely lethal and bulletproof in one scene and in the next have the strength and durability of wet tissue paper. The same can be said of characters' weapons, skills, intelligence, etc. The character development and emotional appeal are hamfisted at best, nonexistent at worst. There is more chemistry and emotional depth demonstrated within two T. Rexes interacting in a ~15-second clip than the entire rest of the characters combined. The explanations are obviously techno-babble that violates several laws of physics and shows a complete misunderstanding of basic science, but that's to be expected with a movie of this quality. The plot is overall exceptionally weak. So much so that, as someone who used to tutor students, I have seen better writing skills, both in narrative consistency and development, in a literal twelve-year-old. This writing is an insult to good cinema writing. It is so bad that I would like to call it AI-generated, in dire hope that no human screenwriter could think this level of writing is acceptable on a screen, but that would be an insult to AI. The acting is not much better. It is better for sure. I cannot argue that it isn't, but that is a very, very, low bar. Most of the lines and performances are flat and uninspired, the pronunciation of basic words like \"Ruski\" is wrong, and the Russian (as a native speaker) is terrible, as are the Russian accents. The redeeming factor of this movie could have been its visual appeal and sound design. Unfortunately, it is not. The jungles are actually rather pretty, but the fight scenes, which make up a large chunk of the movie, are obnoxiously loud, jumbled messes of quick cuts. The CGI is subpar, especially when it comes to injuries, as they often don't match up with what is shown. Sound design is not great either. I am by no means an expert, but even I noticed instances of noise not lining up with what's happening on screen and generally low-tier CGI. The visual appeal is definitely the strongest suit, though that is a low bar. I struggle to think of positive remarks to make about this movie, so I will simply conclude with a summary and overall points. I am not an overly pretentious snob, while I prefer movies like Oppenheimer over movies like Rambo, I still enjoyed Rambo. Some movies have a great cast with exceptional acting that pulls you right into the scene and grips your attention. Other movies have a gripping narrative that develops naturally and is perfectly timed. Others still are just plain fun to watch and delight in the sound and visual design, even if they might be weaker on the first two elements. Sometimes movies can even be so bad, fail so profoundly that they are hilarious and still fun to watch, like \"Sharknado\" or \"Shark Side of the Moon\". This movie is none of these things. It fails on every count of being remotely enjoyable, and frankly, I am embarrassed that I bought tickets and in some small way benefited the people who created it. DO NOT WATCH.",

Intense and amazing! Definitely worth seeing!!",

Why more dino action and screen time than any of the recent Jurassic Park movies. And unlike the newer Jurassic entries the dinosaurs actually feel threatening throughout the film. A+ job here, would rather rewatch this then any of the Jurassic films except the first one.The plot was a decent cheesy sci-fi action plot, but overall isn't super important to the enjoyability of the film. Your not watching this movie for the plot anyways.Very enjoyable, fun, fast paced, action packed feast for the eyes and heart.",

I would say I enjoyed it way more than some of the last couple of dinosaur movies to come out not naming any names because they still had good things about them.

If you're a fan of dinosaurs and want a mature tone for your dinosaur media than this is right up your alley, it's not a field trip in the jungle it's a fight for survival and seeing that in a serious tone with consequences was great to see on the big screen. As Luke Sparke said on InGeneral: The Jurassic Outpost Podcast, he said he loves randomness with his dinosaurs and them just being animals and you get a lot of that in this movie. From grazing, to hunting (some were on demon mode), to sleeping they captured the dinosaurs in a great way (while showing off how dangerous and deadly they are).The Marines and their story took me by surprise with how good it was and how they got a story and honestly the struggles of war and PTSD and just mental health was captured really well and something that caught me off guard. The characters were good and did their job only some were a tad questionable but it's not that bad. The dialogue was good and I was surprised with how funny it was? I guess because it is a war movie set in Vietnam you can use colourful language and they didn't shy away from it and it really sets the tone.The gore was INTENSE and I'm definitely not use to seeing that in a Dinosaur movie and it was a nice change showing how dangerous a dinosaur is and so much death, I honestly lost count in the first 15 mins there was so much and it was fun a fun WILD ride. For an independent film, the scale is amazing I honestly can't get over how great it was and you can just tell how much passion is in this movie, Luke Sparke is like us A HUGE dinosaur fan that achieved his dream and made his dinosaur movie, I genuinely think you should check it out if you love Dinosaurs and as a Jurassic Park/World fan we need competition and competition breeds greatness, we need more dinosaur media in general and this is the right way forward as a Dinosaur fan. So enough of me yappin and go check out Primitive War.",

They performed a literal miracle with the budget they had. The dinosaurs look incredible. It's campy and ridiculous and over the top but it freaking works! Ryan Kwanten is the king of B movies and he doesn't let anyone down in this one. I was worried in the first twenty minutes or so because it really felt like they were trying so hard to get you to care about the characters and I really couldn't, they felt flat. But an hour in I cared about all of them. The subplot with how the dinos came to be in Vietnam was also ridiculous but in the best possible way. I don't want to give any spoilers because I think you should just see it in the theater while you have a chance, I don't think it'll be the same watching it at home. A lot of it is also shot very very dark so I can imagine it being difficult to see exactly what's going on watching on a TV screen. Jeremy Piven, say what you want about him, is also hilariously over the top in his performance. You can tell he had a lot of fun with this. There's a specific scene with a tiger that had me actually laugh out loud a little, and then a scene near the end in a helicopter where he's yelling that got me laughing again. That dude has charisma whether you like him or not. I'm going to try to see this again with some more friends before it's gone.",

Jeremy Piven was almost unwatchable (I love him as Ari, and from PCU, but his accent, lines, and delivery were beyond wooden), and the \"Russians\" sounded like an amateur trying to pretend to be Russian, not a supposedly trained actor. The military porn is hopeless (every American military stereotype to the point it's an absolute insult to every soldier who's put on the uniform), and the dinosaurs go from being impervious to bullets to being able to be hacked apart by a tired grunt with a machete in the same, final scene?!The dinosaurs looked decent (one star of the 3), and there were a few genuinely deep moments (the leader [sergeant, I think? They were so generic I couldn't have cared less] having a moment with a soldier who's going through a mental health crisis brought me right back to a similar moment I shared in Afghanistan, and the mother and father T-Rex nuzzling were real, unlike the other 99% of the movie). Eli also had a couple of genuinely funny lines delivered with great comedic timing, despite the script. Otherwise, the movie was irredeemable. I wouldn't even watch it on streaming.The fact that it was only playing at the local Regal, the most expensive theater north of NYC, made it hurt that I wasted an evening with my wife on this. I wanted to see a great action/sci-fi/horror movie set in the Vietnam conflict. I watched one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was 1% better than the latest Jurassic World dog pile because of those precious moments where I actually connected with this movie. But that's not saying much! Cheers,\nMark W.",

            "review": "\"Kingdom\" (2025) is a film that ultimately struggles to captivate, despite a truly terrific and excellent performance from Vijay Deverakonda. While Deverakonda delivers on his promise of a strong portrayal, the film's narrative execution, particularly in its storytelling and screenplay, falls significantly short of making it an engaging cinematic experience.Vijay Deverakonda is undoubtedly the film's greatest asset. He carries the movie with his intense screen presence and delivers a compelling performance that stands out. His dedication to the role is evident, and he proves his capabilities even when the material around him falters.However, the core narrative of \"Kingdom\" feels underdeveloped and lacks a cohesive flow. The storytelling struggles to maintain momentum, making it difficult for the audience to stay invested in the plot. The screenplay appears to be one of the film's major weaknesses, preventing the story from unfolding in a consistently engaging manner. This leads to parts of the film feeling rather average and failing to capture the viewer's full attention.While the film may boast impressive visuals or a strong background score (as per other reviews), these elements are ultimately overshadowed by the uninspired plot and its execution. The lack of a gripping narrative arc means that even the high points don't land with the impact they should.Overall, \"Kingdom\" (2025) is a film that might appeal to fans of Vijay Deverakonda, who delivers a noteworthy performance. However, its weak story narration and unengaging screenplay prevent it from being a truly satisfying or memorable cinematic outing.",

But from the get-go, the storytelling feels a bit patchy, and by the time the second half arrives, the film begins to lose steam completely. Many scenes feel flat, emotions don't land as intended, and the narrative never really builds momentum. The climax is just about okay-neither satisfying nor disappointing, just safely passable.Vijay Devarakonda is a talented actor who has delivered few brilliant performances in the past and a few that fell short but this stands out to be his weakest performance to date.Satya Dev also brings a grounded intensity to his role.Bhagyashree looks fine, but her acting doesn't rise above average-it might be time she explores more glamorous roles that play to her strengths.The rest of the cast are serviceable and do their job without any major highs or lows.On the brighter side, the technical departments shine. The production values are impressive-locations are picturesque, sets and props are tastefully designed, and the costumes and makeup are neatly done. The cinematography is rich and adds visual appeal, while the background score enhances a few key moments, though it doesn't stay memorable. Two of the fight sequences stand out with slick choreography and decent buildup-they offer some of the film's rare bursts of energy.The direction doesn't falter entirely, but it doesn't elevate the film either. With a sharper script and more emotional depth, this could have been a far more engaging watch. As it stands, it's a film that plays it safe and ends up being just about tolerable. Not a must-watch by any means, but if the trailers caught your eye or you're a loyal Vijay Devarakonda fan, it might just pass the time.",

Or maybe it was my adrenaline rushing when two 12 year old were attacked by velociraptors.  It might possibly be the chills that went down my spine when the T-Rex first made his terrifying roar.  Whatever it was, it made me write this review.Allan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie (Laura Dern) are two successful paleontologists who are asked by a rich man John Hammond to come at his park for a major tour.  They agree and are taken to an island where \"Jurassic Park\" logos are everywhere.  The two paleontologists have no idea what they are getting themselves into.  The first dinosaur to make an apearance is the Brachiosaurus, which both of them are extrememly amazed by its giant apearance, and so is the audience.  What the two of them don't know is that there are much more terrifying and carnivorous dinosaurs who are about to escape and run loose....Directed by the mighty Steven Speilberg, Jurassic Park relied on more character development than any other creature-feature.  Usually you get second-rate actors who can't act, getting terrified by monsters that don't really exist.  Jurassic Park was the opposite.  It changed the way we looked at the world, and it will forever.  Based on the novel by Micheal Crichton, Jurassic Park was an amazing movie.From beginning to end, Jurassic Park bedazzled us with dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs that are EXTINCT.  There are a lot of cool cameos and the stars give great performances.  The whole family should watch this movie.  Not for the glossy title, but because of the dinosaurs.  I remember being a kid when I first watched it, and I remember loving this movie so bad.  The climax was excellent, and I am not saying what happens, unlike the sequel to this film (Jurassic Park 3).  A climax-less bad film, that was.  But this....this was magic.  And yes, it was a masterpiece.The magic of this film is what brought me into dinosaurs, too.  I had a \"Jurassic Park\" marathon today and I watched this movie, and I can still feel the magic.  You will feel the magic too once you see it.  I just have absolutely nothing to say except that Steven Speilberg will put a spell on you.  Even if you don't like creature-features, this movie will entertain you.  Steven Speilberg will take you to places that no one else ever will. And the \"life will find a way\" speech is here, ready to make someone feel that creating dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years is a good thing.Absolutely needless to say, Jurassic Park was a golden diamond.10/10 (One of the greatest films ever made)",

Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.The plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn't seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn't the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.This is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn't even in the top 250. Today, people don't appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90's, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn't understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.This spawned two sequels. The second one wasn't bad, but the third wasn't very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.The story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone's life is at stake.The special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.Younger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren't scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.I highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.Watch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.Enjoy",

True, it is the fourth highest grossing movie ever (for the time being) and was a motion picture bible for eight-year-olds across the country, but it has never been regarded as artistically superior. When, in reality, it is one of the most artistically inventive movies ever. It contains all of Spielberg's magical strokes of genius from fantastic art direction and wonderful camera techniques to astounding technical quality ( which comes from his well known control over technology). The minor flaws of a theme park are masterfully embedded into the art direction, script etc. and the acting is superb. This is one of the only movies I've seen with great acting by children. Spielberg's camera usage ranges from foreshadowing the appearance of dinosaurs with extreme up-angles to exquisitely composed scenes of the dinosaurs' \"interaction\" with the characters. Aside from technical quality, Jurassic Park bears powerful social messages of human intrusion and destruction of natural environment and the self-revering nature of man. Also, it had an undeniable effect on cinema being one of the first movies to use CGI at such a large scale. However, the most ingenious aspect of the film is the portrayal of the dinosaurs as animals rather than ruthless monsters. At many times throughout the movie, the humans are portrayed as antagonists and the respect and appreciation of the dinosaurs is wonderfully developed. And, best of all, like star wars you can analyze the movie all you want or just sit back and enjoy the ride.",

Also, if there's anything that can match the awesome T-Rex, it's the movie's musical score. I swear, listen to it more than once, and you're bound to see the movie yet again, if for that sole reason. It's that powerful. Oh sure, acting isn't this movie's strong suit, but who looks for acting in a Dinosaur thriller? Who?!Anyway, I think I've made my point. Jurassic Park: One of America's greatest classics. Steven Spielberg created magic with this movie. If you haven't seen it once, you haven't seen it at all.",

Sam Neill plays Dr Alan Grant, a paleontologist who is persuaded to check out Richard Attenborough's new theme park, only to find that he has managed to clone dinosaurs.  There is plenty of action, and the dinos look so real as to be positively scary!  Sam Neill puts in his usual incredibly brilliant performance, and you can really believe he is acting with the creatures!  Jeff Goldblum as usual seems to play himself, as Professor Ian Malcolm, an expert in chaos theory who is convinced the park is a bad idea.  The cast are amazing, the effects are amazing, this whole movie is amazing.  It doesn't get any better than this!",

Great casting, decent acting, great special effects, beautiful and perfect score by John Williams, incredible directing. I believe this movie has to be one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Although not entirely true to the book, (though someone should never say a movie is not good because it is not exactly like the book because that really doesn't matter) Steven Spielberg made this story a landmark in special effects and a standard for thriller films to be compared to. It also contains some scenes that are instant classics, such as the first time they see the dinosaurs, the kitchen scene with the raptors, the end scene with the raptors and the T-Rex, the scene with the T-Rex and the kids in the jeep, and of course the scene where the T-Rex chases the jeep. I will keep this movie in my list of favorites and classics till the day i die.",

I was eleven when I read the book, but all the technical stuff lost me and I never finished it. A couple years later when I heard the movie was coming out, I decided I would just see it instead. With advance tickets selling out fast, my mom was lucky enough to get some a few days before it's premiere. We stood in line for roughly thirty minutes before we finally got in. Even as the lights were dimming, I still had no idea what to expect. Within moments I was glued to my seat. The opening sequences remains one of my favorite scenes in any film and continues to give me goosebumps to this day. For the next two hours, I sat in my seat just staring at the screen as these marvelous, life-like creatures that were unlike anything I had ever seen before. The film was full of awe and scares. I walked out of the theater virtually trying to catch my breath. What a thrill ride the film had been, and I eventually went back and saw it a few more times. The film was a turning point in my life, as I said, because I walked out saying to myself, \"That's what I want to do.\" Sure the characters aren't deep and the dialogue isn't great, but who cares when the film is this entertaining? The actors are good in their parts, especially the always great Sam Neill, and the dinosaurs are incredibly life-like. The action is great, and the pacing (after a slow start) is relentless. The film has a few continuity flaws, but none of them matter. This film is great entertainment.",

I even had a backpack with a Velociraptor head sticking out of it for school. It was such an amazing achievement as a movie itself and the film is so wonderfully done that there's no doubt of why it has held up as long as it has and will remain the best dinosaur film ever created.The dinosaurs in this film look more realistic than any other prehistoric film, or even most movies today that try to pass off crappy CGI has reality. The acting was spectacular, and aside from how wonderful the creatures look and how vicious and exciting they were like no other dinosaur film had had them before, the plot and characters were solid and incredibly entertaining where you didn't think they would be so amusing.I will have to say again that one really huge reason why most people loved this movie was because of the special effects, but here again, isn't that an accomplishment in itself? Having your audience enjoy the film because of how realistic and fresh you are able to make it feel and look? I have never seen another movie with better effects than this one, ever. I am sure none of these horrible effects dinosaur movies that have been coming out lately could ever live up to the greatness of Jurassic Park.I am always going to love Jurassic Park for it's witty, unbelievable maneuvers and incredible screenplay though, as well. It was so properly thought out and executed, where most might have been expecting it to be nothing but high levels of adrenaline rushes with brainless action, which there was pulsating action, it just certainly wasn't as mindless. Many who dislike Jurassic Park really just have all the same reasons the average movie-goer would have for disliking a film, yet I haven't heard anyone fully describe and explain, well, what they truly thought were faults with this film, which gives me reason to believe that Jurassic Park is a masterpiece, for I, myself, have no faults with this film, except that I have seen other films that I enjoyed more. . . just a little more.",

While some of the exclusively digital dinosaurs don't hold up quite as well as the rest (despite having been only relatively recently surpassed by their peers - depending on budgetary constraints, of course), there are times when the superb CG almost seamlessly blends with possibly the best practical effects I've ever seen to create phenomenally believable, groundbreaking special-effects that truly are, still to this day, some of the best of their kind. Seriously, both the Raptor rigs and, specifically, the to-scale T-Rex are nothing short of breathtaking. They work so well not only due to the flick's fantastic technical prowess but also thanks to its beautiful blending of its core techniques (those created by clay and those by computer), its legitimate reactions from the compelling characters and its uncanny ability to put the audience right in the middle of it all, making you feel genuine wonder, fear, suspense and elation as if you're really sat alongside these long-extinct creatures. It's difficult to stress just how important the characters are in making it all so utterly believable, as well as so utterly captivating. Each of them feel like fleshed-out people, written to perfection by screenwriters who know how to get information across to the audience in a very organic way. It's almost as entertaining watching these people just converse with one another, discussing the morals of bringing extinct creatures back from the dead, as it is seeing them navigate the survival situation in which they are inevitably placed. It is only because we care so much about all the core players that the suspense sequences work so well, that we are kept on the edge of our seat every time a dinosaur lurks around the corner and that we grip our chairs when they leap for their prey. These scenes are some of the best in cinema, perfectly constructed with restraint and splendour. It's also difficult to describe how affecting even the simple moments can be, the moments in which we are asked to sit back and stare at the mere sight of a dinosaur. These should have dampened with time and yet they haven't, still eliciting the awe they did when they first hit the big-screen. They emulate the imagined magic of seeing one of these animals in real life for the first time. Running underneath all of this are some compelling themes that eagerly invite analysis, with the central debate being a tough and intriguing one. The picture is simply one of the most engaging I've ever seen, one that puts an ear-to-ear smile on your face just because it's so utterly amazing. It balances all of its core tenants impeccably, being a proper 'summer blockbuster' that's incredibly intelligent as well, to the point that every second is just supreme entertainment. It can make you lean forward in your seat or well-up with awe and, in general, have a blast from beginning to end. The movie is, without a doubt, a true masterpiece. 10/10",

The acting is the worst I've seen in any movie of the last 20 years. By definition, paleontologists mainly study geology of past periods, rather than biology. Thus, we can deduct that the main characters would be more surprised, or make more mention of- the dinosaurs physiological and anatomical attributes such as skin and eye color, body temperature, sounds, and overall appearance. The lumber some walking and bobbing of heads that Hollywood often adopts for dinosaurs is highly uncommon in modern cold blooded reptiles. Even the giant Gila Monsters move swiftly with grace and dexterity. The dramatic human like personalities of the dinosaurs is another purely Hollywood stunt. Yes, velociraptors may have the physiological ability to open a door, but without human reasoning, they wouldn't know \"why\" to open one. The biggest underlying question throughout the movie is \"why?\". Why do the dinosaurs want to kill? Why aren't the characters more surprised and ask more questions? Why are there kids on the island? Why did the director let so many slip-ups pass through the final cut? Why did the boy survive a 10,000 volt electric shock?

The special effects are fantastic and each scene has a special tension and effect of its own.  Spielberg weaves a magic web and pleases everyone in the process.  He puts in a few things here and there to please the more liberal in the audience as well as the more traditional.  He even sends messages to the critics with words such as sexism to try and appease the media critics.Spielberg also has us rooting against every one who dies and for everyone who lives.  He even gets the audience to laugh hysterically while a person is torn apart.  In fact a number of people complained that there was not enough gore in Jurassic Park 3.  If you are looking for gore than you will get much more with this film than with JP3.  There was a more gritty tone with this film than with JP3. We got to see cows and other animals eaten alive in detail. But beyond the appeasement of those who need to be convinced of realism through gore and other methods, it is with action that Spielberg excels.  Fantastic use of sound and special effects make this film a thrilling event.  Spielberg has shown he is the king of action even on the small budget of Duel.  I was reminded of the terror invoked through the shaking of the ground and the loud sounds of a dinosaur walking.Jurassic Park was about terror and fear while JP3 was about adventure.  JP3 was a thrll ride in which the audience wishes it was on the island while Jurassic Park we were more in a state of fear.  JP3 was full of imagination and excitement and we really cared about the characters.  The smart kid in JP1 was more enjoyable than the crying kids in JP1.  Those who say he could not have survived because teenagers are dumb would probably be the same ones who at one time said women were unable to do anything.  Anyway JP3 was just an adventure that really found redeeming value in every character where JP1 just killed off all the creeps. I was also reminded that Jurassic Park was a statement movie.  The statement being that people should not clone creatures or try and create monsters similar to the ideas in Frankenstein.  JP3 was more like Dracula in that it had no real statement.  JP3 was really about whether or not the characters would escape with their son similar to whether or not one could survive a night in Dracula's castle.  So JP3 was more of a good old fashioned scary adventure and about imagination.  It really depends on what you like.  JP3 also was at a disadvantage being the second sequel but was still very exciting.  Personally, I give a slight edge to JP3 because I just enjoyed it more, though it definately could have been a little longer and would have been even better had Jeff Goldblum been in it.",

Pete Davidson is not one of these people. There needs to be immense skill and a sense of focus that turns a loveable character actor into a terror and sadly we're treated to lots of close ups of Pete's face looking blank, bored, confused, constipated and spaced out rather than the tumult of emotions he needs to express.His line delivery is wooden and unemotional and I got the impression of Billy the puppets from Saw and Dead Silence.This weak performance is highlighted in every scene when he is opposite an established actor such as John Glover, Ethan Phillips, Bruce Altman & Mary Beth Peil, which is almost every scene. They are effortless and embody their characters, believe what they are saying, no matter how ridiculous, and sell their lines with a mixture of talent, experience and craft that is the most fun parts of this movie.Sadly, all their characters exist only to move Pete's character through the plot and to be honest, the plot is a bit of a mess.A huge part of the horror is that old people are gross, illness is gross and old sick people are very gross and weird and crazy. Yawn.There's a big reveal that comes about two thirds of the way through for no reason other than to get us to the end of the film, the established plot is discarded with a handwave and we move on to Plot B.The final act would be fun if it didn't feel that it had been lifted poorly from The Substance and the resolution for two characters is literally random.I wasn't expecting much, given Pete Davidson's awful turn in Bodies, Bodies, Bodies and James DeMonaco's decrease in quality of The Purge films and I somehow still walked away disappointed.If you enjoy horror movies, skip this one. There's nothing new, nothing inventive and the most interesting performances total up to probably about ten minutes of the 95m runtime and having to stare at Pete's blank face while he plays a character better suited to an actor ten years younger that can modulate their voice at all is not worth the waste of 85m.",

            "review": "It turns out the scariest place to work isn't a haunted house or an abandoned asylum... it's a retirement home. James DeMonaco's The Home proves just that, delivering a slow-burn psychological horror experience that builds dread with every creaking hallway, awkward stare, and cryptic bedtime story told after dark. It's moody, gripping, and ultimately, unshakable, a horror film that knows how to get under your skin without resorting to cheap thrills.Pete Davidson shines. Ever since Bodies Bodies Bodies, he's been quietly redefining what kind of roles he can handle, and The Home might be his best work yet. He plays Max, a troubled man sent to work at a retirement facility as part of a community service sentence. Max is sarcastic and detached, but there's pain behind his eyes, and Davidson walks the line between dark comedy and genuine fear with surprising skill. His performance feels grounded, especially as the story spirals into madness.The setup could've been generic... \"guy works in creepy place, spooky stuff happens\" but DeMonaco, best known for The Purge series, infuses the film with a claustrophobic sense of paranoia. You can feel the walls closing in around Max as the residents' cryptic comments grow weirder and the staff becomes increasingly suspicious. And unlike 2023's The Rule of Jenny Pen (a retirement home horror film that dragged like it had arthritis), The Home knows how to pace itself. Every chapter pushes the mystery forward, no filler, no wheel-spinning, just a steady build toward something chilling and earned.The supporting cast is a huge asset. John Glover, as a disturbingly charming resident, delivers a performance that's as enigmatic as it is unnerving. Bruce Altman adds quiet menace as one of the staff, the kind of guy who's always just too helpful. The film doesn't go for over-the-top monsters or gore, this is a psychological horror that plays in the shadows, thriving on uncertainty, whispers, and the ever-present fear that Max might be losing his grip on reality.Visually, the film is drenched in muted tones and sickly yellows, echoing the sterile, fading world of the retirement home. Dream sequences bleed into reality so fluidly you start to question what's real right alongside Max. The sound design adds to the tension: distant cries, shuffling footsteps at night, the hum of fluorescent lights that feel like they're watching you.The Home is a taut, eerie, and emotionally charged psychological horror film that doesn't just entertain-it lingers. Pete Davidson continues to prove his range, and James DeMonaco crafts a story that's rich with atmosphere and tension. This might be one of the year's biggest surprises, and easily one of the strongest horror entries of 2025 so far.",

This is a movie that starts slow, granted the camera work and editing in the first 10 mins might be confusing to some, but once the ground work for the story is done, albeit slowly and somewhat boring, then comes the punch and shock in the second half. The second half especially the climax fight scenes and the eventual revelation is totally worth sitting through the movie. I walked out with so much joy and what a unique horror movie.

Add a goofy Pete Davidson here and some very off putting content and you've got one of the most original horror movies.It's hard not to give spoilers here but let's just say it's one of the craziest big reveals I've seen in a movie. Who are the senior citizens and what is it they want? Plus what's up with the forbidden spot in the home? Pete Davidson adds some humor to his role but at the same time does vulnerability well.What exactly are the secrets being held is a mystery. Slowly we are introduced to not only creepy folks but unusual circumstances connected to our hero on a personal level.I promise you the big reveal and mystery is worth it! Pete Davidson does a decent job as a conflicted character with little to no direction in life. Horror movie lovers will love it!",

I mostly know Pete Davidson from SNL, and his dating life, so it was interesting to see him in a horror movie. The first 2/3rds of the movie are paced very strange and has a lot of odd things that happen that make you question what is going on. The end third of the movie answers some of the questions, but this is what the true enjoyment of the movie came in for me. The end of this movie was insane, funny, brutal, and had some pretty great twists that FINALLY made this movie worth watching.There is some random Horror thrown throughout the building half of this movie using body horror and a few scenes that make next to no sense.A lot of this movie feels like a Thriller because of the surrounding mystery and tension that builds up until some of the reveals.All in all, this movie is fine, and has some entertainment value, but I would recommend watching this film at home when it comes out on streaming and not making a trip out to spend the money in the theater.",

I did love the twists in this one, but I just found it to be a little too out there overall. I might have gave this a higher rating if it wasnt for the rooftop scene.

Then you have most giving it a lot less and after just watching it, I say the 5.5 is gravely misgiven. People need to watch more films, because they clearly don't understand quality when it stares them in the \"eye\".While yes it isn't a 10 to me, I get why people would feel that way. Too many reviews and too many trailers tell people too much. That is why I gave up on doing lots or research before I watch stuff. I figure if it is at least 4.4 or above I'll give it a shot. You can be surprised how much quality you can find when you go in open minded.I watched this, going in only knowing it was Pete Davidson. I wasn't impressed because I saw some stuff from him that tainted my feelings. I'm glad I gave this a shot. Holy crap it really is so good. This tells a story in such a great way. I don't want to give anything away so I can't fully articulate why it is so good, because even warning about something, makes you get preconceived notions. It is best to go into this with an open mind and be in the mood for some twisted stuff. It is graphic in the best possible way. It really pushes and delivers. I laughed at the jump scares, but trust me, they are used and obvious for a reason. It really made me drop my guard and figure it was more stupid garbage that rely heavily on jump scares and poor writing. That is so far from the case here.That was the happiest happy ending I've watched in sometime, and I was smiling very hard by the time the credits rolled. I was very vocal in my wtf!?! That I boisterously exclaimed as the movie plowed on. It starts out slow, I guess. It isn't as slow start as I'm used to seeing when people say that. It is only a matter of minutes, because the writing of the characters and the way the story is told with the cinematography, it really had me hooked like a tow truck. It doesn't take long for the crazy to start creeping in. By the time you've noticed the overt you might have a little time to think back on things and see the way it's been creeping on ya all along. It really is that good and one of the strongest newer horror movies released this year and much of last. I was last surprised by Dead Mail, and I loved it, but this definitely takes the cake for unexpected surprised enjoyment. I also feel it's great to have someone to watch it with because as the stuff starts to spiral, it's fun to hear the reactions.",

Well, it turns out that was a blessing in disguise when Warner Bros. Booked him for a slot of this movie and months later, he was reemployed by the giant-sized company for GOTG 3 and he just killed two heroes with one stone. 2021's The Suicide Squad is indeed, THE Suicide Squad that we all deserve!The most outstanding thing about this latest squad is the way they blend and mix in everything into the recipe. It's like you're watching a bunch of genres; comedy, dark comedy, fantasy, action, thriller, drama, superhero, spoof and commentaries; political, social contexts, world revolving issues all together and yet, it tastes très bon! Often enough, movies that try to do everything together fail big time but not this one. This is a cinematic achievement.James Gunn, who also directed Guardians of the Galaxy, knew that the Marvel/DC films have rehashed their materials multiple times; basic origin, romance, giving up, final battle. Hence, Gunn develops a non-formulaic approach that seems suicidal at first but triumphantly creates something unique and unpredictable. From the get-go, Gunn's vision is unconventional but polished, enough to make the audience feels they have never seen anything like it before.Talking about unpredictability, it indeed is what it is. You never know what will come next, who will die or survive. There are a few times that Gunn uses the head fake technique to deceive viewers from its sequential but engaging storytelling. Like Deadpool, something unexpected happens at the moment when you least expect it.The juxtaposition of both the 2016's and 2021's is evidently visible. While 2016 has its moments, almost everyone could agree it was disappointingly bland af. The 2021 entry has a strong direction and far better pacing, let alone twists that are fully captivating. The only couple of things that 2016 did it better were the trailers and the soundtrack.The Rated-R is straight up hardcore to the face. It's superbly gory, darkly comical and unabashedly funny, all without pulling its punches. This is how DC films should be, not as dour as Zack Snyder's but not as light as Marvel's either.When it comes to flaws, albeit its powerful opening scene, I feel that they waste many of the potential characters here insofar some of them never even got the chance to show their abilities, skills, talents or superpowers.I am also not impressed by the intensity of the movie's brightness particularly on the background in some scorching white scenes. It defaces the texture of the film and should dazzle some viewers, left distorting of what could have been an iconic scene like the slo-mo segment.All in all, 2021's The Suicide Squad makes for a suicidal task with flamboyantly sheer colourful characters that collectively sign up for one thing amidst this pandemic chaos; blasting out loud the volume of fun and violence, subsequently climbing to the top as the best DCEU Film ever made.",

No hate towards David Ayer, the studios definitely meddled with his film to the max, I would LOVE to see his version but nonetheless, what we got was such a terrible film.... Fast forward 5 years & Warner Brothers turns the tables and makes what is probably one of the GREATEST comic book movies of all time. The film is very ballsy, violent & full of heart. The characters are eye candy & I'm VERY happy that James Gunn kept what worked in the original. Because it was a bad movie but there were some good in it. This film James really respects David Ayers film by keeping what worked while just sticking to what needed to be done. The R Rating was needed, I'm also glad the studio acknowledged that. I'm VERY Tired of seeing studios go for a PG-13 rating so they can get more views. Like cmon now, grow a pair please. Sony doing it with Venom & all other types of examples of studios fearing the R Rating... I think ever since Joker Warner Brothers has discovered that they can really get the same numbers if not more regardless, Then Birds Of Prey happened, which I enjoyed too. BUT my point is ALL of this led up to this movie RIGHT HERE. So again, kudos to Warner Brothers for the R Rating!!! Now first things first, The action is GREAT & the twists are even more magnificent. The Comedy is SPOT ON, and lands when it needs to, the use of dark comedy and balance of character development is done so well that it doesn't feel out of place or that one is taking over the other. BloodSport carry's this movie, his performance was SCREAMING Will Smith for me, (meaning the role just looks like it was meant for him because he had daughter issues too) but I gotta say, Idris Elba grew on me more than Will Smith did. His performance is GREAT and he has amazing chemistry with another character and it just feels special. Polka Dot man was absolutely hilarious yet gave me a bittersweet taste in my mouth, but in a good way. King Shark was an amazing joy to watch on screen. Peacemaker was awesome too. Now what I mean by awesome is off their importance, performance and role in the movie. Some of these characters are not like able... mind you... and some things will happen over the course of events and make you not like characters more and that's where this movie shines. It's VERY unpredictable. And when you feel like you think you know where the movie is going it pulls the rug from under you hard. Very enjoyable ride. When it was over I wanted to watch it again.*Pros*\nWell written characters / performances\nComedy/Action (is not repetitive)\nEffects/CGI\nStory / plot / script*Cons*\nThinly written Villain\nClimax for the ending felt just a bit thin wish it would have required more \"teamwork\" and not one character being the reason they won (you'll see what I mean)\nSome Characters I felt died a bit too soon and would have liked a little more depth before they went.WB needs to keep this up and we will continue to want more. If they understand the character they should know the direction needed to continue the character. Superman doesn't need to be dark and suicide squad should never be PG13. Not saying these are \"impossible to do\" but just saying if you REALLY understand the character you should know what works and what doesn't, and as far as I see it... this is the RIGHT direction for The Suicide Squad Peacemaker show is something to look forward to! And I will be more than happy to call this Film an \"The REAL Academy Winning Suicide Squad\" because it deserves the title more than the 2016 one... #releasetheayercut.",

James Gunn struck gold with the first Guardians of the Galaxy, and the attempt to repeat that formula is apparent here - only it's amped up to the nth degree. The plot, if one can call it that, is one long exercise in subverting expectations. But Gunn is no M. Night Shymalan and no Monty Python either. This is pure randomness and lack of structure masquerading as subversiveness and edginess. I found myself reminded of the old Ren & Stimpy cartoon show at times, the bad later seasons, not the good early ones. Trying so hard to be edgy that it just becomes cringe worthy.This film reeks of studio desperation. It's Homer's makeup shotgun from the Simpsons in movie form. A bizarre, unfocused and pitiful smear of concepts, moods and sounds.Speaking of sound, the use of music in this film is awful. Different genres of songs are used randomly like in a late 90s Tarantino rip off. Most of the pop songs don't even work with what's happening on screen. Harley's escape is such a case. Frequently the score is interrupted full stop by sound fx or jokes. Again another attempt at \"subverting expectations\" and a simple trick at that. People expect music to go on, so when it's suddenly interrupted, they feel surprised. It's a dumb man's clever movie.It's not entirely without merit. Some of the photography is nice. Some of the acting performances are good (Polka Dot man, Idris Elba, the Shark and Rat Girl stand out) and some are awful (the villains, the nerds in front of the computer screens who do nothing but comment on things). Some of the character interactions are funny. Most are not.The first 20 minutes are amusing. The movie grinds to a painful halt in the middle and never regains its momentum. It's one exceedingly long, constantly interrupted, unfocused stew. Worst of all is the blatant disrespect this film has for its audience.I compare Marvel movies to fast food. Simple, safe, unhealthy junk food for the brain with very few nutrients. This is worse. This is vomit cooked up with artificial flavoring and sold as haute cuisine to people without taste buds.Bad as the original Suicide Squad was, this made me nostalgic for it.",

But just wait a few more minutes, you'll just shock and then you'll never want it to be end. You'll say I want more. The actions were so unique and dramatic. I loved the chemistry between the characters especially Bloodsport and his daughter( and it was far better than deadshot & his daughter's story from the first movie).

            "review": "Before I talk about the film, let me talk a bit about DCEU. The difference between DC and Marvel (and why Marvel is more successful than DC) is the people behind them. The people/company behind Marvel (Disney) know and plan everything. They even planned this whole MCU thing ever since 2008's Iron Man. They know what they are doing, where they are heading with their characters, stories, and films, and how to do them and write them right. That's why their Universe is more successful. But, for DC the people/company behind it (Warner Bros.) are ruining this beautiful universe that's filled with great characters by bringing the wrong people to direct/write their movies which brings chaos to the films and world of the DCEU. Or they create issues with the right director like Zack Snyder (which we all saw how he was building that big/creative universe in Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) and where it was going). However, this time DC choses James Gunn to write & direct this film which if you're not familiar with, he directed Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 (2014) and Vol. 2 (2017). And this is the second proof (after Snyder's) that when having the right person/people behind a film, they will kill it. And THIS IS HOW \"The SUICIDE SQUAD\" STORY SHOULD LOOK LIKE. And that's all thanks to James Gunn.So happy that the film got an R rating because the suicide squad story should be like that. It should be full of blood, comedy, craziness, violence, disgusting action scenes, and curse words. Thank god they didn't care about the film being PG 13+ or whatever so more people could see it. And I feel like James Gunn was behind that part. It's not a suicide squad film if there were no sexual, bloody, violent, and disgusting content.The cinematography was beyond amazing and the film presented some new ideas. Like, in one scene (dw no spoilers) two characters were fighting and we were seeing it through the reflection of a helmet. Or in a specific fight scene, instead of \"blood\" coming out of the bodies, it was \"flowers\" which made the 3 or 5 min action sequence very colorful and fun to watch. The camera movements were also great and felt that they sometimes were steady handheld which was so unique. Also loved how the film picks slow motion in certain times only to show the chaos that's happening around and they were very limited which is a good thing.For the third time, Margot Robbie proves that she is the best portrayal of Harley Quinn and I cannot imagine anyone other than her as Harley Quinn. She presents the beauty, craziness, and wildness of the character. Idris Alba really surprised me. His character was very well written and Idris played it so right. The real surprise was John Cena. Personally, I don't like Cena's acting. But, in this film his acting was alright and the thing that helped him is how good his character (Peacemaker) is written. Especially that Peacemaker has a huge impact on the story of the film and the future of DCEU. Daniela Melchior gave the film such a warm/soft vibe and her acting was well done especially in the emotional scenes. The whole cast was just amazing and each actor/actress played their role perfectly.Really loved the music in the film. And if you have seen Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) you'd know that it has the same style/vibe. The costumes were brilliant and loved how James kept the original costume of each character from the comics which made the film/character even more special & real. Also, loved how the film jumps back in time suddenly to explain where a specific character is or how things ended up that way and there was something different about it which I can't tell what it is.My rating is 8/10\nWATCHED: in an IMAX Theatre.",

It seems that this movie struggled with the genre it belonged to and the issues with David Ayer's version were actually exacerbated in this. I do think it was very well shot and it was creative, however, I think the writing was a let down. The humour did not work in this film, the jokes fell flat and they did not have the intended effect which is why it feels like a film struck between two genres. It would be best described as an action comedy, however, considering the comedic aspect of the film failed, what we were left with was a mediocre action film. What made Guardians successful was the ability to combine the humour and the action in an organic way but it seems that James Gunn failed in this movie to do that.The characters were written quite well and they were likeable which was one aspect that I enjoyed and they had their own identity which shined through. The characters were not forgettable like in 2016 and it did make the film bearable. The plot itself was quite generic and it felt that nothing was at stake. While this is perhaps the intent, it did not make the audience care much for what was going on.I do think the subplot of Luna was both bizzare and unnecessary. It added nothing of value, neither in the story nor character development. Perhaps it did add a bit for Harley but it felt very out of place.The background of a corrupt south American regime did seem too heavy and it felt like it was shoehorned in by the US government to reinforce how being against the US government is evil and those who oppose the US foreign policy are malicious people with ulterior motives.Once all these elements are combined, it really is quite an incoherent film. The humour and action do not fit together organically, the jokes fall flat, the idea of a corrupt regime did not fit well with the genre, it was like combining two different films, nothing felt at stake, and the way the villain was defeated felt childish and odd.It's mediocre in my opinion.

The casting itself was also really well done with Daniela Melchior being the standout to me.Overall I loved this movie, it was such a breath of fresh air in, at times, today's over saturated superhero movie genre and I would highly recommend that people go see this film in cinemas for a truly unforgettable experience.",

I feel like the film makers took on criticism from the first movie and put improvements into this. To me, this was basically like an Avengers movie aimed at adults with violence, gore and swearing.The film is filled with a great cast who all do a terrific job, especially Margot Robbie, I couldn't see anyone else doing the role of Harley Quinn. She is to Harley what Heath Ledger was to the joker. The movie is filled with funny one liners and never takes itself too seriously. I felt the first Suicide Squad was bordering too much pretty humour and seriousness and wasn't sure what it was. This reboot blends humour and seriousness perfectly. Some of the scenes between John Cena and Idris Elba were hilarious, as well as the lines from King Shark.I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this to be honest based on the first film, but this delivers exactly what you would expect from a team of anti-heroes, it's funny, entertaining and aimed at a mature audience, and for me it's an 8/10.",

I also really hoped we'd get to see Hailie and their relationship, which we all know is beautiful and so strong.\"Mockingbird\" is my favorite song, and sadly it wasn't mentioned (aside from a brief fan comment).Still, the two hours flew by, and I know I could've easily watched two more.I was born in 2001, when Eminem was already a huge sensation. That didn't stop me from falling in love with every track, even the ones released before I was born. I've been listening to him since I was very young - at first without fully understanding anything.But after his darkest period (following Proof's death), when he came back with \"Not Afraid,\" that's when I truly became a fan.I've never been to one of his concerts, and I'm still waiting - beyond excited - for him to announce a tour.

We looked up to Eminem as representatives of people who looked like us in the hip hop culture . His lyrics were bar none the best out there. He was better than Jay-Z who at the time was considered the top rapper. It's always debatable, but what wasn't was that Eminem was on fire and his first couple of albums were just ridiculous from beginning to end really. This documentary is cool and more sappy really than anything else. I know he cleaned up but I really feel like he went liberal and woke like many other rich and famous entertainers and movie stars over the last 5 years. He became someone who I don't really believe he is. I dont believe half these Hollywood elite snobs actually believe or live the nonsense they pretend to stand for now. I think they are all scared to get cancelled and now that woke is dead they just scared to look like sellouts so they stick with the BS.

That balance made the film feel authentic, raw, and deeply human.It could have been a self-indulgent victory lap, but instead, Stan is about connection, identity, and what it means when an artist becomes a voice for millions.

            "review": "'The Phoenician Scheme (2025)' is, unsurprisingly, unmistakably a Wes Anderson movie. At this point, a \"Wes Anderson movie\" is almost a genre in and of itself. I'm pretty sure the quirky writer-director could do this in his sleep by now, and it kind of feels like that's what he's been doing recently. He consistently churns out films with no real theme or narrative drive or even reason to exist other than to suitably fit into the twee style he has curated over his career, crafting experiences that are ostensibly style as substance but often feel closer to all style and no substance. What I mean is that where his earlier films felt as though he was using his style to tell a specific and meaningful story, his more recent efforts feel like he is fitting a story into his style. He comes up with quaint nonsense that can be easily configured into the still-pleasing shape all his work takes, putting very little into things like theme or character or emotion. His work is starting to get a tiny bit tedious because it feels like he's simply going through the motions, never really challenging himself or using his specific talents to do anything other than the same thing he's been doing for years. That's not to imply that his newest stuff is bad, as they're just as good as any of his holistically more successful efforts from a formal and technical point of view, but they do lack a certain essentiality that makes them feel ever-so-slightly ho-hum. His latest feature - a business-centred pseudo satirical comedy starring a deadpan Benicio Del Toro, a commanding Mia Threapleton and an absurd Michael Cera, alongside a litany of famous faces both familiar and new - is a perfectly serviceable effort, filled with plenty of visual delight and enjoyable eccentricities. It's undeniable Anderson has complete control of his craft, capable of finely tuning his oxymoronically homogeneous idiosyncrasies so they still enchant even if they no longer surprise. However, it's sort of expected at this point that he can - and will - deliver something like this to this level of quality, which has the unfortunate side-effect of dampening the effectiveness - or, at least, novelty - of his cinematic prowess. The strength of his direction and the specificity of his writing aren't as potent as they once were precisely because they've been at the same level for so long that they're part of the proverbial furniture at this point. Of course, taking excellence for granted isn't something that ought to be encouraged, but it's undeniably difficult to get excited about something we've seen so many times before. Plus, it doesn't help that nothing in this flick hasn't been done better before in one of Anderson's earlier efforts. To be fair, it isn't actually any worse than his previous few, at least formally and technically speaking. However, there is a sense that he's running out of steam - or, at least, resting on his laurels - and comfortably releasing self-eating snakes that are so specifically 'Wes Anderson' that they're almost parodies of actual 'Wes Anderson' films. Still, the movie is enjoyable enough for what it is. It's never boring, moves at a pleasant pace, is well-made in its every aspect, and also provokes a handful of chuckles. The problem is that it only ever connects so deeply, that it never truly moves or inspires. That's primarily because there's no real sense of emotion to it, despite it having a family-focused central arc, and it also isn't really about anything. It's a good effort, for sure, and will probably feel extremely refreshing if you aren't all that familiar with its directors work. It's just a little hard to get excited about something that honestly seems a bit perfunctory. Maybe that's too harsh a term, but it's certainly something that comes to mind as you watch the feature unfold. Again, it is entertaining and it is well-crafted. Its cast, most of whom are now veterans in this field, know exactly what to do with the dialogue they're given, and Wes Anderson's signature style is still fairly fun even after all this time. It isn't hilarious, but there are a handful of funny gags and even more mildly amusing moments, and the narrative is engaging for its entirety. By the same token, though it's only ever mildly amusing, never really getting out of second - or, potentially, third - gear and therefore feeling like one of its director's more minor efforts. It's good enough for what it is, and - again - is very confident and compelling when it comes to its form, but it's just lacking a certain something that's difficult to put my finger on. It's a solid effort, and I definitely don't regret seeing it, but it certainly isn't one of Anderson's best. It's inessential, but enjoyable nevertheless.",

And it's almost as silly.An incredible cast of actors is reduced to a series of bit-part cameos, which should be annoying, but I couldn't help thinking that it was probably enormous fun to make. And Bill Murray as God is without doubt one of my favourite ever bits of casting. The Tom Hanks and Bryan Cranston double act is a total hoot.So I certainly can't recommend it to everyone, but I will definitely recommend it to people who I think will get it.

            "review": "Many world-renowned auteurs with distinct styles take years between projects-filmmakers like Christopher Nolan, Kathryn Bigelow, or Steve McQueen. Wes Anderson is inarguably in league with them. Yet lately, he seems to be hurting his own legacy by producing too much, too quickly. In the past five years alone, he's released four feature films and four short films-including The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar (2023), which finally earned him his first Oscar. The latest in this near-annual output is The Phoenician Scheme (2025).The Phoenician Scheme tells the story of wealthy and maligned industrialist Zsa Zsa Korda (Benicio Del Toro), who, after surviving one too many assassination attempts by rivals, names his forgotten novitiate daughter Liesl (Mia Threapleton) as his sole heir-over his eight sons. Together with Liesl and his insect-obsessed secretary Bjorn (Michael Cera), he sets off to secure his magnum opus: a network of infrastructure projects in Phoenicia.Since Isle of Dogs (2018), Anderson's films have increasingly felt like cast reunions performing stylized imitations of his earlier work, rather than urgent artistic ventures. Both The French Dispatch (2021) and Asteroid City (2023) wandered through quirk without narrative drive-pleasant but aimless. His Roald Dahl short films, by contrast, felt stronger, largely because they stuck closer to plot, message, and character. In The Phoenician Scheme, Anderson attempts a return to plot, giving his aesthetic more structure and a clearer objective.Yet the story at the film's core feels creaky. It plays like a director trying to reawaken his own narrative instincts, so strong in weaving together tones and threads in The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) or The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). The Phoenician Scheme in contrast lacks emotional depth. It rarely moves beyond clever quips and fails to fully explore the father-daughter relationship central to the film. The political commentary, meanwhile, is blunt and didactic, sacrificing subtlety and impact in favor of heavy-handed messaging.Anderson has always toyed with caricature and cliché-it's part of his charm. But here, the self-awareness seems to have dulled. There are still magically hilarious moments where everything clicks-like a high-stakes basketball game featuring Tom Hanks and Bryan Cranston-but many other scenes come across as oblivious to their own hollow aphorisms and tropes.The cast, as ever, is impressive-and thankfully more curtailed than in recent ensemble-heavy efforts. This tighter scope allows for some character development. Newcomers Threapleton and Cera adapt well to Anderson's rapid-fire, deadpan style. Del Toro, however-despite being one of the most talented and underrated actors of the past few decades-feels miscast. His gritty, grounded style clashes with Anderson's hyper-stylized cadence. Del Toro seems out of sync, his performance feeling stiff and unnatural. Zsa Zsa doesn't come across as a genuine industrialist, but rather as someone pretending to be one.That said, Anderson's signature aesthetic remains intact. The film is visually immaculate, his humor still lands in places, and the editing maintains that conspiratorial wink to the audience. Wisely, Anderson pulls back from the exaggerated look of Asteroid City and The French Dispatch, which had begun to feel like parodies of his own work.Ultimately, The Phoenician Scheme corrects some of Anderson's recent missteps but still leaves viewers emotionally cold and narratively uninvested. The technical mastery is still there, and familiar faces remain endearing, but Del Toro's misaligned performance in such a pivotal role weakens the film's core. The result is a forgettable, if not unwelcome, addition to Anderson's unique filmography. One hopes the American director continues to pursue his singular style-but slows down and reinvests in story and heart next time around. There's no need to rush.",

But the main relationship between a high ranking corrupt tycoon and his estranged religious daughter never really feels like it hits that mark of deep emotional resonance.The Grand Budapest Hotel remains his magnum opus.

Despite this being the first Anderson film not to benefit from the master camerawork of Robert Yeoman the style is still very familiar and the use of props and stunningly created wardrobe are as much stars of the film as the many A-listers who make an appearance, no matter how brief. The dry wit of Richard Ayoade, one of Britain's smartest comedians, and Michael Cera particularly stand out.It's difficult not to see Benicio del Toro's empathy free, slave-owning, greedy oligarch character spawning children (mostly boys) with wives he has no relationship with as making some reference to some of today's real life characters, much like Isle of Dogs was used to make a subtle reference to the growing anti-immigration narrative when released around a decade ago, but like Isle of Dogs, the ending of the film leaves room for a positive interpretation of current turbulent times.",

I have always liked these pieces of music but to hear them together, in an up front way was special. I also loved Moonrise Kingdom for its extended use of Benjamin Britten.*End Credits - worth watching as they tastefully but playfully hold your attention.* Costumes and sets - as always of the highest quality\n* Colour Pallette - the most confectionary-like cinema has ever been; a mixture of stop animation, play within a film and situationist comedy.It's easy to dismiss Wes Anderson films as being all the same but if this were the only film he'd made it would easily be the best of the year so far.

            "review": "The Phoenician Scheme doesn't push Wes Anderson's usual tropes to the extreme like Asteroid City or The French Dispatch but it does end up doing just about everything you'd expect from one of his movies without any of the flair. The movie feels like it's on autopilot from the very first scenes and Anderson just ends up feeling like he's recycling his usual tropes to the effect of feeling so dull. I didn't hate this movie but I was amazed by how much of a chore it was to get through.Anderson's last few movies have been criticised for disappearing too far into his own style but I personally enjoyed the unique experiences those movies provided. The French Dispatch is his magnum opus in my opinion and even if I thought Asteroid City was too overwhelming at times I still liked how much it left me to chew on but that's not the case here at all. The story was painfully uninteresting to me and it's told in the flattest, more linear way imaginable. It's essentially a series of business negotiations for nearly the entire runtime and not only do they feel insanely repetitive but they often drag on far longer than necessary.I'm not really sure what Anderson's ultimate vision for this film because he doesn't really do anything behind the camera that we haven't seen from him before and his trademark humour really didn't work for me this time around. It's very deadpan with a lot of moments of quirkiness that just feel forced, it actually made me cringe more often than it didn't with the climax in particular feeling quite ridiculous. From a cinematography perspective it looks gorgeous and I really did feel like the performances were hitting the right notes but I just felt nothing. Most of the supporting characters just feel one noted and they end up feeling like quirks more than anything. Benicio Del Toro's character can be entertaining but he's just far too unlikable and never really felt like the script did much to redeem him by the time the film ends.The Phoenician Scheme is disappointingly flat in almost every way and for whatever criticisms people might have with Anderson's recent offerings at least they had the energy that I thought was sorely missing here. It's not a particularly interesting story with characters that never really peaked my interest at all and the few interesting gimmicks Anderson does use feel like they've been done by him before and better. There's almost surprises technically and it really did end up feeling like Anderson was trying to make one of his own movies. Anderson is very hit and miss for me and I can honestly say that this movie felt like my least favourite aspects of all his work wrapped together in one package.",

Everything from the camera shots to the background screams Wes and I loved every minute of it. Even though I left the cinema still confused about the ending I wouldn't change a thing. I almost didn't notice Bill Murray at first, hes hidden so well amongst an absolutely stellar cast. If you are a Wes fan this is a must, so much better than Asteroid City.",

Then the typically precious, overelaborate Wes Anderson dialogue, animatronic cardboard characters in place of actual feeling ones and general sense of being caught in the slow turning pages of a hipster control-freak children's story book will gradually diminish your interest in the film.

            "review": "MOONRISE KINGDOM was the first Wes Anderson movie I saw, and it's still my favorite. His newest is THE PHOENICIAN SCHEME, a caper about Zsa-Zsa Korda (Benicio del Toro), a businessman trying to squeeze his investors for more money to help overhaul the infrastructure of Phoenicia with slave labor. Joining him on his swindling journey are his estranged nun-to-be daughter Liesel (Mia Threapleton) and his assistant/tutor Bjørn (Michael Cera). It's a wonder how this is the first Anderson film that has Cera in it, the style is a perfect fit for him. If you're not familiar with the style, it's basically side scrolling camera work, symmetrical compositions, vibrant colors, and quick, whimsical dialogue. His best works have both style and substance. This movie definitely has the style, but I think the substance was lacking for me. Maybe I'm just getting tired of his schtick. The plot felt too mechanical and less emotional. It didn't truly have me invested in any of the characters. I laughed quite a bit though. It's always fun to see who Anderson has in his movies. They probably just come in for a day or two, have some fun filming their scene then leave. As always, this has exquisite art direction and production design. I really enjoyed the main trio. Ultimately, THE PHOENICIAN SCHEME boils down to whether or not you're a fan of Wes Anderson movies. This is one of the quirkier ones in his repertoire. In my opinion, it's visually beautiful and funny, but forgettable.",

            "review": "Wes Anderson's The Phoenician Scheme is a film that looks like art, but feels like air - weightless, aimless, and emotionally barren. It's a museum piece: visually exquisite, technically polished, and utterly disconnected from the audience it should be trying to reach.The film assembles an A-list cast - Benicio del Toro, Tilda Swinton, Jeffrey Wright, and more - and gives them almost nothing to do but perform in fragments. Del Toro, in particular, delivers a sincere, grounded performance that deserves a much better film. He carries sorrow, memory, and depth on his face - all of which are squandered by a script that prefers aesthetic games over human truth.Narratively, the film is a mess. The central character dies repeatedly, appears in surreal \"heavenly\" trials, begs money from estranged people, and pursues a cryptic \"project\" that's never made emotionally or intellectually clear. These events don't connect - not symbolically, not structurally. They're scattered scenes dressed in Anderson's trademark symmetry, but without any pulse behind them. It's not storytelling. It's theater with the plot torn out.For viewers expecting another Grand Budapest Hotel - a film with wit, heart, stakes, and storytelling - this is a staggering disappointment. That movie was from another planet in the best sense; this one is stranded in its own head. The Phoenician Scheme substitutes cohesion with confusion and calls it depth. It's not deep - it's vague. It's not subtle - it's evasive.Worse still, the film weaponizes style as if that alone justifies its existence. It doesn't. The score, the framing, the dialogue - all of it points to a filmmaker more invested in aesthetic gymnastics than in reaching the audience with meaning.Anderson is capable of brilliance. Here, he retreats into self-indulgence. The Phoenician Scheme is a beautiful shell, meticulously painted, and completely hollow.",

But we were the only ones. In all fairness there was only 8 people (including my wife & I). The movie wraps at our theater in four days, so there's that.I can only describe this movie as 30's German art-deco meets The Marx Brothers. Very much an 'artsy' film that requires the audience to interpret and react before the next zing comes at you like a 100mph fastball. At the risk of being tagged a snob, not everyone will get it or like it. I call it 'intelligent slapstick comedy,' as opposed to 'Airplane' or 'Caddyshack' of which both are funny as hell and two of my favourite all-timers. But here there is a difference in comedy styling. I'm a Baby Boomer out of Hollywood-Los Angeles so I'm very familiar with the art-deco architecture seen in Beverly Hills, Palm Springs and older Hollywood hills homes and buildings. The Firestone Tire Building (now Citadel Outlets) on Washington Blvd. Is a perfect example of art-deco styling.One has to be fast on their ears to make out much of the dialogue, as there are plenty of accents to go around and the lines come at you machine gun speed.The star-studded cast is impressive: Benicio Del Toro plays the lead role and gets co-write credits. Mia Threapleton plays a most impressive Sister Liesi. Michael Cerna delivers on one character then switches gears to play another. Scarlett Johansson is la cousine. Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston, Bill Murray, Benedict Cumberbatch, Willem Defoe, F. Murray Abraham, Hope Davis. Apparently everyone wanted in on this project directed by Wes Anderson. It is worth the parade and well worth the price of admission if a 30's art-deco, German slapstick comedy is your shtick.",

This film, which chronicles the decades-spanning career of an ambitious architect, aims for epic grandeur but instead delivers a bloated and convoluted narrative that collapses under its own weight.While the film boasts a striking visual style, meticulously recreating period details and crafting impressive architectural set pieces, this commitment to aesthetic flourishes comes at the expense of a compelling story. We are presented with a series of loosely connected vignettes, each more ponderous than the last, detailing the triumphs and tribulations of a man more cipher than character.The film's central problem is its length. Clocking in far too long, \"Brutalist\" feels like a never-ending tour of a building you've already seen every corner of. The complicated, multi-stranded plot, only adds to the confusion, leaving the audience struggling to piece together a narrative that feels unnecessarily fragmented.Ultimately, \"Brutalist\" is a classic case of style over substance. It's a film that clearly prioritizes visual spectacle over emotional resonance, leaving the viewer feeling impressed but ultimately detached. It's a beautifully constructed edifice with nothing inside, a testament to the fact that even the most impressive facade can't mask a hollow core. This film is less a moving story and more an endurance test, a stark reminder that bigger isn't always better, and that sometimes, less is truly more.

Epic period dramas are not very trendy and asking the audience to sit for three and a half hours, is not an easy demand. With that being said, I went to the cinema curious to see what Brady Corbet made. I have to say that the movie has a nice start and development. Even if the character of László Tóth never existed and this is in fact a pure fictional story, overall it is pretty believable, at least in the first half. We see the protagonist getting to America, slowly integrating in the society and finding his first important job: building a complex for the rich businessman Var Buren.The characterization of the protagonist is incredible: we get to know him inside out, which is his backstory, his strengths, his weaknesses, his vices. A brilliant mind that accomplished so much in his home country, getting awarded for the buildings that he projected. The film does a nice job in contextualizing the historical period, through the tragic events that happened during the 40s and 50s in Europe. Screenwriters managed to create a compelling character that needed to endure many difficulties through his life, as he needed to re-affirm his name in the USA. The director is setting this as a biopic, therefore I was expecting to see all the main important parts of this fictional life. But unfortunately I feel that the movie lost its identity halfway through. I can pinpoint the exact moment where things went sideways: there is a scene set in Italy, where the overall mood completely changed and it seemed to watch a different film altogether. The plot never recovered from this mistake. The story is split into four different parts: the first three parts are following the life of László from the 40s until the 60s, and then there is an incredible time jump that brings us directly to the 80s, showing us all the work that the Hungarian architect did in the US. The problem is that the audience never saw what actually happened in those 20 years. The director focused too much on pointless details and it seemed that he remembered that he needed to actually wrap the film somehow. The ending feels rushed and messy.The movie has good ideas, but it feels very unbalanced towards the end. It is truly a pity, because all the right ingredients are there: incredible cast composed by many great names, wonderful photography, compelling and overall well written story. I am also sure that some of the shots are pretty iconic. Potentially this could have been a modern masterpiece. I strongly believe that considering the nature and the length of the production, this would have worked way better as a limited series of maybe 4-5 episodes. Unfortunately, by the end a lot of things are left unanswered. My final mark is 6.5. I recognized that a lot of effort was made into this project, but potential was wasted.",

Unlike similarly bleak films like Blue Ruin or There Will Be Blood, which draw you in with tension and morbid curiosity, this plot leads nowhere. There's no payoff... just escalating disaster.From the opening scenes, we follow one man's relentless suffering. Any initial empathy quickly evaporates when, mere minutes in, he's berating a prostitute at a brothel. His choices consistently dig him deeper into misery and subservience, accompanied by a \"soundtrack\" that could be described as a cat walking across the far end of a piano. Three hours of discordant notes matching his downward spiral.What's particularly frustrating is the historical context. During an era of American prosperity and opportunity, this accomplished architect with significant works to his name chooses to live small. As an immigrant from a similar background, I find his self-defeating approach baffling. His eloquence, architectural mastery, and charisma suggest he could have carved out a very different path.The film drowns in excess: gratuitous nudity, excessive shaky cam, overwhelming sadness, and random weirdness. If the first half dangles hope and potential, the second half plunges into absolute despair. It's relentlessly dark. A parade of gloom, doom, and ARCHITECTURE. Perhaps this reflects Laszlo Toth's character and work, but I left the theater in a thoroughly bitter mood.That aside, Adrien Brody and Guy Pearce deliver phenomenal performances, but they can't salvage a film that seems designed to make its audience suffer.

It's meant to describe the style of architecture its main protagonist employs - harsh, massive, cold concrete monstrosities of buildings. But it also speaks to the brutality of class-divided America, and perhaps of humankind itself.Some think it's an epic drama of immigration to America by WWII refugees, and part one attests to that and promises much. The we have part 2 where the main character, Hungarian immigrant Laszlo Toth, finds a mentor in the rich but empty-hearted and ultimately cruel businessman Harrison Van Buren and his caricature family. A major architectural project for the local town alternatively promises much then falls apart, much like Toth's relationship with .. just about everyone. The movie falls apart here as it leaps blindingly from confused and often totally unnecessary scene to scene, wasting another couple of hours.Then we have the epilogue, 20 years later, which is bizarre. It explains little and leaves a lot of unanswered questions. When the final credits roll (at a jarring 30 degree angle), the numbness and frank shock in the cinema audience was palpable.Adrien Brody gives a fabulous performance in the lead role, although you are never quite sure whether you are supposed to be on his side or not. Felicity Jones seems miscast to me as his refugee wife, physically weak but mentally strong, to me she just doesn't look right for the role. Then there is Guy Pearce, one of my favourite actors, who is very good in the Van Buren role but not Oscar material as has been touted - his performance is just slightly too affected for that.I'll give it 6 stars for the grandeur of vision, even if unrealised, as well as Brody's performance and the great musical score. But it will go down in my memory as yet another if these grand artistic Hollywood visions that don't really work, and descend into confusion and outright stupidity at times. Many will praise it and score it highly, like those who view a pretentious painting as a visionary masterpiece.

At the beginning of the film, I expected it to be a concentration camp survivor's story. And it is that, but it's also more complicated than that. The protagonist (played by Adrian Brody) is gradually revealed to have more layers to his personality than we thought. At first we see him as a refugee at the end of World War II doing grunt work in a relative's small furniture factory to survive, but then we realize that he has a brilliant and creative mind that functions on a much higher level than his worldly position would indicate. He's dependent on other people to survive. At first they appear to be kind benefactors, but then turn out to be really slimy individuals. If anything goes wrong, he's invariably blamed for it, and sent packing. He's given a bad time by virtually everyone. He realizes that, being an outsider, an undesirable foreigner, that he's at an extreme disadvantage. The kindness of strangers turns out to be not-so-kind, after all. But when his former prewar stardom in the field of architecture becomes known, suddenly those who despised him and treated him like garbage, start sucking up to him because they want the prestige of being associated with him. Then there is his sexual impotence, a nascent heroin addiction, and a wife trapped in Europe by the endless bureaucracy of the repatriation process. I don't feel that I could adequately give more details without spoilers.This turns out to be like QUEER, in that it is highly episodic, and that the episodes do not neatly dovetail together. It's also like QUEER in that, rather puzzlingly, so many of the male characters can't seem to keep their hands off the Brody character, although he never reacts to it. This is a tough movie because there are a lot of good things about it, despite having a plot that simply doesn't hang together. Its biggest assets are the evocative art direction, photography, costumes, and the performances of Brody and the actress who plays his wife. (It's also true that they are given the best material; the other characters are right out of 19th Century melodrama-a sweet orphaned ingenue, a \"friend\" who leads good people into bad habits, and villains who do every dastardly deed but wear capes and twirl their mustaches.) On the whole, the movie seemed \"undeveloped\" to me. There's a lot of potential here that was simply unrealized.",

            "review": "I had no intention of watching The Brutalist, but I ended up going to the cinema unexpectedly. With a runtime of almost four hours, I was convinced I would feel the weight of time and eventually get bored. However, I couldn't have been more wrong-I was absorbed from the very first minutes and drawn into a rare and powerful cinematic experience.The Brutalist is a dense, demanding, and meticulous film. It's one of those works that require a certain state of mind, and honestly, I know it's not for everyone. I completely understand those who might find it boring or excessive, but for me, it was the opposite. From the start, I was captivated by the masterful editing, which maintains an almost hypnotic rhythm without ever becoming monotonous, the outstanding performances that bring incredibly complex characters to life, and the breathtaking cinematography that turns each frame into a true work of art. The soundtrack, grand and carefully integrated, adds an epic layer to many scenes, contributing to the film's immersive atmosphere.To illustrate how I felt watching this masterpiece, I recently had a completely different experience with Nosferatu (2024). Although they are very different films, Nosferatu is half as long, has more action, and yet I found it absurdly boring and soulless (like 75% of Eggers' films). On the other hand, The Brutalist, with its slower development, managed to keep me engaged in every scene, allowing me to form a genuine emotional connection with the story. In my view, cinema should involve me and evoke emotions, and The Brutalist achieved exactly that.The story itself is relatively straightforward, but its depth lies in the themes it explores. Following the journey of a Jewish architect who emigrates to the United States in search of a new life, the film delves into topics such as immigration, identity, ambition, greed, and the desire to leave a lasting legacy. More than just the story, it's the characters that make The Brutalist so impactful. Each one carries an emotional complexity that unfolds layer by layer, and the performances are simply astounding. It's impossible not to feel immersed in the protagonist's journey, brilliantly portrayed by Adrien Brody.It's not hard to understand, but it's an extremely dense work with much to reflect on regarding themes such as immigration, greed, ambition, legacy, and architecture. However, it's the depth of the characters and the remarkable performances that define each moment.Despite all its strengths, the film is not perfect. For me, the biggest issue is the ending (well before the epilogue), which felt rushed and somewhat inconclusive for certain characters who played such a significant role throughout this odyssey. It's as if the film was building up to something grand but didn't quite know how to wrap it up in the most satisfying way. The epilogue tries to fill some of these gaps, but it still feels like a somewhat abrupt conclusion for a film that demands so much from the audience over nearly four hours.Overall, The Brutalist is a film that requires patience and commitment but rewards those who allow themselves to be immersed in it. It's not an easy film, but it's a powerful and emotionally rich cinematic experience that encourages reflection on timeless themes in a visually stunning way. Without a doubt, it's a film that will stay with me for a long time. And this, my friends, is cinema in its purest form.",

He has all the elements of a great story of a great film and yet to me it does not deliver.For three and half hours long there's only one question in my mind I couldn't shake : what is it about. And I could never answer that question not even at the end if ever there was one. The whole thing left me septic.But in all honesty, there isn't much to say about it all. To me it's like I've been handed over a homework. If watching « this kind of movie », I want to feel an experience, be engulfed in the ambiance of a whole, I want to be caught in the prospect of what the delivery will be, I want to feel like I've been outsmarted in some ways. None of it here.Brody is magnificent, so is Pearce. Jones too, surely. Cinematography is mastered without a doubt, editing is smooth, and for three and a half hours it is enjoyable if you're able to glean the little sparks that here and there will keep you hungry for more.If it was trying to lead me into an underlying experience, meaning or point of view, well I didn't find the path, or maybe was it just too obscure to even grasp a fragment of what the purpose of it all was.Yes, it works whatever it is about or whatever it thinks it is about. I doubt it will be a movie that's remembered. It not particularly bold. It makes an attempt at being powerful but it never strikes. It too clean, it's too plain. It makes you believe straight from the opening shot that it will be grandiose. But it doesn't hold it promise.I feel a bit duped by what I've watched. Just because you write a movie about an « unusual » subject, just because you try an unorthodox approach at something that's already been said before, well it seems sufficient to make praise.That is not enough for me. This didn't prove me anything. I think it is possible and achievable and somewhat too easy to make beautiful movies that will pass for profound when it is just a very well made movie without substance.",

            "review": "The Brutalist is full of surprises. The characters are not who you expect - not in the Scooby Doo ending kinda way, but in the more subtle, incremental ways that real people reveal themselves - they unfurl over time, in new context, or when forced by circumstance.Here the circumstance is post-WWII-horror. Adrien Brody's Laszlo, a jewish architect who escaped the clutches of bloody Europe, ekes into the welcoming arms of America - or is confronted by them - in a frenetic opening sequence that evokes being literally birthed by the Statue of Liberty. His becomes a journey of perpetually navigating life's variety of horrors: existential, professional, familial, intimate - never taking his eyes off the prize of grand achievement, and never assessing the value of that prize to begin with. What's the lesson?Is it the shameful discovery that his success wasn't born in spite of his trauma, but because of it? Do we owe a debt to abuse? To the forces of culture, country, power and those who wield it, in the building of our brutal legacies (and homelands)? Are our lives gasoline that gets burned up en route to some place more meaningful?The movie is charming, cool looking, and not boring (did you hear it was long?). It feels like it's based on an old novel - a mysterious tome that I would love to mine for some of the details the movie refuses to share. But there is no novel. This aging Man's search for meaning becomes ours as well. And any greater understanding of Laszlo's arrival, his families' machinations, his country and rootlessness, or the evolution of his very feelings on the subjects, for better or worse, feels up to us to construct.",

The movie has an epic sweep to it but also, I would say, some unnecessary scenes here and there. I didn't think all the sex scenes were necessary, or at least I thought they were too drawn out, and various other interstitial shots that felt excessive. I didn't like Pearce's performance so much. Although he's playing an unlikable character, true, there's just an artificiality about his delivery and mannerisms that I didn't like here.The epilogue of the movie ends a little flat and on an odd note. It's just one of those \"weird\" endings, imo, but that's pretty typical for an a24 movie. I cared about Brody's character, but where did he REALLY go, in the end? Ask yourself that. He gets lost a bit, for me, with all the other side narratives and architectural explorations going on, and then it just kind of ends.Thematically, the movie reflects the tension between artistry and capitalism well.

Hey, if you're giving us a 3 1/2 hour movie, I really appreciate the break.Corbet gave us so much more than a retro-novelty to stretch our legs and use the bathroom, though. The Brutalist is what I want more of in movies: gorgeous cinema, challenging material, conflicts with perspective, and a story that asks us \"why\" again right after getting an answer to the previous question.It helps that the lead character, a Hungarian architect escaping Germany in the mid-20th century for being Jewish, is played by Adrian Brody, the son of a Hungarian immigrant himself (and who grew up speaking the language). Brody is no stranger to stand-out performances, and this marathon outing is no exception.We see so much more than just one man's journey or struggle, and I credit the director for delivering us art instead of relying on the safety net of a well-written story. Corbet has a talent for this, a freshness that I hope will continue to push the industry forward.",

            "review": "I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like \"The Phantom Menace,\" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was \"How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?\" rather than \"How entertaining is this film overall?\" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.Critics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children's movies, like \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Mary Poppins,\" are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, \"Adventures in Babysitting\"), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like \"Home Alone\" and \"Mrs. Doubtfire.\" Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.But much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--\"Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers\"--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.Not that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.The problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary \"muggle\" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.Although the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I've never seen happen before, though I don't go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.The answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he's kicked out, he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn't enough tying them all together.What we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form, it's almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling's series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing.",

            "review": "We live in a world where economics is hard. This forces practical limitations when making a movie. Time and money are sadly finite, cinema owners need to be pleased as well as fans and computer animation ain't perfect. Given these limitations, this film is about as close to human perfection as it is possible to achieve. However, it's extremely clear what an immense challenge it is to turn Philosopher's Stone from book to film.Two and a half hours is not long to explore a wonderful, magical world. Furthermore, the directors have bowed to the inevitable temptation to show us things that cannot be communicated so effectively in a book. The consequence is the feeling of a slightly breathless sprint in places.It also means that the movie has to stay true to the spirit of the book rather than to the letter of it. There are omissions and there are changes. The changes that were made capture and maintain the spirit of the story really well; indeed, there are places where the story is more clearly and straightforwardly told in the movie than in the book. Some aspects of the story are fleshed out on screen and the additions are delightful, completely in keeping with the flavour of the world.The humour of the movie is inevitably more visual than that of the book; no belly laughs, but a lot of smiles. Some punchlines have changed, but the reasons why the jokes are funny remain the same. Not knowing exactly what's coming next is a good thing! It's all kept tasteful, classy and above the belt; there's nothing to cringe about.The voice acting is almost uniformly brilliant. However, there are occasions where some of the actors are required to convey high emotions and are only given a second or two of face shot, or head-and-shoulders shot, to do so. This isn't as much freedom as they need and they fall a little short. The blame here must fall on the decision to give the actors too much to do too quickly, not on the actors themselves.Other than these rare jarring instances, the physical acting is frequently excellent and seldom less than completely adequate, judged against the highest of targets set by the book's clear emotion descriptions.Dan Radcliffe has the look, the mannerisms and the charm of Harry down pat. His strongest expressions are the bemusement that must be inherent at entering a world where science does not rule alone and the bravery that Harry shows in his achievements. Emma Watson possibly slightly overplays Hermione, but does so in a fully endearing fashion. There's one scene which gives her too little chance to truly express panic; otherwise her performance needs no changes.Rupert Grint has comic timing way beyond his years, hitting Ron's lines perfectly. Tom Felton makes a stylish Draco; Matt Lewis' Neville character suffers from the acceleration, so the finale does come as a slight characterisation shock.The Phelps brothers' Fred and George are distinctively cheeky rather than proactive pranksters; Chris Rankin imbues Percy with genuine authority. Sean Biggerstaff shines; his Oliver Wood is likeable and an ideal Quidditch team captain.Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid is the single dominant adult character, with maximum laughs extracted at every step. The movie changes strongly exaggerate one side of Hagrid's nature, though; probably inevitable considering how much plot exposition his character has.David Bradley has a vicious Argus Filch; John Hurt's Ollivander is an eccentric treat, giving a wonderful introduction to the Wizarding World. The professors are uniformly excellent, though Richard Harris' Dumbledore comes off as disappointingly flat until the end.The most ambitious point of the movie is the computer generated imagery. The stills are wonderful, but the fastest animation is restricted by the limitations of real-world technology. The book makes extremely stringent demands of the CGI; sometimes their overall effect in the movie is merely good rather than insanely great. Some of the magic spells and effects look awesome; others don't capture the imagination nearly so much.The world cannot yet completely convincingly animate human beings doing inhuman things, which serves as a clear reminder that you need fictional magic to make the impossible possible. The Quidditch scene is the most demanding of them all; while the sequence is action-packed and good-looking, disappointingly, it's not a total success. Perhaps some of the scenes would have been better with more conventional special effects? (For instance, the lower-tech-looking Sorting Hat scene is one of the most delightful of them all.)The set looks gorgeous. However, it may not stand up to detailed analysis. It's fairly obvious that things are shot in many disparate locations, rather than one big Hogwarts School near Hogsmeade.The score is absolutely wonderful. The soundtrack may rely too heavily on The Famous Bit, but it's clear that the balance and mixture of things in the finished movie are exactly right.The feel of the whole movie is everything fans could have hoped for. The dialogue is intensely measured, the colouring is suitably epic, the selection of what to leave in is really tightly considered. You get chills in your spine at the right places; you feel the triumphs as all-encompassing endorphin highs. It's clear that the production have thought long, hard and lovingly. They are true fans of the story, they are the right people for the job, it all bodes very well for the second film.So it could never have been the film that the hyper-literalists were hoping for, then, but it is as good as the practicalities of the real world could possibly permit. Don't expect miracles and you'll love it. I look forward to watching it again and again.8/10 at the very least. A really satisfactory film!",

The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.I'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that they'll tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams's perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There's something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the \"magical\" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of them.Welcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you're a ten-year-old kid who doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you'll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren't perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they're looking at things that were added in post production!Usually, in kids' movies, there's a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they're watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you'll see a host of familiar faces as \"guest stars\" but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they're so convincing as the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable Snape, and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can't imagine they've had any other career prior to these movies! Is there any kid who doesn't immediately attribute the word \"earwax\" to Richard Harris, point out striped cats as \"Maggie Smith cats\", mumble \"Shouldn't have said that,\" when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?First movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling's fantasy world, there's so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.Each installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of the exposition. If a three-headed dog doesn't immediately conjure the name \"Fluffy,\" chess pieces have never come to life in your imagination, you don't laugh at the idea of counting your birthday presents, and you don't know what Richard Harris wants most in the world, you're missing out on one of the great joys in life. If somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie theaters Thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie.",

            "review": "To millions of children of all ages, November 16 has been more eagerly anticipated than Christmas, as the long-awaited film version of J. K. Rowling's beloved novel \"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone\" hits the screen.Each of Rowling's four Harry Potter books have been critically acclaimed worldwide best-sellers, turning a generation of video-game playing children into avid readers.In translating Rowling's world of wizards and magic to the screen, the film makers claimed to be intensely aware of the fans' high expectations and had sworn to be faithful to the book.\"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone\" is indeed the most loyal film adaptation of a book that this fan has ever seen.It's the story of an orphaned boy who discovers on his eleventh birthday that his parents were wizards and that he is in fact a famous and powerful wizard himself.Released from the clutches of his desperately ordinary (and non-magical) Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia - and their deliciously obnoxious son Dudley - Harry takes his place in the wizarding world as a first year student at the venerated Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.A great deal of \"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone\" is an introduction to this fantastic and dangerous world and its richly drawn characters. There's not only a lot of plot to cover in this film, but an entire world to create.At two and a half hours long (hit the restroom before it starts), the film includes the book's most memorable scenes, bringing many of them to life with pure cinematic wizardry.The Quidditch match (a soccer/hockey/rugby thing played on broomsticks) is much more exciting on the screen than on the page, as is the bathroom battle with an enormous mountain troll and the larger-than-life game of wizard's chess.The frightening aspects of the book are in full force in the film, and its PG rating (for some scary moments) should be taken seriously.Screenwriter Steven Kloves (\"Wonder Boys\") has done a fine job of streamlining Rowling's tale while maintaining its spirit. Director Chris Columbus (\"Home Alone\") makes good on his promise to be faithful to the book. But at times the film is a bit too reverent; you want the actors to cut loose and have a bit more fun.Columbus clearly understands that fantasy works best when it's played most real. Across the board, his fine ensemble of actors are so perfectly cast that they appear to have literally stepped out of Rowling's book.In the title role, Daniel Radcliffe pulls off the very difficult task of playing an introverted hero who spends most of the movie reacting to the amazing sights and events around him. He beautifully captures the deep soul and untapped potential of Harry Potter. And when this kid smiles the screen lights up.Rupert Grint is delightful as Harry's sardonic buddy Ron Weasley and Emma Watson nearly steals the film as their overachieving friend Hermione Granger. Three cheers to the film makers for giving three unknown child actors the top billing they deserve.The strong cast of veteran actors includes Richard Harris as the wise Headmaster Dumbledore and Robbie Coltrane as the lovable giant Hagrid. Alan Rickman is wonderfully villainous as Professor Snape and Zoe Wanamaker has just the right touch of girls gym teacher as flying instructor Madame Hooch.As the strict but just Professor McGonagall, Oscar winner Maggie Smith seems born to play the role - and is ready for another Oscar.John Cleese (as Nearly Headless Nick) and Julie Walters (as Mrs. Weasley) have all-too-brief cameo roles, but if the next film \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" remains true to the book, we'll be seeing more of them.In addition to being highly engaging, the film is a marvelous thing to look at. From the bustling wizard street Diagon Alley to the magnificently gothic Hogwarts School to the dark and misty Forbidden Forest, the film breaks new ground in imaginative production design.To paraphrase the film's tagline, let the magic (and box office records) begin.",

            "review": "Once upon a time (and not that long ago), in the vivid, fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling, a character was born:  A boy.  A young boy named Harry, who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long, long time, and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world.  And now, thanks to the magic of the cinema, Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture, `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves.  Indeed, Harry Potter is a boy, but not just any boy; because Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just happens to be a wizard.  But, orphaned as a baby, Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), who never let him in on the fact that he was, well-- what he was.  It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister-- Harry's mother-- because she was a witch; nor of Harry's father because he, too, was a wizard.  When Harry turns eleven, however, the secret is out of the bag when-- after some strange goings-on-- a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to `Hogwarts,' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born:  The gift of magic!  And from the moment Harry boards the train (from station platform nine-and-three-quarters) that will take him to his destiny, the magic is alive-- for Harry, and for the audience, as well; and it's a journey you will never forget.What a monumental undertaking to even think of attempting-- translating and transferring this passionately beloved work from novel to the screen. Because to millions of people, Harry and his companions are so much more than merely characters in a book; these are characters for whom people have made a special place in their hearts, which puts a great burden of trust upon the man who would attempt to bring them to life.  And Chris Columbus, it turns out, was the right man for the job.  More than rising to the occasion and with some magic of his own-- and a lot of help from an extraordinarily talented cast and crew-- Columbus has delivered a film that is not only true to the story, but true to the very spirit that makes Harry Potter so special.  The special effects are absolutely beyond astounding, and Columbus, with a keen eye for detail and without missing a beat, keeps it all on track and moving right along at a pace and with a sense of timing that makes this an absorbing, thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable experience from beginning to end.  From the opening frame you get the feeling that you're about to have a singular experience; and you're right. Because you've just entered the world of Harry Potter.  And it's magic.Even having the best special effects do not a great movie make, however, and this film is no exception; what catapults this one to the top are the performances, beginning with Radcliffe, whom you quickly forget is an actor playing a part.  And that about sums up what kind of a job this young man does here.  Without question, he IS Harry Potter, physically and emotionally, and when he waves his wand and does what he does, you believe it.  A wonderful performance by a gifted actor who has a great career ahead of him; without question the perfect choice for the role of Harry.Also turning in excellent performances are Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione.  As with Radcliffe, the casting here could not have been more perfect.  Grint is `Everyboy,' with that special glint in his eye and a manner that makes him especially endearing.  And the spunky Watson adds some real sparkle to the film as Hermione, the one with the sense of urgency and the wherewithal to get things done; a real role model for young girls everywhere.It's obvious that a lot of care went into the casting of this film, and it's a big part of why it is so successful.  Richard Harris, as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore; Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall; John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander; Ian Hart as Professor Quirrell.  Exceptional performances from one and all, with two that stand out as especially memorable:  Robbie Coltrane, who readily conveys the fact that Hagrid's heart is of a size that matches that of the man; and Alan Rickman, as Professor Severus Snape, deliciously droll while demonstrating menace through the fine art of articulation.The additional supporting cast includes John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick), Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick), Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley), Zoe Wanamaker (Madame Hooch), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Harry Melling (Dudley) and David Bradley (Filch).  From Rowling's imagination to the written page to real life (albeit via the movie screen), `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a triumph many times over; a unique film of truly universal appeal, the likes of which is as rare as, well-- a sorcerer's stone.  A film in which adults and children alike will rejoice, because it speaks to the heart in a universal language of life, love, experience and imagination; a film that states unequivocally that magic exists-- as long as there's a single child with a single dream somewhere in the world, and real wizards like J.K. Rowling, Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves and every member of this wonderful cast and crew around to bring it to life as they have here.  An instant classic in every sense of the word, this is truly a film for the ages.  A remarkable achievement, this IS the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",

            "review": "I watched this movie first time when I was left with no choice. My expectations were extremely low as I always wondered if Harry Potter books were over-hyped. How-ever after watching the movie it did make me a Harry Potter movie fan. And needless to say - this continues to remain my favourite of HP series. That brings to a point here.... the effect of expectations over a movie. True, expectations reduce joy.Without going into the story I would certainly say Chris Columbus churns out a perfect pot-pourri of emotions, suspense and magic, delivering something appealing to all ages.Every character brought to life on screen has done justice and leave an impression on you. Particularly notable performances by Emma Watson and Alan Rickman.CGI are in plenty and made good of. The Quedditch game is picturised amazingly. The wizard's chess is treat to eyes.Let's hope that the forthcoming HP series carries the similar magical touch.",

            "review": "I feel, next to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best book-to-movie adaptation that I've ever seen. The sets were stunning - the actors were first rate - the effects were breathtaking.  The film flowed quite smoothly in it's transition from page to screen, never tripping on the awkward conventions that other books on film have struggled with.   The screenplay, by Steven Kloves, stripped away all unnecessary elements to get to the root of the story.  Though many events from the book were excluded, the essential ones made it to the film. And it makes for one smooth story and very enjoyable movie-going experience.Many kudos to Chris Columbus and the rest of the Harry Potter cast/crew for not turning this movie into what it easily could have become:  a 2 and a half hour commercial advertisement for action figures and collectibles, kid's meals and fast food tie-ins, soft drinks and snack products, etc. and instead focused on bringing J.K. Rowling's story to life as accurately and as lovingly as it deserves.  There has been much speculation on whether Columbus was the correct choice for the first two installments of the series and I say to that, Yes.  I feel that he accomplished what most would have failed.  He has proven, at least to me, that Diagon Alley truly exists - if only I could find the right brick to tap on.  The world of Harry Potter is no longer fantasy to me, but instead a place where any of us mere Muggles could hope to visit, one day.One of my favorite moments, is what I'm going to refer to as the Adrenaline Sequence.  By Adrenaline Sequence, I mean the sequence in a movie that for all intents and purposes, doesn't necessarily propel the story, but gives the audience a huge theatrical payoff, ala the Pod Race sequence in The Phantom Menace.  The Adrenaline Sequence for this particular movie is the Quidditch sequence.  I was very happy to finally see the 'hockey/soccer hybrid on a broomstick' come to life.  The Quidditch Sequence is, by far, my favorite sequence in the whole film.  The scene is dizzying in it's violence and it's one breathless moment after another.  My hat goes off to Columbus and his team for succeeding in making this scene as memorable as it should be.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantastic movie for children of all ages.  Fans and non-fans alike will enjoy this colorful story of good versus evil and the friendships that endure.",

I've never read the books and this film did nothing to make me want to read them. The only spell this cast over me was one to get me out of the room as quickly as possible every time I have seen this on after my first viewing of it in the cinema.

I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family friend to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act's Maggie Smith, James Bond 007's Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars' Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films. The catalyst of the movie series!",

The cast was brilliant (particularly notable are Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, and the eerily creepy David Bradley as Argus Filch), the directing wonderful, and the scenery perfect.

That is:  the story of a young boy who has suddenly had his wildest dream come true, and who now must deal with his newfound celebrity, his amazing magical heritage, and most of all, day to day life at Hogwarts with his friends (and enemies).  The movie is more preoccupied with populating Hogwarts with ghosts and moving staircases than it is with characters of any depth.  Everyone from the book, Harry included, suffers from a serious lack of on-screen development, and as a consequence the story lurches  ponderously from event to event without the throughline that stong character development would bring.  I, for one, am not easily impressed by effects, no matter how impressive, especially when they are a duplicitous substitute for the real strength of a story such as this:  character.",

            "review": "So, £85 million well spent? I guess since they've already made more than double that back, then from a financial point of view - Yes! But as a film....Frankly I would rather remove one of my own limbs with a blunt hacksaw, then eat it raw before I watched this again. 2.5 hours of some of the most boring drivel, bad acting, weak special effects and irritating children you could hope to come across. The sooner these \"Child Stars\" descend into a drug and sodomy filled adolescence the better for all concerned.Yes I have read the books, and yes, I enjoyed them, but this is still one of the dullest films I've ever encountered. Sticking to the original story is one thing, but when the audience are left praying for the last 5 chapters to be cut, something's gone wrong.Back to my original point - where did the £85 million go? The Quidditch match was about on a par with King Kong for realism, and using Fungus the Bogeyman for the Troll was a masterpiece of imagination-free modelling. Perhaps all the money went on getting the magic tricks to look right? Or maybe not. How much effort does it take to have some brat wave his wand, the camera cuts away, comedy explosion sound effect, then camera cuts back to child with spiky hair and blackened face? Pure genius! They really have pushed back the boundaries of comedy here.All in all I feel cheated out of 2.5 hours of my life, and I strongly recommend that you don't fall into the same trap. If you have 2.5 hours that you really want rid of, then I'd suggest spending it slowly rubbing sandpaper over your eyeballs - it's cheaper, and more pleasant on the senses.",

            "review": "HARRY POTTER / (2001) *** (out of four)Here's a method of evaluating a movie based on previously published material: ask yourself if the film makes you want to read the material from which it is based?Before the release of \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" I was one of the few remaining souls who had not read J.K. Rowling's fantasy book series. After screening the first film installment, I did want to read the book. Borrowing the novel from a family member, I briefly skimmed over the chapters. The book's intelligence and similarities with the film really surprised me.With over 100 million copies sold in over 46 different languages, J.K. Rowling's best-selling series of books has become a worldwide phenomenon. Naturally, with soaring expectations abound, the filmmakers felt great pressure to create a faithful adaptation. They have. This film is essentially a visualization of the words in the novel, with very few differences.That said, the film does run into a few conflicts with the book's story. The middle of the movie has nowhere to go. It's like a false second act; almost nothing of major significance occurs in this period of the film. The young characters wander from scene to scene with nothing much to do and nothing much to say. We're left with a grand display of eye-popping special effects.\"Harry Potter\" certainly dazzles us with a solid beginning and an engaging final act, however. We first meet a young wizard boy named Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). Soon after the film opens, the boy discovers he has magical powers. He's then thrust into an enchanting world of sorcery, magic, and witchcraft. He's sent to a school for young wizard children, where he meets new friends, learns about magic, and participates in fun competitions. But someone at the school doesn't like Harry, as mysterious events begin to occur. Harry soon finds himself in the middle of a diabolical scheme of revenge. Who is the culprit and what do they want with Harry?The film asks some involving questions. Too bad it doesn't give enough depth to the side characters or subplots. We don't really care about the mystery because we don't know enough about the suspects. The movie does conclude with a twist, but it doesn't encourage another examination of the movie. It lacks a foundation altogether. The story spends so much time foreshadowing the villain's identity, it is pointless for the story to abandon its proceeding plot points and develop a new villain at the end. The book gets away with this; the movie does not.After his gentle \"Home Alone\" and sweet-natured \"Stepmom,\" many questioned the ability of director Chris Columbus to bring a sense of darkness to the story-and for good reason. \"Harry Potter\" contains charming, likable characters and a rich pallet of lush, inventive images. Unfortunately, the film lacks an edge. It's missing the dark atmosphere Rowling's novel so vividly brought to life. Columbus does construct some memorable sequences, but the individual scenes themselves are much better than the movie as a whole.Despite it's childish story and pre-teen characters, many define \"Harry Potter\" as a film for all ages. While that's debatable, during my screening, adults were plowing through the isles every five minutes. Going to the bathroom? Getting drink refills? Buying concessions? Who knows? But not a single child budged from their seat. Their eyes were glued to the big screen.Conclusion: It's a sure-fire experience for children, especially if they've read the books. But adults may not encounter the same enticement as kids. Then again, if I had nothing better to do than to count the people leaving the theater, why am I recommending the film?",

If you're a fantasy fan like I am, and believe in magic (in a fictional sense) then you may very well detest this movie, as I did.  Magic comes easily to little Harry Potter, who has no personality to speak of except that he is occasionally sad that he never met his mum and dad.  Years of abuse and neglect have left not a mark on him, so when he gets invited to Hogwarts Academy of Magic, he has nowhere for his character to go.  There he flies around on his broomstick and gets to be a big hero quite by accident without ever confronting any serious obstacles or anything resembling a plot.

It's not that it was godawful, but having read the book, I knew how it all worked out-- and I had no confidence left that there would be anything the least bit interesting about how Rowling's story would be illustrated.That's what it is; the book faithfully, and dully, illustrated, line by line.  It's so faithful to the order of incidents (and the need to keep the story moving) that it has no time to give us any of the characterization that made us root for Harry; at best we get instantly recognizable movie stereotypes (Draco Malfoy has a Richie Rich 'do, therefore he must be from the same snotty rich kids' fraternity as Greg Marmalard).  Seemingly ideal casting-- Alan Rickman as Snape, say-- is wasted when the characters turn out only to have half a dozen lines in the entire movie, most of them expository.  Maggie Smith, Ian Hart, Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, all wasted; the peerless John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick has, as memory serves, all of two lines-- one to explain why he's nearly headless, and one to announce, in Boys' Own Weekly cliches, that the Quidditch Cup is sure going to be hotly contested this year.  Maybe only Robbie Coltrane and John Hurt get enough dialogue to begin to sketch a character.The other problem-- not unrelated, surely-- is that Chris Columbus is, for the millionth time, the wrong wrong wrong director for the job.  He has no sense of magic, of mystery, of English eccentricity.  Give him two wizards skulking about a suburban tract house, and he'll make them seem as ordinary as two retirees strolling and chatting about the weather.  Give him an evil spirit sucking the blood of a dead unicorn and being interrupted by a centaur, and he makes it seem like two retirees strolling and chatting about the weather.  Give him a chess game, and he makes it seem like World War III.  Give him Gringott's bank, and he ignores the baroque set that's been built and can't wait to show us a big pile of gold, which is surely a bit revealing.  This isn't as awful a blockbuster as, say, Tomb Raider, but it comes from the same land of impoverished imagination camouflaged with booming, expensive yet somehow cheap-looking special effects.",

But still, since it was a movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I had to check it out.Writers Kevin Burrows and Matt Mider put together an enjoyable script and storyline. Sure, it was running on many generic tropes for a heist movie, but it still proved rather enjoyable.The scene with the music in the van was a nice homage to some of Eddie Murphy's earlier classic movies.The movie does have some familiar faces on the cast list, with the likes of Eddie Murphy, Eva Longoria, Pete Davidson, Ismael Cruz Cordova and Andrew Dice Clay. The acting performances in \"The Pickup\" were good.There is a good amount of action throughout the course of the movie, which definitely helps to spruce up the narrative. It was nicely executed action sequences as well.I was actually genuinely entertained throughout the course of the movie. It was like a trip back to the action comedies of the 1990s. This is a popcorn movie, so just lean back in the seat, munch on the snacks and enjoy the ride.My rating of director Tim Story's 2025 movie \"The Pickup\" lands on a six out of ten stars.",

Eddie Murphy, Pete Davidson, Keke Palmer and Eva Longoria are pretty good. The heist is done pretty well with Tim Story's direction. The action and comedy are also done pretty well. And finally, the movie is straightforward with the execution and I like that it wasn't trying to be too smart or stupid.Negatives for The Pickup (2025):\nThe plot of this movie very predictable and you know what is going to happening with every plot point. You have Eddie Murphy and Pete Davidson teaming up with Keke Palmer and they are doing the typical \"We don't like each other, but we will work together for the mission and we surely won't be connecting with one another and be good buddies after our mission.\" and it plays out exactly how you imagine it being. The villains are very one-note and I don't even remember their names. And finally, this plot has been done before and done better in other movies.Overall, The Pickup (2025) is your typical streaming movie that you can watch at home and get some superficial entertainment from watching it and that's about it.",

He thinks that is a hold up note, so he pulls his gun. She only wanted to date him and he hooks up with her. Russell (Eddie Murphy) wants that days run to be easy, to get to his 25th Wedding Anniversary dinner that night. And Russell is planing to leave his job, and they will start a B&B. But his boss has other ideas, and puts him on a terrible run, and worse, pairs him with Travis. Travis comes from a family of cops, but couldn't make the cut, so he is a guard. He is rather a goofball. Just when one gets tired of his stupid decisions, he makes a good one. While on their run, they get hijacked, and they figure they are going to be robbed, and then killed. Turns out the only thing Travis is good at is driving, so there are some interesting chase scenes, and those wanting the truck are very determined, and it was well planned out. A problem with this movie is that it is very uneven. Fun and interesting intermixed with dumb and stupid. Russell seems to be along for the ride. Travis seems either to act totally dense or simply out of his league. We do meet up with Zoe again, and that adds an interesting twist. A very lightweight movie that has its charms.

That's why 'Warfare', the latest and arguably best A24 film I've seen in a long while, floored me. This isn't some patriotic puff piece. It's raw, visceral, and deeply uncomfortable in all the right ways.Co-directed by Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza (a former Navy SEAL whose real-life experience forms the backbone of the story), 'Warfare' drops you headfirst into the chaos of a mission gone sideways in 2006 Ramadi (Iraq). There's no time for character backstories or emotional flashbacks. You're in the dirt with these men, hearing the crack of gunfire, the ragged breathing, the frantic comms - every heartbeat of the film is felt in your chest. Real war, as this film so powerfully reminds us, isn't medals and glory. It's blood, guts, and a harrowing sense of hopelessness.The cast - most notably D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Cosmo Jarvis, and Will Poulter - bring a haunting realism to their roles. You don't watch them; you endure alongside them. And that's what elevates 'Warfare' into something more than cinema. It's an experience. A brutal, brilliantly made, and emotionally devastating experience.Any loss of life in war is a failure - of diplomacy, of leadership, of humanity. This film doesn't flinch from that truth. It holds your gaze and says: look at what we do to each other.A masterpiece. Uncompromising and unforgettable. If you can, see it in a theatre. The sound design alone is worth the ticket - each echoing explosion and muffled breath immerses you deeper into the dread-soaked trenches of reality. 'Warfare' doesn't just show war. It makes you feel every awful second of it.",

            "review": "Warfare isn't a war film. It's war.Garland and Mendoza strip the genre of everything recognizable: no character arcs, no flashbacks, no patriotic overtures or emotional beats. There are no names to remember. No home to long for. No cinematic scaffolding to hold onto. What's left is the brutal machinery of combat - dry, immediate, procedural.This is not the psychological descent of Apocalypse Now, nor the trembling humanism of Saving Private Ryan. It's more like being waterboarded with dust, sound, and confusion.The camera is unflinching - tight, reactive, often handheld but never \"shaky-cam\" chaos. It moves with the soldiers, but never sentimentalizes them. There's no slow-mo. No meditative framing. Just bodies moving through smoke, clearing rooms, capturing buildings. The lens doesn't find beauty in destruction - it avoids it entirely. The few wide shots we get are just to show how small they are. How futile it all looks from a distance. The sound design is relentless: radios crackling over one another, gunfire echoing through narrow alleyways. There is almost no score, and when music does appear (Low's Dancing and Blood) it's droning, ghostly, anti-heroic. It haunts rather than elevates. The production design is chillingly effective. Everything feels lived-in and long-dead at the same time. You can smell the ash, feel the heat radiating off the concrete. The environments aren't stylized, they're decayed, abandoned, half-real. It feels like the war has already happened, and this is just the residue.One of the final moments, set to the droning nightmare of Low's Dancing and Blood, shows a blurry portrait of an Iraqi family seconds before their home is destroyed. Not for shock. Not for plot. But because that is war-it happens, and then it's gone, and the image remains, smeared and indistinct.Civil War framed the ethics of capturing violence. Warfare removes the frame entirely. There is no image here to interpret - just presence. Just event.It's also one of the most immersive war films I've ever seen, precisely because it refuses to explain itself. The film doesn't care if you're lost. It wants you to be. Questions pile up. None are answered. Context is treated like luxury, one the characters (and audience) don't get.By the final sequence, you feel exhausted - not thrilled, not moved - just emptied out. And then the film has the audacity to end on one word:\"Why?\"But it doesn't ask it to provoke. It asks it like a ghost would. Like a memory does. It's not a question. It's an echo.Warfare is not a film you watch. It's something you survive.9/10.P. S\nHaving experienced Warfare in Dolby Atmos, I must emphasize how sonically overwhelming the film's opening sequence is - a moment of almost euphoric surrealism, as the soldiers lose themselves in the pulsating rhythm of Call on Me, the bass resonating so powerfully it felt like the theater roof was coming down. It's a scene of unexpected levity and collective joy, rendered with hypnotic energy and tonal audacity. Precisely this striking contrast - between the almost absurd vitality of the prologue and the film's emotionally pulverizing, desolate conclusion - marks one of the boldest and most jarring juxtapositions in recent cinema.",

Garland is in love with slow-motion muted scenes portraying soldiers being shell shocked. You have to sit through at least 20 minutes of that. There really is no plot and unlike its name and the trailer it is not about combat and all it does is portray the horrors of war.Same as Garlands last bust, Civil War.

It's not for the faint of heart. Rarely has the raw horror of war been depicted with such intensity; I haven't felt this shaken since Saving Private Ryan. The theatrical experience is essential, this soundscape demands a massive screen. The gunfire alone rivals Heat in realism and impact.Those expecting a conventional narrative should adjust their expectations. This isn't a traditional hero's journey, it's an immersive, boots-on-the-ground depiction of a team navigating a chaotic operation where, even when everything is done right, everything can still go catastrophically wrong.Watching this, my respect for our military deepened tenfold. The courage it takes to step into such situations is beyond comprehension, and the professionalism of the operators is portrayed with remarkable authenticity. This film didn't just entertain, it inspired me to be a better leader, a better friend.This is the film I wanted Civil War to be, and I wouldn't be surprised if Alex Garland felt the same. It offered a deeper understanding of PTSD and the brotherhood forged in combat. The emotional and psychological toll is palpable, yet never overplayed.This is not just a film, it's an experience.

            "review": "There have been anti-bellicose films since the early days of cinema. You can trace a throughline from All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), to Paths of Glory (1957), and Platoon (1986). As the U. S. has extracted itself from decades-long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, more reflective films have started to emerge on those conflicts. While we've seen some modern anti-bellicose films like The Hurt Locker (2008), the genre has more often leaned toward propagandistic works such as Lone Survivor (2013), 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi (2016), or 12 Strong (2018). With time and distance, however, a more nuanced perspective is developing-one less interested in glorification or recruitment. We now see stories exploring overlooked aspects, such as the treatment of translators in Guy Ritchie's The Covenant (2023), and more recently, the visceral helplessness felt by soldiers in Warfare (2025).Warfare attempts to recreate, as faithfully as possible, a harrowing day in 2006 during the Battle of Ramadi, when a platoon of Navy SEALs was pinned down in a building. The platoon includes commander Erik (Will Poulter), head of comms Ray (D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai), sniper Elliot (Cosmo Jarvis), and soldiers Sam (Joseph Quinn) and Macdonald (Michael Gandolfini), among others.Directed by Alex Garland, following his similarly themed Civil War (2024), and co-directed by Ray Mendoza-one of the real soldiers portrayed in the film (played by Woon-A-Tai)-Warfare adopts a stripped-down, technical approach. There is no soundtrack to steer viewers' emotions, no hand-holding through military jargon, and minimal expository dialogue about the characters or their mission. We're dropped into a scenario where the soldiers are tasked with securing a compound as an observation post, and from there, the situation escalates-their primary objective quickly becoming sheer survival.With Garland's sharp directorial style and Mendoza's commitment to authenticity, Warfare avoids portraying the U. S. military as a glorified, video-game-like experience. The first act centers on the monotony of war-our characters mostly wait, bored but hyper-aware. When combat finally breaks out, Garland keeps the camera locked inside the house, emphasizing a suffocating sense of claustrophobia. Brief drone thermal images occasionally orient the viewer, but for the most part, the firefight is disorienting and tense. The soldiers fire out blindly, unsure if their shots land, spending most of their time hunkered down. A significant portion of the film focuses on the gruesome injuries sustained and the frantic, desperate efforts of fellow platoon members. Ideology fades quickly, replaced by a primal will to survive.However, Warfare does fall into a familiar trap of many American war films: it centers the suffering of U. S. soldiers while sidelining the pain of local civilians and collaborators. In the film, the platoon occupies the home of two Iraqi families, who are forcibly confined to a single room and largely ignored. Only in a final lingering shot do we see an acknowledgment of their experience, but by then, they feel like shallow afterthoughts rather than co-victims. Similarly, the local translators embedded with the platoon are given short shrift. Though the film briefly shows them being dismissed, berated, and even used as human shields during an evacuation, this disturbing thread is dropped and never revisited. It's a missed opportunity, especially when contrasted with Guy Ritchie's The Covenant, which centers its narrative around the complex relationships between soldiers and translators. The idea that Warfare is \"only about the American soldiers\" doesn't excuse this neglect-just a few more scenes could have offered a more balanced and humane perspective.The cast features an ensemble of rising stars-almost like a who's-who list of \"Top 10 Actors to Watch.\" Poulter, Quinn, and Jarvis shine with charisma despite limited character development. Charles Melton also impresses in a small but commanding role. Some of the other actors, however, feel a bit green: Woon-A-Tai seems out of his depth at times, and Gandolfini's range still feels confined to familiar \"wise guy\" territory. That said, the film's focus on physical endurance and survivalism means deep character work isn't central, and more instinctual, visceral performances prove effective.Warfare is a compelling anti-bellicose film, grounded in technical precision and immersive tension. Its dedication to realism and its refusal to glamorize war are commendable. While the marginalization of civilians and translators remains a significant flaw, the film succeeds in offering a grim, unflinching look at modern combat-a soldier-centric, rightfully distressing experience.",

Admittedly I'm a little biased because I spent a number of years supporting operators in this community, but watching this movie really hit me. This movie completely understands what we as service members care about and potentially go through in horrible circumstances. The movie throws a middle finger to narrative and just gives you the story as a handful of men experienced that day with no real bias. As far as accuracy I have to say they really hit the nail on the head! Comms saying 0 and not O(the letter), blood sweeps, and taking a knee one someone if you don't have a tourniquet are so fundamental to us, and it's the little details we appreciate for remembrance.

From the gunfire to explosions you feel every hit. The 'Show of force' they use NEEDS to be heard to be believed. I came out of the movie shaken tbh but really entertained and the time flew by.",

This movie was exactly what I needed to see in order to even begin to understand what my husband has seen and been through. From the clever use of sounds throughout the movie, the screams, the muffled chaos, to the over whelming chaos, every second is pure adrenaline and fight. This movie does a fantastic job of making you feel like you are right there with those men. You have to remember, a lot of our service members are young. Mine was 21 when he served in Fallujah, and this movie really helps transport me from my imagination of the stories he has told me to what was his reality at such a young age. I'm thankful for everyone that worked so hard to bring this movie to life for those who want a better understanding of what our loved ones have seen and been through. I truly believe that everyone should see this movie to gain a better understanding of what some of our service members go through.",

Script is almost non-existent. The CGI is noticeable. ZERO re-watch quality. I'm just a bit baffled as to why he made this...It started off well. I really liked the start of this and I didn't feel it slow .The soldiers hiding out in the civilian house with the enemy outside tension building, I found very engaging and a good initial set-up. But when the action happens the movie doesn't really go anywhere. It's just an immersive experience into frontline warfare. Garland's a big gamer so why not develop this into VR instead? Why make it a movie?I swear almost every war movie now has to rip-off the Spielberg shell-shock scene\nof Tom Hanks on the beach in Saving Private Ryan. Garland copies it here and it goes on too long.There's no music so there's no tension build up or memorable moments involving characters you actually care about. It's similar to American Sniper & Black Hawk Down, but I actually think there both better films than this. This doesn't feel like a film , it feels like a U. S. recruitment video for the military.I mean I get it. Depict war as raw and as real as it is. Salute to the hero's, but then do that as a TV documentary (which I think would've worked better) not as a movie. At least then you'd get some insightful interviews from the Navy Seals, and you'd care more for the characters. Then insert the dramatization/reenactments.A positive I will give it is the sound design. It was really effective and immersive, but overall don't waste your money on this.",

I went into Warfare with zero expectations and I came out rattled to my core. It isn't an anti war film like some people are suggesting, but rather an unbiased, matter of fact look on a very bad day in the life of a squad of infantrymen. Warfare benefits surprisingly from a loose story, basically no musical score, and finely tuned sound design to create what might be one of the most intense war movies I've seen in my life thus far.A+",

The movie feels a mix of documentary and bodycam footage, while the cast were comfortable in their respective roles.While the production and cinematography was very good, the real problem is that there's no context to the story or any empathic connection shown between the characters whatsoever. Warfare delivered the horrors of war but failed to deliver the reason or the backstory of the war and characters, both.

Although the congratulatory credits footage confuses that angle as we get to meet the real perpetrators of the events of the film.I was on board with the who futility of war, the meaningless nature of the soldiers taking over a random house, smashing down walls and taking captive the innocent families that live there and then having to defend themselves from attacks caused by the act of taking over a random house, hey how about just don't take the house, right?That seemed like a poignant message and if left at that then we've got ourselves a film with a solid message, but then we get the actual soldiers taking photos on the set with the actors and smiling, and the message about thanks for always answering the call\" and well maybe we're all just imagining there's a lesson learned here at all. You can't have a sobering film on the brutal insensitivity of the US Military and the pointless damage it inflicts on the innocent around the world and then go all hugs for the military bros as the credits roll, can you? It was a confusing message.It was a well made movie, fantastic sound design. I just don't know what I'm supposed to take away from it, and maybe that's part of the point, the world is full of contradictions.But I really did feel embarrassed and ashamed for the cruelty inflicted on the families we hardly saw in this film.",

Ortega transformation into Wednesday seems effortless, she has all the quirks, coldness and mean insults associated with her, but in such an expert hands, Wednesday does not seem cartoonish nor one-dimensional, she is portrayed with incredible depth.The series is also directed by Tim Burton, and his love for the macabre and Hammer Horror us incredibly noticeable here, and so is his dark sense of humor.The supporting cast is incredible as well, specially Emma Myers as Enid, her colorful personality are a surprisingly well match for our color deprived protagonist.If you were a fan of Wednesday Addams before you will love the series, id the character is new to you this series will make you fall for her.A Gothic murder mystery with a twist of irreverent dark humor, there are not enough words to praise this series.",

After all, there is a connection of Scooby Doo and the Addams Family as far back as the 70s.With the promise I made to my 10 year old niece, I forced myself to finish the first season. In the original review I wrote here, I was saying that: \"I'm at episode 3 and it is painful. It was a struggle to watch the first episode, but the more it goes on, the worse it gets.\"But before I (and others) come to conclusions, I (we) need to understand some things clear: This is a coming-of-age series made for the adolescents of today. It is not for adults specifically, it is not R-Rated and most of all, we must understand that the new generation of teenagers are different from the teenagers we were. The difference in generations must be taken into account. After all, those who are fans of the 90s movies (like myself) will also see the 60s series differently, and the 60s fans (such as our parents) will see the 90s movies differently. I'll come to this subject again later in the review.Now my thoughts.While this has all the necessary 'tools' to be great, it just isn't (in my opinion). We have a cast with great actors such as Christina Ricci, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Luis Guzman, Gwendoline Christie and the new star Jenna Ortega who is really really good. We have Tim Burton who directed four episodes. We have music of Danny Elfman on four episodes. We have Romania, who could've been used as it is, instead of turning it into an American land. Even with all of this, it just couldn't deliver (to me).It has nothing to do with the madness of the Addams Family tradition, it's more like a fantastic world of J. K. Rowling after listening to Bauhaus, while at the same time talking in teenage internet language. Painfully cringe, many times predictable. All the goth stuff you can think of, it's here, but presented in a way that is, like I said, cringe. I'm expecting that in a future episode we'll see Wednesday drinking absinthe in a cemetery and reading Poe's poems, or maybe using some Book of Shadows, Ouja Board and some occult-themed stuff (which wouldn't be new, but lets see how predictable this show will be). The grandiose moment when Wednesday pronounces \"mansplaining\", you know you got a Netflix production.While the Addams family of the 90s (both the movies and the animated series which I loved as a kid) had a darker humor that made you laugh, here I didn't even smirk. Maybe I'm just one of the old generation that is lost in the past and can't connect with today's generation, and I'm stuck with the rather more offensive, darker humor of those movies. The humor in here is just too mainstream, too gentle, too cliché. Looking at the high praises given here in the reviews, and then going to the profiles of the people who wrote them, I understand that this is a tv series that is great for the teenagers of today. The generations differ, that is clear in many aspects, and this is one example. That doesn't mean I'm right and they are wrong, of course. The same is for me, who as a 90s Addams Family fan can't really enjoy the first shows from the 60s to the fullest, or even the 1998 adaptations which were truly horrible (even though Nicole Fugere was great and I was in love with her when I was a kid). I didn't even bother to watch the 2019 and 2021 animated movies. So Wednesday 2022 is not the worst.Even so. You can't even tell it's a Tim Burton movie. I don't know what happened to Burton, but after Sweeney Todd he seems to have lost his brilliance. Yes, Dark Shadows and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children might have a bit of his touch, but not in the way we think of him. When you say Tim Burton you say Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow, Big Fish, Corpse Bride and even though not directed by him, the classic Nightmare Before Christmas. Adding an Addams Family would've been a must-have in his profile, but this one just didn't work out.The school for weirdos is actually more normal than the school I was at. The principle of the school (Gwendoline Christie) is out of character and more of a 'normie' than a 'weirdo'. The other actors are so plain that I can't even remember their names. There were those two teenagers in the bookshop trying to flirt as in a 80s teen movie. I don't remember their names, but that moment was so cringe I felt like screaming and slamming my face in the monitor. I guess I can be Wednesday too. I think that Thing has the best acting. Oh, and Christina Ricci is doing a good job at... whatever she's supposed to do/be in the film (later edit: found out her role in film and it's good, but her character's final discovery was made in a mediocre style). With all the respect I have for Catherine Zeta-Jones, she just doesn't make you feel like she makes a good Morticia, as for Luiz Guzman, again, not a good fit for a fantasy style movie (he will always be El Cid for me: from Oz). However, the worst character and actor here is Fred Armisen/Uncle Fester. When the guy came out I thought that he's like a villain from a Fox Kids/Nickeldeon/Nick Jr. Production who happened to steal Cruella de Vil's motorcycle while having Raiden's electric superpowers. What-is-this?! Compare Fred's Uncle Fester with Christopher Lloyd's Uncle Fester and you'll see the HUGE difference.There are some good things here and there, and the dance scene is indeed great, Jena's moves and stare are perfect! The scene when she speaks in German to the tourists is also great, and it's something that really brings the real character of Wednesday as known in the Addams Family tradition. The piranha scene is also characteristic to Wednesday we all know and love. The scene when she plays the cello is also amazing, it actually gave me chills (good ones). The sword fight is great as well, her fighting skills in general are great. \"Thing\" being portrayed very human-like in character/personality (like he's one who likes to take care of his skin) is really cool as well.Yes, goth girl goes to Hogwarts. This is so much like Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, Harry Potter, Scooby Doo and X-men that is so far from the original idea and charm of the Addams Family. Drop some teenage hormones, since it's a Netflix production, and there you have it. Enjoy the stew!Season 2 started well but went painfully cringe, again with all the Harry Potter stuff and some cultural references that would make any educated person cry for mercy.The beginning was ok, and I am under the impression that the dialogue has improved. It has more of the old school Addams Family vibe, with the dark humor and less cringe verbal expressions.... until Principal Dort comes into play and makes everything so cringe it makes you ashamed for watching this.Some scenes were creepier as well, with a bit of gory elements, that fit the Addams perfectly. However, other scenes just tormented me.A great surprise was a scene that is straight out of Tim Burton's old stuff, but I won't get into detail so I don't give any spoilers.It is sensational that great actors such as Christina Ricci, Luis Guzman, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Gwendoline Christie, Steve Buscemi and Christopher Lloyd didn't fit well in their characters. These might be their worst roles in their careers. Also, important characters such as Pugsley, Gomez, Morticia and Lurch were so terrible compared to The Addams Family movies. Jenna Ortega does a good job, but can't be compared to Christina Ricci's Wednesday (but still, Jenna does a good job).We must remember and accept that this is for the new generation, for the teenagers aged 12-15, not for the old generation. So for them, it's probably great. One good thing is that it's getting them used to the macabre and dark humor, not letting them be soft snowflakes.",

They literally called this a CW show with Wednesday Addams. I was shocked because I'll be honest this is probably the best experience I've had watching a show on Netflix since the first season of stranger things. Not only is it one of the best shows I've seen this year but it's probably one of the best things that Tim Burton has done in a very long time. Jenna Ortega is the best part of the show but all the other characters are extremely likable as well and nobody is perfect. Which is also the thing that I like the most is that everybody in the show is flawed. It's not super over the top cartoony dark like some of the movies are but it takes a little bit more of a realistic approach with the Addams family personalities and relationships. The Burton monster elements are still there though and they are awesome to watch. If you look at it more through the angle of Wednesday trying to find empathy and a reason to care about the people around her you get a lot more out of it. So for me personally I really don't understand why snobby critics just accuse us of being a cheesy teen drama with a consensus that you would see on CW... because it has a lot more to say than those types of shows and it's also very smart in the approach that they have with the Addams family and their relationship with each other and the people in the town that this takes place in.

I don't think this is \"updating\" the story but completely undermining what we loved about it to begin with. She doesn't seem sassy or funny just rude. The Addams's were always scrupulously polite - even to their enemies - it added to the humour and showed how classy they were, yet Wednesday is yet to offer a civil word to anyone.

Wednesday was my favourite character in the films, especially the second one when she and Pugsley got sent to Summer Camp...Christina Ricci in those films as Wednesday was floorless, and it was great to see her appear in this too. Ortega's turn as the main character was excellent she is quickly becoming a great actress. I think you need to give the series time to develop and remember that it's target audience is quite wide, I don't think it's meant to be too dark. Just like the 90s films it plays on the dark and morbid humour, but with the teen angst mixed in.Definitely worth watching if you are intrigued, but remember that it's not an 18+ rated adult only tale... it's a modern tale on these ever classic characters, think along the lines of the Netflix Sabrina series... If you liked that, then this should be right up your alley.",

Now I understand a show about Wednesday would have some of the teen angst and \"finding\" themselves but this tips right on over to a CW series. Did Tim Burton get gentrified? It sure seems like it. There is none of the character he usually brings to his projects. I think I really realized what it was when half way through first episode she runs into three \"normal\" boys who immediately try to beat this little girl up but of course she has her ninja moves and defeats them. This is the SECOND time she is attacked by a group of normal (they even tried some diversity with a black guy ringleader) teen age boys in the first 30 min of the first episode. There are bits to this that could have been fun or interesting Gwendolyn Christie is wildly under used. Catherine zeta-jones will never be mistaken for angelica Houston. I thought the Gomez casting was interesting as it did seem to be a closer match to the original comics. But again no one can touch Raoul Julia. I can see already where this series is going and I think it will be another that will flame out quickly for netflix.",

The cinematography is beautiful as well, everything is catered around Wednesday, so she stands out in every scene, even in a school full of \"outcasts\".

I absolutely loved The Terminal List starring Chris Pratt so I've been looking forward to this ever since they announced this spinoff a few years ago. This spinoff is a prequel story about Ben Edwards (Taylor Kitsch), who was in the first one but takes center stage here. I've been a fan of Kitsch ever since he starred in the amazing Friday Night Lights. He's awesome here too. Chris Pratt is also back as James Reece and even though he's just a supporting character in this series he's as good as always. It also stars a bunch of other great actors like Tom Hopper, Luke Hemsworth, Jai Courtney, Constance Wu, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Michael Ealy and plenty of others you will recognize. There is plenty of action and drama to keep you entertained throughout each episode.

Glad they dropped three episodes and two and three get into black ops and pursuing old foes.Watching Ben Edwards' journey is going to be fascinating-not only for the action, but because this series leans hard into the deeper questions. Characters are not just black and white; they live in the greys, wrestling with loyalty, betrayal, and the limits of violence. It asks, what is the cost of courage? May our courage exceed our level of violence.The show balances its intensity with a moral compass, unflinching in showing how blurred the lines can become when the mission and personal conviction collide. It brings to mind Owen's haunting words from The Pity of War: \"My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.\" That spirit permeates Dark Wolf-it's as much about the toll of choices as it is about bullets and missions.And the craftsmanship? On another level. The cinematography and music feel movie-quality, with a pulse that amplifies every scene. The acting and dialogue feel authentic, carrying verisimilitude rarely seen in modern TV.This isn't just a prequel but a spinoff-it's a continuation with its own grit, conscience, and style. If these three episodes are any indication, Dark Wolf is about to become appointment viewing. And watch some of the behind-the-scenes and promotions for this series, along with teasing more in the Jack Carr universe that is being developed. I've read each of Jack Carr's books, and I'm glad he is involved in fleshing out his characters more in this medium. This is an excellent addition to the Terminal List series.",

I WANT MORE!!!I has been like a reunion of sorts to be reunited with the characters that we know and love from the books, and to see such an incredible story written just for the show that treats the first season and the book with respect, while still standing on its own!The acting in this is terrific. Tom embodies the fan-favorite, Raife, in a way I didn't think was going to be possible (great job, dude) Loved him in Black Sails, and this blows that performance away. Dar brings Mo to life & Luke does Landry in such a way that I cannot picture Landry as anyone else now!! I was already looking forward to True Believer & even more so now! Boozer!!!! Jared Shaw returning as Boozer just makes me smile, because I wanted more Boozer in Terminal List. LaMonica Garrett was underutilized in Terminal List season 1. He's a significant talent, as proven in 1882. Seeing him reprise his role in such a strong way is also flat-out fantastic!!Let's not forget about the ladies of the show, either. Shiraz and Rona-Lee are both so believable and strong in their performances.Jack Carr must be one of the nicest, most loyal people alive. Or, Chris Pratt is. Or both. I love how they brought back the cast from Season 1, and how they continue to support those who supported them; as well as continue to develop these characters that us fans have invested in & grown obsessed with.If you like Historical fiction mixed with military and spy-movie qualities - THIS SHOW IS FOR YOU!

This makes it difficult to take the drama seriously, and the experience becomes frustrating rather than entertaining.It's a real tragedy, because the premise had so much potential.

This guy legit is a skilled actor, whether it's his action performances, emotional displays, or his perfect comedic timing and deadpan delivery. I mean wow, I'm hooked!At first I was wtf is this, especially the opening credit's dancing, then as I grew to know the characters better, and seeing Cena do things that I'd never thought I'd see filmed, I realized how genius and different this series was, and the more I watched, the more I wanted.I waited until all 8 episodes were released, and binged, and am glad I did. I may have lost interest or got too anxious in between releases, but in binging, I was glued to the TV and wanted more antics and craziness and I couldn't stop. I was addicted! Had I had to wait for the next episode a week later, I'd have withdrawals - it hooks you in that good!This is Gunn's greatest creation, and Cena's greatest performance, and it was pulled off with a low budget, so I can't wait till HBO throws money at Gunn for the next season due to its critical success. Everything on this show was near perfection; Gunn's directing and writing, all casting and performances - what a bunch of characters! The cinematography, visuals and S/VFX spot on. Eagly is my new favorite sidekick! And Gunn's choice of the soundtrack and score - amazing! I will be buying that soundtrack when available for sure!I applaud everyone involved in this little gem we all didn't know we wanted, but needed - a refreshing change in the typical superhero genre.

Everyone had a thing to latch onto or relate to. (Excluding the first team of course) everyone had something I could get behind even thought they were villains. Harley had relationship issues and the team helped develop her, bloodsport had daughter and father issues, polka dot man had mommy issues, ratcatcher 2 had issues as well and they had clear motives that drove their story that I could relate to.... Then you had... peacemaker, a man who's background was vague... especially when it was only a repeated line by Amanda Waller comparing his background to Bloodsport.... A man who is wanting world peace at all costs with no matter how many men women and children he has to kill to get it... what a scum bag.... Being one of the reasons why some important character met their demise I was not too fond of peacemaker.... But hey that's the point, he's a villain... so when the end credit scene played I'm sure I wasn't the only one trying to root for a specific someone to be okay... but nonetheless peacemaker was that someone.... Regardless, we made it up until this point.... All that buildup and universe Gunn has made all leads up to a spin off tv show that nobody asked for... and I gotta say.... It's absolutely delightful. John Cena Definitely shines in this role. He has a lot of charisma and development in the first episode alone that it helps actually understand why somebody can become as messed up as he is.

It also reeks of rather simple-minded PC agenda, including all the talking points of a typical European bureaucrat...\nAt the basis of the plot are two proverbial \"girl bosses\", each with all the bells and whistles of contemporary TV's depiction of a \"strong independent woman\", such as messy families, whiny unmedicated teenagers in tow, and blanked disregard for conventions. While they both are far from being stellar examples of a prudent politician, we are being shown how good and noble they are by resisting sinister white men on the other side. Thank heavens, at least the creators spared us from injecting a dose of \"evil Russians\" this time... Apart from corny political agitation, from the theatrics viewpoint, the series carries near zero suspense value, as all the baddies are identified pretty early, and not by investigative work of law enforcement, but are just shown to us in plain view, plotting their dark deeds.

In this case, the consensus is accurate, and that is:Seasons 1-6: outstanding. Deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy of Hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. GoT is worth watching for these seasons, definitely.Season 7: you suddenly notice the writing and plotting has taken a sharp dive downwards in quality. There are inexplicable ideas, inconsistent characterisation and soap-opera dramas. But at least the entertainment value is still very high, so it gets a pass.Season 8: this drop chasms down to depths you didn't think possible. The writing has got so amateurish that the still-fantastic production values are no longer enough to save it. If you ever enjoyed Lost but were amazed at how bad the final season was, you're in familiar territory here.The biggest problem with the final season was it took us out of the story and got us thinking about its many weaknesses. We lost our suspension of disbelief. Fatal for fiction. It also ruined the series-arcs to the point where a rewatch of the entire series is pointless.So can I recommend a GoT marathon for newcomers? Yes, the first 6 seasons are worth the disappointments later on. But best series of all time it is not. It could've been, but dropping the ball in the final stretch puts it behind the following superior series more worthy of your marathon:Battlestar Galactica (2003-2008)Twin Peaks (all 3 seasons, plus the movie)Breaking Bad",

I think some people love the sound of their own voice and think their opinion is worth something and will be disagreeable simply for the sake of it.Having said that, this show is stunning. I have never read the books and now I want to. There is so much crap on TV that is renewed year after year (CSI, House etc.) which uses cheap gags, pointless and sometimes ridiculous plots, unbelievable and many times one dimensional characters and yet all the truly great shows get cancelled.There is enough brain-dead television. But once in a while a show comes along that transports you to another world and makes you believe in the magic of television again. Game of Thrones is one such show.It is complex, multi-layered, surreal, vibrant, imaginative and it draws your eye in to the surprising level of detail, from the sweeping vistas, to the narrow dungeons, from the beautiful castles and magnificent trees, to the contrasting landscapes. It is worth watching just for the scenery alone.Yes the acting seems a little cold and even wooden at times, but this is perfectly in keeping with the medieval look and feel of the show. Yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.The scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting, led by Sean Bean perfectly cast as Lord Edard. Although Sean Bean is better known for brooding bad guys, he strikes the perfect balance between father, husband and Lord and soldier. He is well supported by other well known actors and many new to the scene.After watching and sometimes enjoying Camelot, this show makes that one look more like \"Merlin\" by comparison. And where Camelot lacks in depth and scripting, Game of Thrones strikes the perfect balance between brooding medieval angst and wonderful fantasy story telling.Even if you have never watched a fantasy show before, you should not miss this.",

I initially get excited to see one of my favorite series on the big screen, and eventually walk away disgusted. For whatever reason, most shows and movies that are based on epic book series absolutely butcher the original content.So when I saw the preview for \"Game of Thrones\" on HBO, I was immediately skeptical. Oh, I was going to watch it, but I didn't have high expectations. I did hold a little hope because HBO is known for their high quality shows.I was absolutely shocked to watch the Pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. The language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. It stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it.The acting is superb and I actually felt like I was looking into Winterfell for the first time. I feel like I've actually got faces to add to the characters that I've been reading about for a long time.If you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from HBO to add some spice to the series. This is not the case at all. The books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the Pilot. I am very proud of HBO for producing an amazingly accurate product. I will be watching every week for sure.If you enjoyed what you saw in the Pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. \"Game of Thrones\" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. I would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.UPDATE:I have now watched 3 Episodes and I wanted to come back and report some more. Even after 3 Episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. Overall the acting is still very good. I hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script. I don't get this impression with this HBO adaptation.Each episode of this series leaves me itching for the next weekend. I really hate watching shows in real time because I enjoy absorbing several hours of a show at one time. But, a good show will keep you looking forward to it the whole week.A special note to viewers that have not read the books... Keep watching! This series has numerous twists and turns and full of epic battles and action. It may seem like it's taking a little while to develop, but the reward is well worth the wait.Even after 3 episodes, I would still highly recommend this to anyone.",

And I couldn't have been more wrong! Where do I start...The cast is great, though not amazing with one exception - Sean Bean is perfect for the role of cold master of the North, Eddard Stark. The setting, the atmosphere is perfect and not boring at all! Some scenes are just amazing and are exactly as written in the book - for example the scene where they find the wolves, the nature and the dialogs are just as they should be. Now to get to the part most people are interested in: What is this? What can I expect of the series?THIS IS NOT LORD OF THE RINGS. Now that I got that out, I can continue. The very idea behind the series is a lot different. It's based around great families on different sides of the world, the stories their members have to tell and the secrets they hide. And there are many secrets, You will have a chance to witness small portion of them in the first episode. If you cannot follow the story just yet, don't worry! It's meant to be like that, you will eventually get to know all the characters and get involved in the story so much you will BEG for next episode just to see what happens.What to expect? Plots, love, action, war, hatred, quite a few surprises and much much more... All that after the first episode. I really hope they will not ruin it as the series progress.Conclusion: Do not miss this! Yes YOU complaining that the book is better. And everyone else.",

But I must say that I was wrong and that the series is better than I thought it would be. Much better!While I watched the first episode I had the same excitement as the time when I first read the book. HBO has done a great job and they fulfill all my expectations. Sean Bean was born for the role of Eddard Stark. Costumes, scenes, actors, everything is done as it should be. Actors are perfect for the role they play in the series.For me the biggest surprise of the series I figure Daenerys Targaryen. Emilia Clarke actress who plays Daenerys Targaryen is more beautiful than I imagined it would be and more beautiful than is described in the book.The Wall is a lot different than I had imagined, but in a good way.The series revolves around Eddard Stark and his family. He has a wife and five children, three sons and two daughters. Eddard Stark is ruler of the North and close friend of King Robert who needs his help in ruling the Seven Kingdoms.The seven kingdoms, united under one ruler, have lived a life of peace and comfort since King Robert took the throne. But nothing is ever as it seems. Within the king's court there is murder and treason, with no one aware of what is really going on.

I could not fault it, however, after that things went downhill.When it came to Season 5, the author of the books (George R. R. Martin) and HBO had a disagreement. Martin wanted the show to run across more series, to give all his complex story lines the chance to grow & move at a natural pace. HBO declined and so he dropped off the project, which is extremely evident.Season 6 & 7, although flawed, were still watchable. The books & George's earlier comments paved the way for both seasons, but you could feel that the episodes lacked substance.This brings us to the latest season, and after 2 years of waiting expectations were very high. The first two episodes were very plain, the reunions were wonderful, however you could tell they were setting up for one of the biggest fights of the series, which had been greatly anticipated since Season 1. I tried to not to have too high of expectations, however the director referred to episode 3 as \"bigger than Helms Deep\" which is a comment that will always spark excitement.Episode 3 was so utterly disappointing, in every way. If you were somehow able to see through the intense darkness (what was the director thinking?) you will crumble to the poor decisions made by writers. I will not stem into this too much, but basically Dan & Dave chose to go down the Hollywood path, completely disregarding any real story or strategy. Episode 4 was equally as disappointing, which I was hoping would redeem the final season.The writers have ruined this final season by fast tracking characters (basically teleporting), making the smartest of characters docile, and letting plot armor protect 'favorites'. I am still going to watch until the end, but I thought I would warn any future viewer to prepare yourself, as there is nothing more heartbreaking than watching terrible writing ruin a otherwise tremendous series.",

The characters, cast, scenery, costume, etc., all looked incredible, and gave me the feeling that I was inside the books themselves. Although not every little detail was translated perfectly, and nor should they be, the pilot episode was a grand achievement.For all those Nay-Sayers out there: If you don't like the series, then you probably have never read the books or watched the countless behind the scenes trailers that helped those who didn't understand the complex storyline. Yes, this story is complex, its original, its fresh, and it is very exciting. The story line gets better with each episode. You also have to keep in mind that this story is an adult story, and as I said, it is complex. Simply put, HBO didn't dumb the story down, but rather remained true to the core of this epic fantasy. For those who have never read the books and found the pilot interesting, trust me it gets better and better. Stick with it.",

Then there is the inclusionary casting (the Mercians especially) and the scenes either exaggerating the role of women or voicing frustration with their political status. Of course there is a gay romance. The timeline is absurdly condensed and travel absurdly easy. This version of 1066 is happening in a different dimension. Worst of all is the contrived relationship between the two frenemies, Harald and William.Why does this show pretend that it's historical? Why not change all the names (they did change at least one) and present it as fully fictional? Actual fiction by Bernard Cornwell or George R. R.

I have no idea why the writers just decided to make most of it up.We have Anglo-Saxons wearing tartan, the armour is largely wrong as our most of the architecture.

There have been a good few straight to DVD movies over the last 15-20 years which on the whole have all been garbage. The BBC's King and Conqueror series offered a real chance to do it right. Sadly it has not.There will be people who aren't so historically minded that will enjoy this series as a period, sword and shield, kings and queens type show but the reality is it's just not been done well. Even taking out the constant liberties it takes with the real history the script, costume and acting are on the whole just bad. At times the acting feels wooden, forced and not believable. The writing again at times, not always, lacks imagination and is plain boring. There are no moments that cause you to take any real notice of the show.The racially diverse cast does also take away from the ability of a show like this to immerse you in the period. When you watch a period piece you want to feel like you are watching that time period. There are some shows from the last 20 years that do this, HBO Rome, the earlier seasons of the Last Kingdom, even The Tudors all all its historical liberties. These shows actually make you feel like you could be watching the period it's trying to recreate. But King and Conqueror, with a black Earl of Mercia and a black Thane Thomas, it detracts from the ability of the show to pull you into the time period. Whilst I do not doubt there were black people present in Anglo Saxon England they would have been extremely rare and in some parts of the country almost a myth. I do not take away from the skill of Jason Forbes and Elander Moore who on the whole act well along with Nikolaj Custer-Waldau but again just make it at least a true reflection of society at the time.It is a shame that this show was not done better. I've anticipated it for the last year and it's fallen flat in my opinion. Edward the Confessor was also portrayed as a weak puppet. I don't doubt he was a very pious and indecisive man but there is evidence he enjoyed hunting and other more manly, kingly pursuits of the time.

This series is like an American version of those Korean or Taiwanese screaming, tearing, slow-paced TV drama shows. Don't get me wrong. Those kind of shows are extremely popular in Asia and my mother loves them except me. I agree that everyone has standards when it comes to show and film; however, this as the best in America where Hollywood resides... NO. Well, comparing to others, it could be the best and that's why I gave it one star rather than none.\"Slow-pacing\" is perceived differently. I don't consider \"Tree of Life\" as slow-paced and I think it is one of the most inspirational movies ever made. \"Tree of Life\" conveys ideas with a flow of images more often than words. Through images and occasional dialogue and narratives, it leaves bread crumbs for audience to find the clues. I thought it was brilliant and the way, it showed me, intrigued me and carried me emotionally to the end.Now, about \"Breaking Bad,\" it is very slow-paced because it showed me everything and that wasn't enough, it also told me everything. I got bored in the middle of first season but I really tried to like the series so I continued. I even started to draw (my past time hobby) while \"watching\" the episodes because I didn't really have to watch it anymore. Just by hearing it, I could learn everything about the story.The WORST was all the screaming, yelling, arguing and tearing. Well, that wasn't as severe as Korean/Taiwanese drama shows, but it was just too much for me. I guess that is why it is so popular ... I mean look at all the reality shows. Doesn't the audience love reality TV people yelling at each other in TV? 9.5/10 on IMDb ... well, Iron Man 3 has 7.4/10 and tree of life as 6.7/10. This tells me everything and so sad ... so sad.",

He has that rare gift of generating sympathy and manic-energy at the same time.For those that would be content to label this show a Weeds knock-off, bear in mind that Breaking Bad is a new kind of monster. It touches on the very same themes, \"living realistically as a middle class in the United States\" which often makes us resort to extremes to survive. Like the mother and daughter team that robbed that bank. But the weed selling antics of Showtime's hit show is really nothing like \"Bad.\" The Pilot was about as perfect a Pilot as I've ever seen, and much of it rests on Bryan Cranston's shoulders.Cranston plays Cheimstry teacher Walter White. He has a loving wife, a child with Cerebal Palsy and another is on the way. He also happens to be dying from an inoperable lung cancer situation, which happened although he \"never smoked.\" His finances in disarray, the once great student of science turns to crime to solve his problems.He cooks Crystal Meth with a good for nothing ex-student. From the antics of the first episode, the show is leading towards a dark place, but a place of truth. This is a no nonsense black comedy.For people that love Tarantino or the Coen's, this might be your cup of tea.",

The pilot for this series is a definite \"Must See\", and stands with the greats of Action/Adventure Television and Cinema. This segment begins at such a giddy peak, that you think the only way forward would be to tell the tale as a long flashback. However, through a marvelous piece of editing and writing, the plot miraculously moves forward from that point. Bryon Cranston's idiosyncratic performance is a joy to behold. He embodies a man who is against a rock, and an even harder place, who has no other option but to throttle his higher aspirations and grimly carry on. His solace and validation in middle-class morality and virtuous conduct is long gone. I eagerly look forward to more of this ambitious, entertaining series.",

There has been nothing except The Sopranos and Family Guy in the realm of series that warranted my attention. Almost everything out there is stupid drivel that insults the intelligence of educated human beings.But Now !! Now we have Breaking Bad !!!All I can say is: HOLY S**T !!! This is the best television series I've ever seen, and really goes into the realm of feature films as well, as far as being in my top ten. I cannot think of anything as of late that punched me in the face like this show did. I absolutely love it. If you have not seen it, do yourself a HUGE favor and rent the first season so you'll know what's going on, and you can see the transition of the characters. This show is beautifully written with plot twists coming in refreshing ways, and at just the right times. Some of what is shown I was surprised they put it on television,... and that's a great thing !! The acting is brilliant, and the themes are amazing, timeless and timely, and are presented to us in thought provoking ways that leave me pondering philosophical ideas long after the show is over. Yeah, this is a TV series !!! On AMC !! Hard to believe. This is one I'm raving about to everyone I know, and hope keeps going for a long, long time !!! Thanks to everyone involved with this genius show !!!",

I kept hearing how good it was and I kept saying: \"No thank you\" Last January I got sick, one of those illnesses you can't quite figure out. Maybe it was pre and post election depression, I don't know. But I stayed in bed for almost 10 days and then it happened. I saw the first episode and I was immediately and I mean immediately, hooked. I saw the entire series in 9 days. Voraciously. Now I had time to reflect. Why I wonder. When I think about it the first thing that comes to mind is not a thing it's Bryan Cranston. I know the concept was superb as was the writing but Bryan Cranston made it all real. His performance, the creation of Walter White will be studied in the Acting classes of the future. He is the one that pulls you forward - as well as backwards and sideways - then I realized that his creation acquired the power that it acquired, in great part thanks to the extraordinary cast of supporting players. I could write a page for each one of them but I'm just going to mention Aaron Paul. I ended up loving him. I developed a visceral need to see him find a way out. Well, what can I tell you. I know that one day, maybe when my kids are old enough, I shall see \"Breaking Bad\" again. I can't wait.",

            "review": "As the clueless, hapless and hopeless father of four on the celebrated series MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE, Bryan Cranston came into his own, as he did an amazing balancing act that juggled slapstick, pathos and insanity all at once, proving that not only did \"father NOT know best\", but more than likely never would.Now he essays the role of another father in the new series BREAKING BAD, but it's a shocking, bracingly refreshing turn that takes his 'Three Stooges' repertoire of grunts, shrieks, barks and neurotic ticks and virtually throws them out the window. Some of those qualities are still there, but unlike MALCOLM, BREAKING is the blackest of black comedies. When I first heard about it, the reviews I read compared it heavily (and favorably) to the Coen Brothers' dark crime comedy FARGO. And the comparisons are aptly warranted.This is one of those series where the less you know about it going in, the better, but just to set your mind reeling with the possibilities, here it is in a nutshell: Cranston plays high school chemistry teacher Walter White, who is constantly battling the lackadaisical attitudes of his disinterested students, the looming specter of financial disaster - by supplementing his paltry teacher's salary with a second job at a local car wash, and trying to cope with the impending arrival of a new baby, even as he and his wife raise their disabled teenage son, whom unlike many stereotypical portrayals of handicapped kids is no Pollyanna-like angel.Then in the midst of all this, Walter makes a shocking discovery: he has inoperable lung cancer, and therefore only a few years left to live at best. Facing the very real possibility of leaving his family struggling not only with his death, but a financial situation that could only end in catastrophe, Walter suddenly has a revelation, thanks to an idea handed to him by his boorish brother-in-law, who works with the DEA - he decides to become a crystal meth dealer.Okay, so while you're letting your brain take that all in, you also need to know that this is one of those defining roles where you just know that the lead actor will get Emmy recognition, whether he intended to or not. That is just how good Cranston is as Walter. In fact, he's every bit as good as Michael C. Hall's Dexter Morgan, James Gandolfini's Tony Soprano or Harold Perrineau's criminally under-appreciated Augustus Hill. And he's backed by an amazing supporting cast of mostly new or unfamiliar faces (with the exception of Dean Norris as the brother-in-law).You can tell from the word 'go' that writer/producer/director Vince Gilligan (former head writer/exec producer on THE X FILES) has been champing at the bit for a while to let fly with a project like this. And if the first episode is any indication, AMC has another real winner on its hands. So MAD MEN will need to move over and make some room...since BREAKING BAD isn't the kind of series to \"ask nicely.\"Which brings up another important point: this is not a series for everyone, the way that FARGO and Showtime's kindred-spirit drug dramedy WEEDS are not mainstream, either. This is sharp, biting, satirical social commentary that draws blood when it sinks its teeth in, and you are guaranteed to wince even as you laugh out loud at Cranston's dead-on portrayal of a MAN on the edge of a nervous breakdown (well, more like over the edge.)A caveat for would-be viewers, though, and a very ironic one at that: AMC has applied its ham-fisted method of editing its movies to this series as well, unfortunately, making the channel the LAST place you want to see it. The best thing to do is to check out the premiere episode whenever you can catch a rerun on AMC, then hustle on over to iTunes and download it so you can watch it again. Some very important scenes and some impressive establishing shots have been \"edited for time and content\" from the broadcast version, and this is material that IS essential to your experience viewing this show. There is a lot more to the characters and situations than you will be allowed to see on basic cable. So as you watch, keep that in mind.And after you are done marveling at this magnificent character study sketched in desperation, you can wonder as I did, whether Bryan Cranston will bother preparing a speech for next year's Emmys. I sure hope he does...thanks to his work on BREAKING BAD, he'll need it.",

Definitely not for everyone but finally something that feels real.I personally like the fact they pull no punches. I find myself pausing at the fact that I am so intrigued by this hard core street wise program, more than any of the other big name series. This one really hits home and gives a true behind the scenes look at what most would consider the bad guys. I'm not condoning the contents of the story, and I don't think the show is either, there is no glamor in what these boys are doing, but it's giving an insight to the darker side of many streets.How the denial and desperation that can occur to the common working stand up citizen, the pillar of society that suddenly changes his moral standing in a society driven by the almighty dollar. This is pretty dam close to Fallen (Michel Douglas) but with up to date street smarts nd a lot more punch.The characters don't over exaggerate their roles and the story line isn't filled with cleaver dialog or near to impossible feats of bravery or beating impossible odds. Just true to life screwed up events that could take place in the real world. I think they did their research on this one. Good work everyone.I hope we get more than a second and third season out of this great crew (every one of them).

'Breaking Bad' had that effect on me, and its reputation as one of the best, consistently brilliant and most addictive shows in many years (maybe even ever) is more than deserved in my eyes. Its weakest season is perhaps the first season, understandable as any show's first season is the one where things are still settling.Actually everything is established remarkably from the very start, but once the writing and characterisation becomes even meatier the show reaches even higher levels.Visually, 'Breaking Bad' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.The writing for 'Breaking Bad' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The direction couldn't be better.Can't say anything bad about the acting. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal as one of the most fascinating anti-heroes, or even of any kind of character, in either film or television. Aaron Paul has never been better and Anna Gunn is affecting. The characters are compelling in their realism.Overall, describing it as brilliant doesn't do 'Breaking Bad' justice. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

A show which doesn't preach, insult or attack it's audiences or tries to force-feed a specific message of anykind. It is a series that is unabashedly entertaining, interesting and a pleasure to watch start to finish. The themes and ideas of this show are woven into the storyline and plot points as well as the journey of the characters. No empty virtue signalling or moral grand-standing here.\"The Terminal List\" is an edge of your seat mystery-spy-action-thriller with a healthy dose of revenge seeking thrown in there, one that while not necessarily breaking any new ground (there are other similarly-themed series and movies of varying levels of quality) still manages to feel fresh and put it's own spin on the genre.The show is not necessarily an easy watch and is at times grim and darkly-themed. But that is part and parcel of the story and the different paths the characters have to undertake. Which is also what makes for such compelling viewing.Some may point to perhaps the overly long run of the episodes. I personally, do not mind that one bit. The series is eight episodes long...and you actually get your money's worth. I am sick and tired of these series that are only six to eight episodes, where individual episodes sometimes a have a forty minutes or less runtime...looking at you Disney Plus! Besides, this is actually a positive, because it allows the show to breathe, the story to unfold properly and the characters to actually develop in a meaningful way.In addition, perhaps most importantly, this a very solid, well made, cast, acted, written and directed series. I am aware that it is based on the books by James Carr (I'm assuming this series will get more seasons), which I have not read. It speaks to the effectiveness of the series, that it draws those like myself, who have not read the source material, to this world and characters. Of special mention is the pilot/ first episode, directed by Antoine Fuqua himself, who puts on a clinic on how to properly start a show and set the tone. Chris Pratt is no doubt a standout here but by no means the only one. Taylor Kitsch, Constance Wu, JD Pardo, Riley Keough, Jane Tripplehorn, Jay Courtney are all good in their respective roles, as are others not mentioned here. The cinematography, action sequences, the music also nicely round off the whole deal.\"The Terminal List\" is an example of talented people in front and behind the camera, working on a project they care about and are invested in.",

But, the embodiment and spirit is alive and well through the eyes of Lucy McLean (Ella Purnell) a vault dweller who hasn't had to experience real adversity in life.If you've seen \"Blast From The Past\" (1999) a lot of this will be familiar. Though not as dark, it took the simple sweet naive character of Brendan Fraser and put him in real world Los Angeles. Same here. Except MUCH darker.The humor is dark as well. What director Jonathan Nolan did so well is to incorporate a sense of futility in the lives, similar to game play.The lighting and camera work are spot on to the game. You can tell they REALLY studied it. A lot of places, if you've played the game, will seem very familiar. But also, it's just different enough where you don't roll your eyes thinking it's all fan service. He integrates small things like Cram and Nuka Cola with such ease, it's almost like the meme where Leo DiCaprio keeps pointing at the screen to get your attention.The eye popping primary colors of the 50's/60's era is in full swing. If you can't tell the difference between film and digital, this puts your eyes to ease. Clearly this was a film shot movie. Glossy in texture, they lean into the fringe edges.Not that any viewer would intellectually care, but you really feel the Wasteland.Again, if you played the game, you know how many worlds they can explore here.'\nActress Ella Purnell plays the wide-eyed vault child perfectly. She's sweet and wholesome in a newly brutal world. Similar to Sandra Bullock's portrayal of Leona Huxley in \"Demolition Man\" Though not necessarily excited for a bygone era.The characters she encounters only beefs up the idea of how over her head she's gotten herself into.The setup does feel a little rush. It begins with just absolute brutality. Yes, this is introduced. But, it really plays like the game. Where violence is dismissed quickly. If you haven't played, it's going to be a little off-putting. But it does make sense. It took me off guard for a moment. The idea is to get that open world feel and this series does it perfectly.This is one of the video game series I am absolutely excited to see continue. There is SO much to mine and I'm ready for it.Well done all!",

I normally would not write a review, but after reading the typical \"DEI\" 2 star reviews by people who it is obvious have not even watched the show, I felt obliged to tell people that it is in fact a good show. It does not preach any sort of political message. The cast is excellent. It is a blend of fallout, western, and some gory flick that I can't quite name. I'm serious about the gore, you are going to see some heads explode. It is the best TV adaptation of a video game to date and I highly recommend that everyone give it a chance. You will enjoy it.",

            "review": "THIS is how you make a video game to movie/tv show series. THIS is how you pander to gamers while appealing to new audiences. THIS is excellent 21st century entertainment.I won't waste time explaining the premise, I'm sure you've gotten the gist by now from other reviews. Just know that it seems like gamer who are fans of the game series (such as myself) are quite happy with it, and that people unfamiliar with the game series (like my wife) are also engrossed with this show.SO MANY REFERENCES to the game makes it fun to watch as a long-time gamer fan. Everything, from junk decor like magazine racks and plastic jack-o-lantern buckets, to power armor, enemies, factions, food, chems, characters, and weapons, is familiar.Sure, it may be a bit overproduced, have some cheesy and weak CGI effects, and contain a lot of the \"modern formula\" in its script and story. Aside from that, it's got everything anyone would want for a riveting sci-fi, action, drama, comedy, horror adventure. Seriously, this show, like the game series, covers all the bases.And oh my goodness, mini fan-gush moment here, but, I was so excited to hear Matt Berry's voice, I was totally not expecting it, and it was an awesome cameo as one of the easily recognizable robots in the universe of Fallout. And let's just say his is not the only shocking and awesome cameo in the series. Fans of shows like Archer might be pleasantly surprised in Episode 6.What's also so cool, is that like the stories you run into in the game, there are a lot of really interesting plots with crazy twists. The vaults may seem more like a paradise than on the surface, but when you dig deep, sometimes, the vaults are scarier than reality under the sun...Fallout has been around for two and half decades, and it's taken them this long to finally come out with a tv/movie adaptation? You know what? Since they nailed it, I'd say it was worth the wait.",

            "review": "Like many other reviewers here, I am a diehard fan of the Fallout games. My introduction to the game series began 25 years ago when I picked up a copy of Fallout 2 and I've been hooked ever since. Never, in all that time, had I ever wished for a spinoff TV series to be made about it. Who asked for it? Not me! But nevertheless, here it is. It exists whether we like it or not and no matter how many negative reviews people submit based on pride, protest, or principle it will not change that fact. Look, no one is forcing anyone who strongly objects to this series to watch it (not yet anyway). But if its mere existence truly offends you, just don't watch it! What is there to gain by coming here to thumbs down positive reviews because you are so aggrieved? Anyone and everyone is free to ignore the show, just like I'm choosing to ignore the sense of entitlement these petty review-bombers have by giving this new series the glowing review it rightfully deserves based on the merits.With that business out of the way, my review here is for anyone with a sincere interest in this series in deciding whether they should give it a chance. And to that I say yes, absolutely you should whether you are a fan of the games or not. As I previously mentioned, I never asked for this show and was prepared to hate it. But I kept an open mind as I watched and did my best to be fair in my overall judgement. And the truth is, the show is actually pretty fantastic. I was not prepared for it to be as good as it is. This show definitely caters to fans of the franchise with its high attention to detail and faithfulness to source material. I sympathize with those who would have preferred that Hollywood not make the series in the first place, but at the same time, now having watched it, the hate towards it is pretty unjustified if the only crime is that it exists.To the angry Fallout fans I ask you this: Imagine a TV series is being made about this game that you and I both love. Imagine that it's completely out of your control, and production is actually happening. If a Fallout series HAS to exist, what exactly would you want it to look like? Would it not be similar to exactly what Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy have created? I mean, visually it's pretty spot on. They've built an immersive world that feels very authentic. It feels like Fallout, it looks like Fallout, and it sounds like Fallout. Okay, maybe you would have preferred the show was modeled after the Interplay games and not Bethesda's Fallout 4, or maybe you would have preferred the show runners double and triple check the accuracy of the lore because you find any cannon inconsistency unforgiveable.So let's address the elephant in the room: Yes, there are some glaring lore issues. But it doesn't bother me. Why? Because a TV series is a different medium for storytelling than a video game. For the sake of argument, let's assume this new series runs for 8 seasons with 8 one-hour episodes each. That's a total of 64 hours screen time. That's just a fraction of what most people put into playing a single game. I've put hundreds of hours into Fallout 4 alone. When playing a game, you have the luxury of time to explore it and study it as much as you like. That's the beauty of Fallout games. But television doesn't work that way. It's not interactive. The entertainment comes from literally just sitting in front of a screen and watching/listening to a story. Viewers are going to tune out fast if it becomes overly pedantic and boring. Sometimes it is necessary to truncate and/or modify original source material so that it translates better on screen and can hold the viewers' attention.For me personally, as a longtime fan, what mattered most was that the series captured the spirit, message, and immersive atmosphere of the games. No matter what, it needed to look and feel like Fallout, and Nolan and Joy nailed it. I don't know what more they could have done to make the series better than it is, and I'm honestly relieved that the creative liberties taken were not so egregious as to disrespect the entire franchise and its fanbase. On the contrary, they've done an excellent job here. They could have reimagined Fallout into some truly terrible fan fiction, but they didn't. It feels like a true extension of the Fallout universe and that's all I had hoped for. Jonathan Nolan made this series because he is also a fan and avid player of Fallout games. If anyone could pull it off, it was him.",

But somehow, the show manages to be both boring and forgettable.The problem is that Fallout is all style and no substance. The characters are all one-dimensional stereotypes, and the plot is predictable and cliched. The show also suffers from a serious case of tonal whiplash, veering wildly from comedy to drama to action without any real sense of cohesion.As a result, Fallout is a show that is easy to watch but difficult to care about. You might find yourself watching an episode and then immediately forgetting everything that happened. It's the kind of show that you'll never binge-watch or even rewatch.It's a shame that Fallout is such a disappointment. With all the talent and resources behind it, it should have been a lot better.

This show does a really good job of nailing the feel of the games, with it's mix of gore and wacky humour.All three protaganists are interesting to watch but I particularly liked The Ghoul, who had a strong backstory, and the Vault Dweller, who's naivety made for quite a few laughs.The locations in the show were styled on the game and were true to the game. Although, they were all smaller locations. There were no wanderings in large, destroyed cities. I guess that would have meant a bigger CGi budget, so it's understandable.Also, it would have been nice if there was more danger in the wasteland created by the multitude of creatures from the game. This felt a bit neglected in the show. Again, I suspect this would have added to the budget. Perhaps these small quibbles could be rectified in Season 2. Surely there will be a Season 2 as this first season is surely going to be a success.I absolutely loved the way the plot threads came together in the last episode. It was really satisfying and leaves room for the story to continue.One last point. I've played and been a fan of all the games over the past few decades and find the 1-star reviews from fans of the game to be very strange. What are your expectations? You have to give the writers the chance to tell a story about characters in the Fallout World and they've done that very well. The set designers, costume artists, etc have nailed the style too, so how can this be a 1-star show? Insanity!",

Sure, there's a general plot that is followed in each episode. Unfortunately, the writers don't seem to want to actually tell a good story, they just want to set up individual scenes that are loosely tied together... and don't even get me started on the plethora of plot holes and inconsistencies.On a positive note, the show does a good enough job of capturing the look and feel of the Fallout world. However, it does not seem to populate that world with all of the enemies and monsters that you would find in the game. It gives you a few ghouls and radroaches here and there, but the actual Fallout world is teeming with these, as well as an abundance of other nasties to be dealt with.Overall, I was very disappointed with this because, as the title says, I expected greatness and I got mediocrity.",

All the Fallouts were weird *especially* the original isometric ones (1 and 2). The Brotherhood of Steel, the vault dwellers, raiders, and quirky side characters are all true to the games. The over the top gonzo violence and the retrofuture dystopia are also straight from the game. The series song choices of 50s crooners set to a new context also is true to the game.

I've played it a few times when visiting a friend, but I never owned the game myself. And this was about 25 years ago. The only thing I remembered was it involves armed vehicles.I went in with low expectations given the terrible history of video game movies/shows. But we have been on a good streak lately (Sonic 1/2, Mario, Gran Turismo). And I'm ecstatic to say that the streak continues with Twisted Metal.It hooked me immediately. I love the tone and over-the-top nature. I love that it doesn't hold back with the violence and blood. I love all the comedic attempts, with so many of them being memorable. I love the two leads, I didn't know Mackie could play funny/slightly goofy.But the thing I loved the most, and it's not even close, is SWEET TOOTH!!!! He's so awesome. I've never liked clowns. Never been scared of them. Just never saw the appeal. So for me to like him this much is saying a lot. The show is elevated every time he's on screen.At first I couldn't tell who was voicing him. I kept wondering, who is the actor fully bringing this character to life? Who is the one making this sadistic psychopath so likeable? Of course, it's Will Arnett. What a beast. He's able to bring so much to the table with his voice, as we've already seen with his performances as Lego Batman and BoJack Horseman.(EDIT: I should have my Nolan card revoked for forgetting about Joker in The Dark Knight. But I never really saw him as a clown. He's more like an endlessly intriguing character who dresses like a clown. But if you include him, Sweet Tooth would be second.)This show is highly efficient. It doesn't meander. It does so much with so little time. Most shows these days are terrible at that, especially streaming ones. I also love the song selections on this soundtrack. Some are late 90's/early 2000's songs I love and still listen to. Others are songs I haven't heard in decades. The choices seem odd but all work. Never in a million years would I have thought a scene playing the Thong Song would give me goosebumps.In conclusion, YES and GIVE ME MORE!EDIT: On second viewing, it didn't hit as hard. I still enjoyed it but not as enthusiastically as the first time. Changing season 1 rating from 8 to 7 stars.Season 2: 3 stars (1 viewing, 8/28/2025)Wow. What a nosedive. I hated this season. I had to force myself to finish it. I can't explain exactly why, but here are a few things that contributed.-For a game where they're meant to kill each other, the frequently don't. And I'm not talking about the ones that are friends. So much of this season doesn't make sense in general.-They jumped the shark with how goofy it is. Vermin is the best example. Horrible.-In season 1, Sweet Tooth was menacing and beastly. In this season he's unintimidating and kind of a joke.-In this hell of a post-apocalyptic world, so many of the characters are good guys, working towards a righteous end. The show feels more nice than sadistic. We already have thousands of shows/movies with righteous characters. This should lean way heavier on the sadistic side.I'm so bummed. The only standout positive is the look of some of the car battles with cool colors, lightning, etc. I'll probably try season 3, but I'm not confident we'll get one after such a drastic nosedive.",

            "review": "Alrighty then. Well, I had no idea that they were turning this particular vehicle game into a TV series. And as I stumbled upon it by random luck here in 2023, I must admit that my initial thoughts were 'great, another game adaptation doomed to fail'. And let's just be honest here, as much as I enjoyed the games, there just isn't enough contents in terms of storyline to support something like a TV series. But bless director Kitao Sakurai for trying.And of course I opted to sit down and watch this TV series. However, after the first four episodes, I must admit that I was good and ready to give up and call it quits, because this was a drag and very disappointing. However, I opted to stick with it, and actually managed to sit through all ten episodes of season one.Episodes five, nine and ten were worth watching, the rest? Not so much. Yeah, for a ten episode TV series based on a game where the concept is vehicle destruction and mayhem, you would assume that you would get that in an abundance on the screen, right? Right! Well, wrong, because you hardly have that at all. Instead, you get a sappy soap opera set in a dystopian setting. And that just didn't really play out all that well.While \"Twisted Metal\" was supposed to be John Doe's (played by Anthony Mackie) and Quiet's (played by Stephanie Beatriz) show, it ended up being Sweet Tooth's (played by Joe Seanoa and voiced by Will Arnett) show. Hands down, it was the clown Sweet Tooth that carried this TV show, and he wasn't even in every episode.The dialogue had a lot of dark humor, which definitely added to the overall enjoyment of the ten episodes. Again, even with the dialogue, it was Sweet Tooth that carried the series.\"Twisted Metal\" from director Kitao Sakurai hardly does the games any justice. So don't get your hopes up. But then again, basing a TV show on the meager contents there is to the games, well that was just simply boiling soup on a flat broth.Visually then \"Twisted Metal\" was fair enough. I wasn't bedazzled or overly impressed with the special effects and CGI in the series, but it was sufficient and adequate enough for what it was, taking into consideration the premise of the TV series.I can't claim that season one was impressive or particularly entertaining, but at least it leaves the audience with a promise of turning future seasons into what the audience (and fans of the games) were waiting, looking and hoping for; vehicular violence and roadrage.My rating of \"Twisted Metal\", at least this first season, lands on a generous four out of ten stars.",

Even crying is pathetic and so fake. Everything looks really cheap.And now lets see what Twisted Metal is really about (and no, there are not one spoiler in whole description):Twisted Metal is a demolition derby that emphasizes the usage of ballistic projectiles, machine guns, mines, and other types of weapons (up to and including satellite-based weapons and nuclear weapons). Players choose a vehicle, and an arena-or a series of arenas in the story mode-to engage in battle with opposing drivers. A variety of weapons and upgrades are obtainable by pick-ups scattered throughout the stage. The last driver alive is the winner.Although each individual game features its own storyline, they all revolve around the eponymous \"Twisted Metal\": a vehicular combat tournament hosted once a year. In almost all of the games, the host is a man called \"Calypso\"; in the series' fourth installment, perennial contestant Sweet Tooth briefly takes over. The general goal is to destroy all opponents; apart from the other contestants, unique vehicles seemingly designed by the host themselves may stand in the competitors' path. The winner is brought before the tournament host, who will grant the contestant a single wish.The hosts of these games are the persons who are, through arcane means, capable of warping reality itself to grant the wish of the contest winner; however, there is a general \"be careful what you wish for\" theme in the game series, as nearly all of the winning contestants end up with \"not-so-happy\" endings, due to the skill and proclivity of the hosts for twisting the words of their wish around-often to deadly effect. The games in the series usually contain a healthy dose of dark humor.Update for season 2: Stopped after first 5 minutes and removed from all to watch lists. So the TV Show that is \"bassed\" on one of the most iconic video games can't even show that video game properly and making complete joke showing some \"sim rig\" that does not make any sense?I fell for it in season 1 waiting for something related to the game expect one character and the name I am not gonna waist anymore time on this bag of ....",

The trailer left me feeling like it looked ok, but would probably still be a let down. Just some cheap script they made to try and cash in on something.But I was wrong. The series is great! Alot for us Twisted Metal fans and alot for newcomers. They did a good job at turning a videogame series about car fighting into a series, with people on top of it. There were people in the video games of course but just characters, you just drove their cars.I will say this series is NOT meant to be serious or deep. It's just a fun entertaining ride of adult mayhem. Cars, guns, gore, language, action...etc. I'm only a few episodes in and loving it!I'll change my review later if for some reason the show becomes terrible. To note, you really don't need to know anything about Twisted Metal games to watch this.-now finished series-\nFinished the last episode and can say yes, the whole season was great. No spoilers but there was alot of reveals in the last two episodes when it comes to famous TM stuff. The final episode felt much like a actual TM battle.The series does have some pretty cheesy moments. But it seems to work in favor of it. I know they greenlit a season 2, I hope we get introduced to more characters/cars.While the show mainly focuses on the characters, there is just enough TM content that keeps us fans invested. And if you don't know TM lore, you probably will get all the exciting things you see. You will enjoy them, but the reveal may not mean as much to you.This all said I wouldn't mind if they toned down the cheesiness just a bit. While the show can be dark, I'd like it even darker. Twisted Metal Black had a very dark nature to it. Maybe next season they will get into the darker lore. Granted so far the series is filled with violence, gore, language so its NOT for kids in anyways.Oh and hint... next season will be more like TM then you realize.... ;)",

Anthony Mackie does a great job as the lead in this and the supporting actors/actresses also all do a pretty good job making this show worthy of watching. Some of it's ridiculous, but it's suppose to be. Just turn your brain off and you'll have a good time watching this.

It doesn't take itself too seriously, it doesn't try to do anything over the top. And it doesn't spend endless time trying to explain why things are what they are. They just go for it, hard and fast. I loved it. They finally made a series that was true not only to the spirit of the games, but also to feel.The story revolves around a guy named John Doe, and a girl named Quiet(at least for now). They meet in the wasteland of a world where the only real stable places are cities surrounded by walls. Between those cities is no mans land where everyone basically tries to kill everyone else. However that's where the \"milkmen\" come in, they're drivers who deliver packaged between the walled cities. And so the story begins.10/10 this adaptation did everything right, good cast, good crew, good plot.

Then the Spock with a face that exudes self irony, and a voice that does not match the ironical baby face. Then the crew - good for having women - by do they all have to be so obnoxious? I mean, being a woman, am I allowed to wonder why objectifying women in the past excluded the average looking ones in favour of the sex bombs, and non objectifying them in the present shows excludes the average looking ones in favour of the weirdly looking ones? Probably not allowed to wonder about that, so, moving on... Why are the credits written in a font that makes the viewer unable to see and read the names?! Why is the plot so thin and full of propaganda?!Again, using a SF show as an allegory for current times issues may be OK, but the talent and artistic take are in showing it and making people think about the connections, not just telling it, like the propaganda department of the unique political party in charge... and in ST. SNW the propaganda was told, and it came off as awfull, and showed how not in contact with the masses psyché some people seem to be... Yep this planet is going to the toilet, slower or faster, rather faster than slower. But what is even worse is that the people have stopped hoping for good things, feel powerless, weak, poor and robbed of their lives! Saving the planet might work, in a close shave, but saving humanity or the people... nobody seems to care.ST seemed a franchise that cared about life, and people... this new iteration makes me really wonder if it was the old series that fooled me, or if the new ones have strayed off the initial path...

It did not take itself too seriously, at the right times.Stories that leaked about series development, indicated that Anson Mount had a number of conditions, for taking the role. I am pleased that he persisted and persevered, and has taken the rigid \"starch\" out of the captains uniform -- present in every series after TOS.I am also VERY impressed with the rest of the casting. And, I hope they explain why the bridge is mostly female -- which is absolutely WONDERFUL! The rethinking of Nurse Chappel's character is compelling. The casting of Babs Olusanmokun as the Doctor is genius. Christina Chong as security chief (a position that didn't exist in TOS) brings a spirit reminiscent of Cara Gee in The Expanse, and manifests Gene's vision realized in ST:TNG.Let's face it, ST:TOS was full of mistakes, inconsistencies, and many rediculously bad stories. ST:SNW isn't perfect either, but is clearly making the best effort yet.And yes, screenwriters of today are less literate and don't do their homework or research. ST:DIS confused flaunt with flout, and now ST:SNW confused com (communications) with conn (control). Even other reviewers spelled it wrong. To err is to be human.

It reeks of political bias and soulless corporate \"creativity-by-committee\". The whole alien plot was little more than a passive backstage for all of the above. THIS SHOW IS NOT ABOUT STRANGE NEW WORLDS.Context: When I saw the title \"Star Trek Strange New Worlds\" I thought maybe. Just maybe. It wouldn't be a political outlet, that they learned from fan outrage over ST-D and \"Not Halo\" that they would restart with a fresh approach.

I watched Deep Space 9 until the end (only 1 episode truly memorable) and I finally gave up on Voyager after about 3 seasons (what took me so long?). With Enterprise, I got as far as 2 characters smearing anti-radioactive goo on each other and thought, \"If I want to watch porn, I'll just watch porn \". I managed 1 episode of Discovery and 2 of 'Picard'. Whatever Star Trek has evolved into, it is not what beguiled me 5 decades ago. It has become the mouthpiece of writers and producers that believed Star Trek was all about social commentary and not science fiction or drama, with a little social commentary interspersed.So, now we have SNW - it looks OK, although the CGI for the title sequence is a bit dodgy and heavy handed. When will CGI effects teams ever learn that less is more? Still, the Enterprise looks familiar and although the shuttle in the opening sequence looked cartoonish ( especially when April stepped off it) I can accept that it, overall looks ok more times than it does not.The actors are fine. Anson Mount is a good choice for the part of Pike and manages to convey some of the jaundice that Jeffrey Hunter created in the character originally. Ethan Peck sounds so much like Leonard Nimoy, (with slightly more appealing looks), that I hope he takes over from Zach Quinto (who just looks pissed off all the time) in the movies real soon.So, with some good ingredients in place, what is missing? Well, look to my above criticisms of Trek since TOS and you find your answer.The opening sequence is peppered with social commentary. Pike lives in a house littered with 'antiques'. His ship's communicator lies next to an antique handset phone (presumably not connected or working) and his house in rural Montana is powered by a wind farm ( several giant wind towers required just to power his house?). So, the notion that older, simpler times were better and that Wind Power really is the energy answer for the future because it is still around in the 24th Century. Please.The premise of the whole episode is presaged by Pike watching 'The Day the Earth Stood Still'. Since this was the most interesting part of the episode I kept hoping they would return to it. Not directly. Instead, the writers paraphrase it and insert images of the recent White House riots to illustrate the beginning of WW3 on Earth. Not subtle and a political statement of the kind the original series was always wise enough to steer clear.Then there is the schmalz. Characters behaving as if they are excited to 'Go Boldly' when I presume that's what they have trained for over the past few years. Can you imagine a Communications officer on a modern day Aircraft Carrier going all goggly eyed upon hearing the order to leave port? TOS portrayed Starfleet Command as a military style organisation, which makes sense since discipline is required in order to survive such a venture. With each subsequent series, Starfleet increasingly has become this boatload of wide-eyed kids that follow orders only when they choose to and constantly wear their hearts on their sleeves. Also, why does every security chief have a background of being orphaned in a hostile environment? Good grief, get real SF writers handing in scripts and maybe we can get some originality back in this show. However, I'm not holding my breath for that to happen.Unfortunately, the course for Strange New Worlds appears already set. A shame.

But plots stretched too long to rush quasi endings. The show is more about making memes and being slapstick goofy. Musicals, cartoon and parody TOS episodes diluted integrity of the show.

At best, mark out the best eps that make a real season, ditch the restOriginal post based off season 1:\nThis is the first solid entrance to Star Trek since enterprise.Good chemistry, great balance between tribute to how TOS was and mix of new.The plots seem like the original as well without being hijacker's by real life.",

This was best noticeable within the core police team, where both the characters and the team helped each other grow. They all brought something to the team, and they each also got something back in return.The ending was powerful! The plot resolved without stupid Hollywood heroics or shootouts, and the last 5-10 minutes were beautifully done.Can't wait for season 2! Bring it on!!",

In fact, it's one of the more emotionally intelligent crime dramas I've seen in a while.Carl Mørck and Akram Salim are the core of this show, and what makes it sing. Their relationship is neither flashy nor sentimental-it's tense, layered, and quietly magnetic. There's a clear echo of the classic Sherlock-Watson structure, but inverted and humanized. Mørck is a brilliant but emotionally broken detective-not a quirky genius, but a man hollowed out by trauma, leaning into detachment as a survival mechanism. Salim, like Watson, appears at first to be just the grounding presence-but there's more beneath the surface. He gives off a very specific \"ex-military intelligence\" vibe-composed, perceptive, precise. You can feel that he's been trained to watch, not just speak.Even more compelling, though, is how closely their dynamic mirrors Disco Elysium's Du Bois and Kitsuragi. Mørck is the Du Bois figure: emotionally adrift, steeped in failure and regret, piecing himself together through the process of the investigation. Salim, like Kitsuragi, is measured, observant, and unfailingly competent-the quiet counterweight to Mørck's mess. Their relationship is not about dominance, but mutual orbit. Salim isn't just the \"sidekick.\" He's the moral compass, the tether to reality, the one with dignity. And unlike many genre pairings, their mutual respect grows rather than being taken for granted.As for the complaints floating around:\"It's too stylized.\" What does that even mean? The green-tinged grading gives the world a sickly, bureaucratic decay-it's a choice, and it serves the mood. This isn't meant to look \"real.\" It's meant to feel wrong, like something's festering under the surface. Mission accomplished. (Also, what's that about criticizing a show because the color grading doesn't look real, is that a thing now?)\"The office is an old toilet.\" Yes. That's the point. Dept. Q is dumped-literally-into society's waste bin, abandoned and forgotten. It's metaphor, not bad set design.\"Characters are unlikable.\" Not everyone has to be likable. They need to be believable. These people have been scraped raw by loss and guilt. Their walls are up. Watch long enough, and you'll see the cracks-and the humanity.In the end, Dept. Q isn't here to dazzle with twists or cater to nostalgia-it's here to sit with the mess. It's a show about grief, institutional neglect, and two men learning how to function while carrying unbearable weight. It's slow, yes-but deliberately so. The silences speak. The spaces between the action matter. If you're looking for a slick procedural with one-liners and gunfights, look elsewhere. But if you want something moody, character-rich, and quietly devastating, this series doesn't just deserve a watch-it deserves to be felt.",

Nine episodes on one case, it didn't hold my interest and I found myself fast forwarding during parts. The problem as usual is the script. Did the writers get paid by the episode? If so it behooves them to write a lot of episodes. Three cases and 3 episodes for each case and that would have held my interest for 9 hours. Every week crime dramas get solved in a satisfying way in 90 minutes, in movies and on TV. I really didn't need to know about Morck's ex-partner and her son, the writers just ran amuck in every direction.I like quirky Morck, but that's not enough to support a series. The rebel cop who does his own thing and fights with his bosses and co-workers, but solves cases is so cliched. It reminded me of the TV series \"House, MD\", with a similar cliched lead character. These characters only exist in the fantasy world of TV and movies. Morck has some good one liners that will make him popular with the fist bumping bros, they'll eat it up.The first 4-5 episodes moved at glacial speed, we didn't get really into the case until the 5th episode onward. All the research should have been done at the beginning by Morck's team and we would have heard about Merritt's money. The police work wasn't done right and that's on the writers. I found it annoying that they constantly cut back and forth between Morck and Merritt both past and present.I roared with laughter when Morck and Hardy were talking on a mobile phone, while Morck was in the hyperbaric chamber. Mobile service is spotty in rural Scotland anyway and when on a remote Scottish island while in a hyperbaric chamber, LOL. More of the fantasy of movies and TV.I like the cast a lot, kudos to the casting director. Always a fan of Matthew Goode, Kelly Macdonald, Shirley Henderson, Jamie Sives, Mark Bonnar, Kate Dickie, Steven Miller... At least the ending wasn't a bum's rush like many series, we got some resolution at the end. If there's a season 2 and it's another single case for 9 episodes, I'll skip it.",

The production values are polished and cinematic, blending premium K-Drama aesthetics with an American-style spy thriller. However, the action sequences fall flat. Fight choreography is slow and overly cautious, gunfire sounds weak and toy-like, and knife and baton impacts lack any real weight. Environmental destruction is underwhelming, and stunts often feel telegraphed, breaking immersion in high-stakes moments. Additionally, some of the non-Korean actors deliver performances that feel stale or flat, which weakens the overall impact of certain scenes. Had the action been faster, more dynamic, and paired with heavier, impactful sound design - including Korean-style cinematic fight sequences Butterfly could easily have scored 8-10/10. As it stands, it's worth watching for the story and strong performances, but weak action, pacing, and inconsistent acting from non-Korean actors hold it back from reaching its full potential.

Tradecraft is nonexistent-he feels less like an operative and more like a suburban dad caught in cosplay.The action sequences are equally hollow. Where Bourne uses pens, magazines, and taxis with gritty improvisation, Butterfly gives us generic car chases, knife fights with too many flourishes, and Rebecca's constant smirks that drain every ounce of tension. It's all style, no substance-action scenes that look choreographed rather than lived in.Psychologically, the show fumbles again. Jason Bourne was haunted, layered, believable. David and Rebecca? One is inconsistent paranoia, the other a \"smirking teen assassin\" stereotype. The emotional beats play more like daytime soap melodrama with pistols than a gripping espionage story.World-building is paper thin. There's no convincing spy infrastructure, no sense of a global intelligence machine. Just pretty backdrops, some melodrama, and occasional gunfire.

The action scenes are laughably bad.After putting forward such an abysmal series, the showrunners had the hubris to set things up for a second season with a terrible twist at the end.

The first inaccuracy is that the women did not cover up their upper bodies until the missionaries came and made them cover up...but you can't have all the women topless in this series...ha. Many scenes with actors are not filmed in Hawaii, but I guess it's hard to get known Mauna and the backgrounds of scenes without CGI or getting rid of all the current buildings and architecture. You can also tell that many extras and background people are New Zealanders and such. I wished they had used more extras with real Hawaiian bloodlines (the scene where they embarked on O'ahu's beach for battle was obvious). I don't know why they couldn't use more Hawaiian \"locals\" for parts. It was funny to see \"Aquaman\" and his dad, Tom Curry, share leadership scenes together in this series....I was born on Maui, went to high school on Kauai, but unfortunately missed my junior year of Hawaiian history. Hopefully this will be on spot and a good for all to understand da early days of the islands...before England, U. S. and settlers took over, of course. Strap in...I feel this is going to be a good series.Cinemography/editing is decent but typical without creative angles. Music is decent, but it would be awesome if they used more light chants in the background to intensify action or dramatic scenes (Kahiko, Auana, Hapa Haole, etc.).

If everyone is irredeemable, uninteresting and emotionally flatlined, why should we stick around to watch them tear each other apart?If you're going to make a mafia series in 2025, the very least you can do is give the audience characters to care about. Mobland fails spectacularly on this front. Almost every single character seems to be competing in some twisted contest for Most Unbearable Human Being. Watching them is like being trapped at a family dinner where everyone's armed and emotionally unavailable.Let's start with Maeve - mother, grandmother, matriarch from hell. She might just be the most infuriating character on screen since Joffrey Baratheon. At least in Game of Thrones, even the psychopaths were compelling. Here, it's just pure, relentless toxicity.What's baffling is how Mobland seems to have learned absolutely nothing from the greats. In The Sopranos or Peaky Blinders, you witness people doing horrific things - but you care about them. You understand them. There's depth, contradiction, broken humanity. In Mobland, the characters are just... horrible. Not flawed, not morally ambiguous - just flat-out repellent. And not in a fun way.The writing seems to think edge equals interest. But without empathy, there's no tension. Just noise. You're left watching characters commit violent acts without remorse, nuance, or purpose - and following the show becomes painful.There is one bright spot: Tom Hardy. As always, he brings a level of gravitas, unpredictability and wounded charm the rest of the cast can only dream of.

It reveals itself in stages, as each two-dimensional character, in turn, suddenly displays real depth. It's like watching popcorn, wondering when the next kernel is going to blow, always a little surprised by which one it turns out to be.The humor is pervasive, and the writers didn't settle for (only) the obvious \"hey, remember, I'm actually dead\" jokes. The laugh-out-loud moments, for me, were much subtler - like in the news video showing a group of headless bodies as they are encountered by first responders, one of whom slips a pulse-oximeter on a corpse's finger.My wife and I pretty much binged this series in about three sittings.

The division between Wall Street, Native Americans, and a rich land baron who happens to be a rancher is all being played here. The only commonality among the disparate parties is greed. If Costner is trying to be the righteous defender then he's doing it primarily for his own designs as he's painted in the initial episode. That gives him that special JR Ewing sauce. So is it a soap or a statement against squandering natural resources?I see a well-financed new stab at a family soap here. The cinematography is rich using what appears to be Wyoming as a decent stand in for Montana. Certainly there age some good things. I hope the show becomes more real + actually giving insight in how the ruining of what is left of pristine wilderness is playing out That's not as likely as a whole raft of dark back-stabbing will likely be the plan.

Reminiscent of Rock Hudson in \"Giant\", he is trying to hold on to the old ways.\"Yellowstone\" develops quickly with little introduction, yet its story unravels with the natural pace of a wilderness day, pausing for tribal rituals, cowboy conventionalities, and political machinations. It's a far flung undertaking that dwells on the seams between laws and justice, family and friendships.Costner fills his character's boots naturally, it seems. He is a world-wearied man who has seen too much and lied too often. The land and the family are his lifeblood. He can hear the footsteps coming his way, but he can only fulfill his role-out of habit as much as loyalty.Although some action is a little confusing due to lack of explanation, it feels natural, as if the viewer is getting a genuine slice-of-life glimpse into another world. I hope the resolution of this saga includes an emotional payoff that justifies its breadth and its attention to details.Update 7/20/18: After four episodes, this series has a strong voice and a persistent rhythm. We learn the fullness of each story, from roots to fruits. I am increasing my grade to \"9\".",

The problem is we need a rooting interest and mostly we don't like these characters very much, especially the daughter played by Kelly Reilly. She is despicable on every level. The son played by Wes Bentley is weak. The son played by Luke Grimes is the only character who gives us a chance to root. His wife, as played by Kelly Asbille, embodies all the arrogance of wokism and revisionist historians. Cole Hauser's character is a one-note thug. Danny Huston and Gil Birmingham are the bad guys of the piece but they get a real run for their money by the supposed good guys.But more than disagreeable characters, this series desperately needs some humor, some joy, some happiness.

Once I saw that PJ was also in the cast, I got even more excited. I think some folks would be upset to find out that the series is going to be loosely based on the book, but I am glad that it's not. The book wasn't that great- the main action and interesting part wasn't until the last 150 pages. So it's awesome that the series will be broadening and expanding this Rainmaker world. I'm also glad that Bruiser and Sarah are being given a backstory and more involvement into the plot as opposed to the book. Bruiser is barely in the book and Sarah was only mentioned twice in passing. So to see the cast be more diverse and not so male focused is a breath of fresh air.

Ambulance chasing, thin case that might morph into a rainmaking class action suit, a bad domestic situation for our hero, and a serial killer.New series often take 3 or 4 episodes to settle in.

In most cases, these shows are being deservingly dumped in the summer because most of them are terrible. Surprisingly, \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\", which premiered earlier this month, is not terrible. Even though it seemed like it might have been, it ended up being one of the better shows to come along so far in the 2000s. The show is about four friends who own a bar in Philadelphia. At first glance, it doesn't seem like anything special. The owning a bar scenario has been done several times before in a variety of other sitcoms including \"Cheers\" and the recently canceled \"Grounded For Life\". However, since the show is more clever and much funnier than the previous sitcoms who have used the device, one can forgive the lack of originality.What makes \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" better than any other of the sitcoms that are on today is the clever writing. The writing on sitcoms these days is beyond awful. The writing on \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" is great. In fact, if the show doesn't receive an Emmmy nomination for writing, there is no justice in the world. The three episodes that have aired so far have been incredibly well written and unlike with most sitcoms, the dialogue doesn't seem like typical sitcom dialogue. The dialogue comes across as natural as opposed to coming across as forced like on network sitcoms and other cable comedies. The writers are also the stars and executive producers of the show, which gives them almost complete control. Let's hope the writing staff doesn't change.

            "review": "Well TV sociopaths can indeed. In the same fashion as Seinfeld and Arrested development, this show deals with a group of unlikeable misfits while they engage in moronic adventures based in equally moronic impulses. The difference with those spiritual predecessors is that Sunny takes it a step further. As the tagline of the show indicates (\"Seinfeld on a crack) the writers of this show not only embrace the selfishness of their characters but takes it a step further by completely severing their social awareness and empathy towards other human beings. The result, needless to say, is not only sometimes disturbing, but utterly hilarious. Here is a small introduction of each one of the characters:-Dennis Reynolds: A malignant narcissist in its truest form. Dennis believes he is the closest to physical perfection a human can achieve. A reputed ladies man, he is not above using alcohol, lies, emotional abuse and even the implication of danger (if they say no) to get girls in bed with him. He shows great amusement by watching how other people might get hurt by his actions, even if those people are his friends or his sister (who he constantly refers to as a bitch).-Mac: Dennis's best friend and roommate, he equally enjoys to be part of the gang's plans even if that means hurting or offending innocent people. He even benefits from Dennis's system to pick up and seduce girls, because Dennis let's Mac hit on them when he gets bored with them. Mac believes himself a skilled martial artist (Even if he has not taken one lesson in his whole life) and enjoys resolving problems with violence or vandalism.-Charlie: Although equally impulsive and alcoholic as the other's in the gang in many ways, he is the only one who has shown he has some empathy for his fellow human being. He spends his time drinking beer or huffing glue (yes, he huffs glue). Being the most naïve from the group he is easily manipulated by the others, although he has shown he isn't above manipulating them either. He is highly resentful and is prone to violent outbursts.-Deandra \"Sweet Dee\" Reynolds: Dee is as manipulative ad his brother and has been shown as only motivated by her own agenda. She is heavily picked on by the others on the gang because of their misogynistic views. Although as the other characters of the group, specially his brother, she shows no regard for how other people might be getting affected by her actions. She is highly vindictive and she goes to great lengths to make sure her schemes and her lies are being bought by the people involved.-Frank Reynolds: An impulsive, violent and eccentric ex-millionaire he is highly delusional and carries a gun all the time. His likes include prostitutes, drugs and ham (Yes, ham). He is highly irrational and is always looking to crazier and more idiotic ways to deal with the possible issues that might arise for the gang.This show appeals to your inner child in the way that this characters really have the mental development of a child, and you will find hilarious how they will impulsively engage in idiotic plans without showing any preoccupation of how the consequences could be for them, their friends or for the people unfortunate enough to get involved with them. Is a refreshing show because it is one of the first comedies that embraces the darkness of its characters and the comedic possibilities of having a group of alcoholic, impulsive, borderline criminal, but dim witted protagonists. These are highly unlikeable people, and their humor might offend you in one way or another, but mark my words: You will enjoy every minute of it.",

I don't know anyone who's seen this show who hasn't loved it. This is one of those shows where you'll have to watch each episode more than once because you'll miss parts from laughing so much. I've seen every episode of every season a few times and it's just as funny rewatching it as it was the first time. The cast (Charlie Day, Rob McElhenney, Glenn Howerton, Kaitlin Olson and Danny DeVito) is perfect. They are all hilarious, as are all the supporting characters. I can't recommend this show enough, do yourself a favor and go watch it as soon as you can. I promise that you won't be disappointed.",

The way they have the real life situations and the true reactions within a set of friends sets this show apart (Seinfeld anyone?)...there's no following the lives of multi-millionaire brats as lead characters (fill in the blank for that show, there's only about 5 on air right now), none of the worn out \"the city is going to blow up unless you catch the bad guy in 5 minutes\" plot lines...it's real situations and almost everyone can relate...and laugh at.",

            "review": "There hasn't been a show in the world that makes me laugh as hard or as often than It's Always Sunny in its prime. Seasons 1 through 5 have some of the best, sharpest comedy writing in ages. Since then, the show hasn't been as consistently brilliant, but there are gems in every season. The premise is very simple. It's about the life of four Philly bar owners. At least until season 2 brings in the father of siblings Dennis and Dee, Frank Reynolds, played to perfection by Danny DeVito, where it becomes a fearless fivesome of hilarity. The thing is, these aren't your ordinary people. They're delusional, narcissistic, borderline-psychotic idiots. The show has been described as \"Seinfeld on crack\" and that's about as good a descriptor you can get. The gang are always coming up with ridiculous schemes and stupid ideas which consistently result in awkwardness and belly laughs.One of the best parts of the show is the characters themselves. They come across as shallow douchebags most of the time, because for the most part, they are, but they each have their own distinct personality that mesh so well with the others. Dennis Reynolds is about as close to an everyman that you can get from the gang, and he's a manipulative, insecure, raving sociopath. His sister Dee is almost as depraved but with more self-loathing and less psychopathy. Their father Frank is a rich businessman who traded that life away for living in the slums as a lascivious alcoholic. Specifically, he shares a bed with Charlie, the illiterate, idiot savant wild card of the group. Dennis' roommate Mac is an oblivious closeted homosexual that favors badassery above all else. To put it lightly, they get themselves into some interesting scenarios. Whether they're all together or broken into various group combinations, you can guarantee laughs are to be had.The chemistry between the actors really sells the whole thing. Rob McElhenney, Glenn Howerton, and Charlie Day are geniuses. Their writing, their acting, it's all so natural and infectious that you can't help but get immersed into any zany idea they come up with just to see how the gang comes out the other side. Kaitlin Olson and Danny DeVito are just as much necessary pieces to the cast. The humor ranges from uncomfortable to terribly politically incorrect, and that's the beauty of the show. It takes these \"delicate\" topics and shines a light on them that many people are afraid to address. The first season alone deals with racism, abortion, transsexuals, and child molestation. And no matter the topic, they find a way to make it hard-to-breathe hysterical.I can boast about this show for days, but the fact is you either enjoy the humor or you don't. There's a lot of yelling and plenty of curse words, and it may be grating for newcomers to dip their toes into something like this, especially if they don't know what they're getting into. But for those who do and appreciate clever unrestrained comedy, treat yourself to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.Great intro episodes: (#3.9) Sweet Dee Is Dating a Retarded Person - (#2.4) Mac Bangs Dennis' Mom - (#2.3) Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare - (#4.10) Sweet Dee Has a Heart Attack - (#4.12) The Gang Gets Extreme: Home Make Over Edition - (#6.3) The Gang Buys a Boat",

            "review": "This show sucks for so many reasons which most people have explored on this forum from Charlie Day's annoying screaming and overacting to Rob McElhenney's wooden performance at best. What this show lacks is the straight man. These are all deranged, despicable individuals. The closest would have to be Glenn Howerton's character, who is an insecure, self-absorbed, conceited narcissist. There is no comedic balance between the characters, and the jokes are ribald, cheap shots at minorities and the disabled without any good timing.This show is compared to Seinfeld, which is beyond me. Despite their flaws, all the protagonists on Seinfeld are somewhat charming. Elaine's wit, George's cunning, Jerry's sarcasm and Kramer's philosophical rants is what makes these characters so appealing. Mac, Sweet Dee, Dennis and Charlie are just unpleasant morons that lack any real savvy or intelligence in anything other than conning other people with their hair-brained schemes. There is not much difference in any of their persona, which makes it unbelievable, stale and awkward to watch.Empathy is a key ingredient in any comedy, and I cannot relate to any of these characters at all. It's unsettling to watch an idiot like Charlie scream (with such bad overacting on Day's part) when he doesn't have his way or when he wants to get his point across, much like a petulant child throwing a tantrum. Neither is funny and frankly, it gets on my nerves!",

If you make a show with him in it and still make it almost the worst sitcom on television, then you're doing something wrong. The script of this show is just so bad.But the script is not the worst thing about this show, that's the acting.Danny DeVito is good for a few laughs, but the rest of the cast isn't.->Let's start with Charly Day, the most overrated actor of the century. The only thing that guy does is get on my nerves with his overacting and hyperactive behavior. I don't understand how anyone can think that guy is funny. It's like being in the loudest part of a psychiatric hospital and i don't consider being there as funny.->Then you have Glenn Howerton and Kaitlin Olson. They are both equally bad. They're also quite invisible in this show, so there's not too much to say about them.->And then you have the 'mastermind' of this show Rob McElhenney. I have to say, maybe in another show and just as an actor maybe he can be funny ,but in this bad written show (by himself) he's just not good.I first watched 5 seasons of this show because I thought it would be as good as IMDb-reviewers made it out to be, but I was so disappointed that I almost want to cry. Every episode I hoped it would maybe grow and be better, but almost every episode was a big letdown. So don't let all these good reviews misguide you, it'll probably disappoint you as well.",

Danny Devito does just enough to anchor the cast but still allows the younger and lesser known co-stars to develop their characters around him. Often times, a more established actor with Devito's credentials will wash out the co-stars and smother the show. This is not the case with Sunny. Put simply, this show works. It may take another solid season for this show to cultivate a substantial core audience. But it seems FX is willing to stick with it long enough to find out. Even if FX decides to run this show up against the big boys (CBS' \"Without a Trace\") in the fall, Thursdays at 10pm is a perfect time slot. Sunny is gritty and dark at times, but in a harmless and smart kind of way. Kudos, FX...This show is a winner!",

I went into Countdown hoping for a tense, fast-paced thriller, but what I got was a painfully predictable mess riddled with bad acting and even worse writing. The premise had potential - a ticking clock scenario with high stakes - but everything from the characters to the dialogue felt like a lazy first draft.The cast seems completely disengaged, delivering lines with all the energy of a table read. Emotional scenes fall flat, action sequences lack urgency, and even basic conversations feel forced and unnatural. It's hard to care about characters when the actors themselves look like they don't.The writing is the show's weakest point. Clichés are piled on top of clichés, with no originality or nuance. Every twist is telegraphed from a mile away, and the attempts at \"clever\" dialogue are cringeworthy at best. It tries to be edgy and intelligent, but ends up feeling like a cheap imitation of better thrillers.Overall, Countdown is a frustrating waste of time.

He's the best thing about this series as he carries it. Theresa only negative is we have to wait a week between episodes, I hate that and much prefer to binge watch the season in a few days.

Riveting.Jensen Ackles tries his best. You can almost see the effort dripping off his furrowed brow. But it's hard to deliver a compelling performance when the script gives you dialogue that sounds like it was stitched together from rejected NCIS episodes. He broods, he stares into the distance, and you just know the director yelled \"Look tortured!\" one too many times.The plot? Something about conspiracies, government agencies, a mysterious past, and a countdown to... who knows. Probably the end of your patience. Every episode promises high stakes but delivers something more like a flat energy drink: bitter, forgettable, and full of artificial tension.The action scenes are a blurry mess of shaky camera work and shadowy lighting, probably so we can't tell what's going on - or who's still awake. As for the pacing, it's called Countdown but it moves like someone trying to set an alarm clock with oven mitts on.If this show were a bomb, I'd be rooting for it to go off.

Now I know that people are allowed to have opinions and everyone has different opinions but I'm not kidding when I say this is exactly the same as like 50 other cop shows, all the reviews that were praising this series only praise Jensen Ackles and they're all pretty much saying the same thing, in no means is Jensen a bad actor but he literally has no range he pretty much plays the same character in everything I've seen him in (this, supernatural, the boys, batman animated film series, my bloody Valentine, ten inch hero, days of our lives) in literally all of those he plays a sassy guy who's pretty much the straight white male stereotype but even from interviews that's who Jensen actually seems to be as a person.

As Agent Mark Devlin, he brings a layered, emotionally grounded performance that feels both raw and real.

Each episode peels back another layer of the mystery while adding depth to the characters. The supporting cast holds their own, but it's clear that Ackles is the engine driving the story forward.Visually, the series leans into its gritty aesthetic-dark alleys, tense silences, and moments of explosive action all help set the tone. Combined with a pulsing score and slick direction, the vibe is somewhere between True Detective and 24, with a fresh edge.If the rest of the season keeps up this energy, Countdown is set to be a standout in the thriller genre.

Rather than showcasing characters who are smart, insightful, determined, and intriguing, the series prioritizes violence and internal squabbling, ultimately detracting from any potential for meaningful character and plot development.The show appears to sacrifice genuine storytelling for gratuitous action, leaving the impression that the writers gave up on crafting compelling narratives. Instead of allowing viewers to connect with characters through their investigative prowess or their personal journeys, Countdown leans heavily on predictable conflicts and a relentless barrage of violent scenes. This over-reliance on surface-level thrills leaves a void where genuine tension and intellectual engagement should be.For those yearning for a police drama that truly delves into the intricacies of crime-solving, Countdown misses the mark. Imagine a series where an entire season is dedicated to meticulously investigating a single crime, allowing for a deep exploration of the evidence, the false leads, the breakthroughs, and the sheer determination required to bring a case to justice. Such a show would highlight the intellectual rigor and emotional toll of police work, rather than resorting to superficial theatrics.Ultimately, Countdown is a missed opportunity.

It's a bit like a mockumentary.I really liked Lip in Shameless, so I'm happy to see him back in a good show. And yes, I can see It's a well made show, production wise, in acting and in art-production. It really sets the vibe well.But somehow I just have a hard time to get into this story or characters. It's all brought overly nervous and a bit hyper, especially the first few episodes. I'm somewhat conflicted on how the people respond to Carmy's presence. Sure, there's some bad blood with his cousin and It needs time to adapt to his different perspective of running a kitchen, I got that. But at the same time he's like one of the best chefs of the world and there's no respect for him at all. That takes away from the dynamic of hating the change, but respecting the man, which makes It feel a bit one-dimensional to me. It's all very focused on the conflicts and overly dramatised which doesn't rhyme with the \"realistic\" approach.Also, nothing really interesting happens. It's mostly just a thing that breaks in the kitchen. A hole in the wall, a machine that broke, toilet that leaked etc etc It's not very interesting writing. It's all about the packaging that tries to make It original.It's sort of entertaining, but I wouldn't call this a comedy. And that's fine, but I just wonder what part of It is supposed to be funny.I guess It's just a group of people I have a hard time to relate to, The way they do and talk, what they say, It's all a bit whatever. Which is key for a show that's mostly about the characters. Storytelling is all over the place, so you just pick the information randomly along the way.I want to like It, but I don't really so far.",

I finished this entire show in one day, and I regret nothing. This series draws you in with an opening reminiscent of the movie \"Waiting,\" and after introducing heavy topics like suicide, addiction, alcoholism, familial stressors, battles with coworkers, trauma, and an overall feeling of existential dread, the series ends, and you just sit there and say, \"Wow.\" I am SO happy I found this show.

I've miserably pushed through the first season, and really wish I wouldn't have wasted my time. This show manages to simultaneously give the vibe that it was written by someone who grew up watching scripted bad reality tv shows about manufactured kitchen nightmares and has no idea what it's really like to run a restaurant like this, while it depicts everything wrong about restaurant work that CAN be changed and fixed. I could write a novel about the absurdly bad writing (the table-less bar-style 80s plastic menu board greasy spoon takeout restaurant that sells italian beef sandwiches \"doesn't do to-gos\" and instead employs a full staff to sit around and make small batches of time-consuming fine french fusion dishes with no wait staff), but frankly it's too annoying to think about. The first two episodes include no plot development or character storylines and is simply filled with people screaming over each other the entire time. I cannot understand what anyone says. The extras angrily scream \"CORNER\" at the top of their lungs every 1.5 seconds -anyone who says \"this is how restaurants work\" has only worked in highly dysfunctional abusive environments and are conditioned to accept the abuse. This is manufactured stress and drama for the show, and it comes off as lazy writing and obnoxious. Why is the container of gravy on top of a box on the top shelf in an otherwise empty walk in? Because they need DRAMA but don't really want to spend any time making sure the scene seems realistic in any way! This show feels like it was written by a kitchen nightmares reality show producer, and has the same lazy writing, lazy producing, \"producers hate their talent\" type-vibe of those shows. The chicago references are terrible and stereotypical of what people who aren't from chicago think everyone thinks/talks/acts like there. The only good thing this show offers is beautiful shots of food. That's mostly what the show is. Close-ups of food cooking. We almost never see any of the characters outside of the restaurant. We don't know their lives. They don't have relationships or kids. They're stressed out drones that are there to \"serve.\" A very elitist view of restaurant workers. We hardly know the characters names, as every 3rd word coming out of their mouths are \"chef.\" Everyone in the show calls everyone else \"chef.\" I don't know where this fascist military-like de-personalization of restaurant staff originated from, but it's demeaning. Restaurant owners/managers/workers who wish to alienate their staff and make sure their business fails should employ this \"calling everyone \"chef\" technique. We all know that what people like the most is being de-personalized and being called by words and names that aren't who and what they are. Big props to the actors in the show, they are the only part that makes it worth watching. I would have quit after episode 1 if it weren't for them.",

ER's are places of extreme excitement, sadness and humor (the rat scene alone beat many comedies made today). It's fun to be a couple episodes into a medical show and looking forward to more instead of rolling my eyes and moving on.Being Hollywood we get the usual moralizing, but most shows lecture while delivering inane dialogue with one dimensional characters. Give me a solid story in a realistic setting with great characters and I can sit through a fair share of finger-wagging.

I thought, wow, a show about the ER that subtly focuses on how the HCPs, patients, and cases reflect the world around them without beating us over the head with a certain point of view - all while capturing the chaos of emergency medicine with a high degree of medical accuracy!Well, the subtle part did not last. I feel like I am a good person to make this point, because not only have I worked in this setting, but also, I agree with many of the social points they're making on a practical level. I just hate when I feel like a show is preaching at me at the expense of narrative & immersion. It's fine for a show to have a point of view, and medical cases are a good vehicle for this, but it starts to feel like instead of exploring interesting characters, this becomes a tertiary focus, and many of the patients and some of the HCPs just become avatars to preach about some social issue. This would still be ok if it was just shown in an interesting way, but the writers have a tendency to preach and write these things unnecessarily into the dialogue, or go too cliche/unrealistic with the scenario.These don't really become a big issue until the middle/late episodes (before things pop off, but no spoilers here) so it can feel a little bait and switchy.There's just WAY too much telling over showing with any social issue, too. One example that comes to mind is an obese patient who was misdiagnosed due to assumptions about her metabolic health, because of her obesity. There's nothing wrong with showing this, in fact it's cool to show how complex diagnosing in this environment is, but after we are shown this and can deduce for ourselves what happened and why it was a problem, we get a doc lecturing another about why they're bad for for doing and why you shouldn't judge an obese person by their obesity. Or the trans woman who comes in and gets called by the wrong name from their insurance, and the doctors treat her with respect in the room. A bit unnecessary story wise but that alone made sense and showed us more about who those characters are, which is great. But then we get one of the doctors stopping her on her way out the room talking about I'm sorry your name was misgendered we need to do better etc etc. There's no need for these afterschool movie moments - just let the scenes speak for themselves!That brings me to my last point. Some of the acting is bad, and some of the characters are quite grating as a result of this plus some thin writing. On its own it's not a big deal, but with the issues I mentioned above, you need skilled actors to pull some of this off. Dr Robby, Dr Heather Collins, Whittaker, Dr Mel King, the head nurse, they're all fantastic. But for every one of those we have a Santos, Mohan, Javadhi, many of the patients, even Langdon at times, who make this feel like a high school play. These are also some of the more obnoxious characters where it's especially important to have charismatic actors playing them. I mean \"SloMo\" Mohan specifically, you need a certain kind of person with a magnetism to pull off the \"I'm more empathetic than you all\" and \"I know I'm great\" schtick without it being grating and obnoxious.Anyway, this show is still worthy of watching, but I do hope they address some of these issues for S2 if it returns.",

The \"love its\" praised it for what I praised it for (above). The \"hate its\" did not like that you don't have a joke, then a laugh, then a joke, then a laugh. This is an adult satire. When you reviewers write that you can't find anything to like about the characters, THAT'S the idea. You are supposed to delve into why you don't like them. You are supposed to not like what they do (or, if you're a little bit twisted, LOVE what they do). Brilliantly written by Mike White, it exposes the underbelly of people, yet still shows dignified people in the same context. You don't like water breaking? That is a natural occurrence. White mingles humanity with absurdity, and coats it with a sheen of money, power, and humility. These actors are willing to be bad people, honest people, people at the end of their rope, and people trying to understand what life holds for them.

But it's done in a rather ham-fisted way, with characters who incomprehensibly lack almost any social skills, or act cluelessly in what are otherwise pretty normal situations.

I keep hoping for some original plot development or even shocking twists but they never come. Besides the pretty art work and costumes to look at, the talented actors do keep me glued, especially the two sisters played by Cynthia Nixon and Christine Baranski. You have to love Baranski's cool snide delivery of those memorable one-liners. Cynthia Nixon is a revelation here as Aunt Ada. I have always found her to be rather annoying in her other work, but here she is my favorite, and I look forward to every scene that she is in. The other actors, from Carrie Coon as Bertha Russell to Blake Ritson as Oscar, deliver capably as expected. However, it needs to be called out that the main protagonist, the so-called glue to all characters and all storylines, is played by an actress who is clearly out of her league. The burden of carrying the show falls on her shoulders, and her inexperience and shortcomings are in full view. Louisa Jacobson exudes zero charm as Marion Brook. She fails to make this central character sympathetic which is critical to the quality of this show. For the first few episodes I start to question why she is selected as the main actress as I am perplexed. Then I find out that she is the daughter of none-other-than the great Meryl Streep, possibly the best actress of all time. There must be an assumption that due to genetic association, Louisa has to be just as good. But here is living proof that sometimes the apple can indeed fall far from the tree.",

Aside of minor mistakes, façades not being the right stone, streets missing small details, the show presents the age rightly, especially one that was written a lot about, and mostly from a women's feud views. The men offer the backside of this, they didn't care about their wives' issues, they make business in between each other and let them manage the social side of their lives.The show is heavily inspired from Alva Vanderbilt's takedown on Old New York, her bid on becoming socially acceptable agains Mrs Astor's 400, the Knickerbockers. Old ways vs the new way, Americans, especially Newyorkers, finding their footing in the new order where the US was beginning to be a power in its own right, and so, then, of course, the Buccaners, the most famous 3: Minnie Stevens, Jennie Jerome, and Consuelo Vanderbilt, the first 2 ones ran away from NY due to the lack of acceptance their families had, Alva was of a sterner material, first she won at home, and then she placed Consuelo as a duchess in England. Shortly after she divorced her husband, marry the love of her life, and then became an activism for women rights, vote, etc. What a woman, ha!I also disagree with those who refer to this as woke, luckily is not, Fellowes loves to introduce these \"downstairs\" stories, and it is going to be one of the lines to go, so I like that, he is also usually thorough when it comes to details, I mean, don't expect seeing Peggy marrying a Vanderbilt or an Astor, he does not play with history on that regard but there will some surprise there for sure.I hope this one follows its course, it could run for 4 season easily, and more.",

I think the visual production values are very good.The casting/direction/writing for the aristocrats is all wrong with the exception of Ms. Baranski and Ms. Nixon. Why are the old aristocrats written to be so much real and human than the social upstarts, the Russel family? The gay live-in relationship of the Van Rijn/Adams partners is quite unlikely in that period.The portrayal of Stanford White as a wimpy, middles-aged sycophant in his behavior toward the upstart Russells is also bad writing. White was a dashing rake (in his 20s-30s in the 1880s), noted for his ego and bravado. This illustrates the problem of throwing in real historic characters without doing proper research.Perhaps this production shows the growing disrespect for our real history, lived by real people?

            "review": "So here it is at last: one of the most highly anticipated new TV-shows of the year, the spin-off from probably THE most highly praised TV-show in the history of Television. Naturally, expectations were over the roof - and it was a forgone conclusion that meeting those expectations would be next to impossible. Well, here's the good news. Judging from the first couple of episodes, 'Better Call Saul' will be good. Just how good remains to be seen, but as far as promises go, those first episodes made a big one.For those who haven't seen it yet: relax - I won't spoil a thing about the storyline. Instead, I'll concentrate on all other aspects of the show. The first thing you notice (as was the case with Breaking Bad) is the camera. The photography is simply gorgeous. All the visual trademarks I've grown to love so much in BB are there: the playful camera angles; the creative ways to establish even a simple scene with unusual, interesting shots (yet without ever distracting from the storytelling) - it's just beautiful to look at.Then there's the music. From the wonderful introductions (before the opening credits) to the last scene of an episode, music is not just used as background \"noise\": carefully picked songs are there to give clues and are as much an integral part of the story as they help establish the tone of certain scenes. And the original music by Dave Porter feels as organic to 'Better Call Saul' as it did in 'Breaking Bad'.The writing, directing and acting (so far) are on par with BB; anyone afraid this would be a rushed production trying to surf on BB's success can relax; not for a second did I get the feeling this was somehow not well thought through or cheaply constructed by a committee of writers - and although we do of course get some of our favorite characters back, new ones are introduced that promise to be just as original and interesting as the ones that helped turn BB into a cultural phenomenon. And adding high calibre actors such as Michael McKean ('This Is Spinal Tap') to the cast is probably an indication that Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould will not content themselves - or us - by mainly exploring the characters we already know.And then, finally, there's the magnificent Bob Odenkirk. Starting off as a slightly one-dimensional character and comic relief in BB, the character we've come to love as the sleazy, slick Saul Goodman has already shown more layers in the first half of the first season of 'Better Call Saul' than over his entire run on BB. And that's as much thanks to Odenkirk as the fantastic writing: the actor obviously relished the opportunity to show what he's capable of as his character charms, squirms and threatens his way through his scenes, but - somewhat unexpectedly - he also manages to move you during the more quiet moments.To sum up my overall impressions: 'Better Call Saul' is a darkly comic, multilayered story that could end up being just as unusual and exciting as we all dared to hope. The tone may be consistent with 'Breaking Bad', but make no mistake: this is very much its own thing. The writing, directing and acting - as well as the production values - are top notch, and if what we've seen so far is anything to go by, we're in for a great first season of a very promising new show.

            "review": "Let's face facts: Spin-off TV shows tend to fare poorly to the original content. I was furious when I heard about the spin-off to the amazing Break Bad. Nonetheless centering around the buffoonish clown of a character Saul Goodman?! I was livid and heartbroken. I wanted Breaking bad to end on a high note and not let this potential disaster ruin it's legacy.Breaking Bad was an absolute masterpiece of a show, with an amazing story, script, cinematography; you name it, it's there. But the one thing that made Breaking Bad shine, and in my option, be one of the greatest series ever made was it's deep, deep burial into the characters that made us either absolutely love or loath them. It didn't rely on special effects and had no fat to it whatsoever. No other show encapsulated a slow unfurling of characters so well that it was as if we were getting to know them in our real lives.I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot after hating it's first episode on release. I figured, maybe I could eventually forget about the fact that it was attached to my favorite TV show, and when everybody who watches it is telling you it's amazing, there must be something there.. right?Boy, were they right. Better Call Saul is just as good as it's predecessor. It maintains it's very high standard to every aspect of the production, and most of all, character development, motivation and relationships are centerfold once more. It is easy to find Better Call Saul even better than Breaking Bad, although I would chalk this up to it being more current and therefore more in the forefront of our minds in the Breaking Bad universe. If you, like me, have hesitated to give this show a shot for the same reasons, stop it. Let yourself feel uncomfortable for the 1st half of the first season, and then let it get it's clutches into you.I'm so, so very happy I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot again 4 years later.

Most of the convenient circumstances in this show are less plausible than one of those silly comic book movies of grown men in spandex fighting 70's Star Trek aliens. Hey egomaniacs making this swill, get the hell on with the plot and stop pussyfooting around in love with your cinematography and witty Easter eggs all on the shoulders of a much more superior show.

But unlike other TV spin-off's that are just 'extra' episodes that degrade the original show, Better Call Saul has significant promise as a standalone series that could come to rival it's predecessor.From the very beginning, the show returned me to the universe of Breaking Bad. Not in the obvious ways of reviving characters and settings, but through the subtle cinematography and script writing of Vince Gilligan. The camera focus changes and the interesting angled shots are quite unique to Gilligan's shows. This artistic and cinematic experience that begun with Breaking Bad is now continuing with Better Call Saul, once again proving that television can be as good, if not better than films.The acting in the series is incredible. I don't think anyone will be able to top Cranston's portrayal of Walter White, but Odenkirk forms far more depth in the character of Saul Goodman than we ever see in Breaking Bad. Moving away from just comic relief, Saul is now a darker version of his false identity, and Odenkirk finds the balance between these two personas very well. Hopefully he will continue this standard to give Jimmy McGill a Walter White-like descent into the criminal world.The humor in Better Call Saul is really well done. The show isn't a comedy, but the occasional funny moments are quite akin to what was done in Breaking Bad. The dark, witty wordplay made me laugh quite a few times at Saul's... sorry, Jimmy's lines, with the subtlety of the script writing shining through.The music by Dave Porter once again really adds to the engrossing cinematic experience of the show. The musical choices are reminiscent of Breaking Bad, but are moulded in a very different way to form a lighter tone in some of the more comical moments. The weird and wonderful musical montage songs are back (starting in the first scene), which brings us back to Walt and Jesse's cooking (Crystal Blue Persuasion, anyone?).Gilligan and Gould start the story with quite a lot of missing context surrounding Jimmy's brother Chuck and his law firm. Although this may be confusing in the beginning, I later realized this was intentional. Instead of just spitting out the back story in unnatural ways, the writers make you think about the situations, and gradually piece together what happened before the events of the show. This widens the whole show's time-frame, instead of just being self-contained. The brief flash forward to the fragmented Saul Goodman after Breaking Bad was amazing. I really hope that the writers continue to play around with time, shifting between past and future guises of Saul Goodman.Better Call Saul has a lot of promise to extend itself beyond its Breaking Bad spin-off status. The show feels individual, but also leaves enough Breaking Bad in there to keep us from leaving the world of Albuquerque that we have grown to love.",

He engages in all manner of shady activity, while other characters from the previous show have their own things to deal with. As with the previous show, it's a serial, with episodes ending in cliffhangers. And make no mistake, you'll want to keep watching.Basically, it's the type of series that you have to see to believe.

Otherwise there is very little of Breaking Bad here - almost nothing of the story, the pace, the quality or even the Saul Goodman humor.*Breaking Bad Spoiler warning* Think of this. By episode 1 in Breaking Bad, Walt is already a cook, they're already dealing, have the RV and have killed someone and have another hostage. Walt has cancer, revealed it to the family, met Tuco, the Tuco attack on Jesse, Tuco kidnapping of the two, Hank killing Tuco, and Walt explaining his fugue state to the family and I still skipped a lot of events.I am currently 11 episodes into BCS and the whole first season could be fit into 2 or 3 episodes. It is short on events and long with takes.There is a scene where the camera zooms in to show graffiti and it takes about 30 seconds to show \"(I) was here\" when it could've done it in 10. There are a lot of mood setting and establishing shots that are made into scenes. A Cinnabon branch's closing routine is shown in full, including locking up the bottled water/juice, taking out the trash, the walk across the closed mall, etc.The events are non-events - James playing with a light-switch is not interesting in any way.The story doesn't seem to be heading in any direction. The episodes end without suspense, cliffhangers or even the slightest curiosity - you simply never feel like you need to watch the next one.I feel as if all this material could've been great as a side dish for a real story. Instead it's a lot of filler but no real meat.Breaking Bad was great because it had a great story to tell, great characters, quotes, music, drama and comedy. This one has none of those things. No great dialogues or quotes, forgettable soundtrack, no humor like Breaking Bad (Jesse, Saul, so many jokes), the drama is very little, and the characters, well, other than James and slightly Mike, there isn't much to write home about.It's simply not an enjoyable show and it does not look like it'll get better.",

Am a huge fan of 'Breaking Bad', so was really psyched in seeing its prequel 'Better Call Saul' too. My opinion of Bob Odenkirk is also very high, so there was absolutely no way this was going to be missed. Have binged on many shows in the past seven years or so and was determined for this to be one of them, very like 'Breaking Bad'.'Better Call Saul' was every bit as amazing as reputed. Have seen many shows that started off wonderfully but declined badly in their final seasons, a few with really bad last episodes ('House of Cards', 'Game of Thrones', 'Killing Eve'), but then there are rarities like 'Breaking Bad' where every season was at least positively received and on the most part universally acclaimed. 'Better Call Saul' is another one of the rarities and is the first show seen in a long time to not have a bad episode in it, since 'Breaking Bad'. Seriously compelling and addictive stuff and exceptional in every area.Visually, 'Better Call Saul' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.The writing for 'Better Call Saul' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, although quite talky, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The pull no punches and gritty approach to the subject was often chilling and harrowing to watch. The direction couldn't be better.Likewise with the acting, with Odenkirk on absolutely towering form throughout as one of television's most fascinating and meatiest leading characters, one that one is repulsed by but also one that is not hard to sympathise with in some situations. Rhea Seehorn and Michael McKean are excellent as well, McKean giving one of his best work in years. The character writing is rich and compellingly real.Concluding, truly outstanding show. 10/10.",

It's been a little over a year since the finale aired and I'm still mesmerized about how this crew lead by Peter Gould & Vince Gilligan pulled it off, again.When Breaking Bad reached its finale, it was hard for me to imagine any other show being able to reach it's level, let alone arguably surpass it. And when I heard that there was a spin-off regarding Saul Goodman, I thought maybe the show could have some solid and funny moments, and maybe bring a bit of depth towards some beloved Breaking Bad characters.Spin-offs in television are usually seen to me as fan service, or a way to make more money off of a franchise that was loved. That doesn't mean that all of them are bad, but most of them don't have the passion or care that'd make you think it was extremely necessary to make a spin-off, especially considering the risk of making previous characters look bad writing wise. And while Better Call Saul was AMC's idea to make more money off of the franchise, I'm shocked with how the creators and writers were able to make another masterpiece.This show was always meant to be in the shadow of Breaking Bad in my eyes, and I never would've thought of these shows as something that'd be deserving to talk about in the same breath as one another. But Better Call Saul took the ball that Breaking Bad was rolling, picked it up, and launched it forward.While I think Breaking Bad has peaks that no other show can reach, Better Call Saul was able to do things that it's predecessor never could. The depth and writing of these characters are honestly perfect. So much so that I'd consider the shows leads Jimmy and Kim to be two of the best written characters in television history. And while the cast of this show is extremely stacked, Chuck McGill to me is a character that's honestly overlooked compared to the rest. His character has a pretty clear consensus amongst most people, but there's so much to him and Jimmy's dynamic that's it's honestly not as black and white as most people make it out to be, despite both being objectively wrong in certain aspects of the series. It's really fascinating to me.The main aspect of the show that baffles me is how perfectly timed the arcs are considering this is a prequel. Every event in the show is written so well and is paced in a brilliant way to the point where no character arc seems to be rushed, yet the show still remains interesting. You think you've reached the pinnacle of a characters journey, then a curveball is thrown that changes everything.That's not even mentioning how balanced both the lawyer side and the cartel side of the show are. When I first started the show I was eager to get more of the Mike and cartel portion, but the lawyer side of the story honestly paved the way for the first half of this show and was the most compelling part of the first 3 seasons.My word of advice to anyone who watches this show.1. Be patient\n2. Understand that this is not Breaking Bad.At some point the show will get very intense, but enjoy what arcs you are given at the time because before you know it, you'll look back and realize you were in the good times of the show. If you watch Better Call Saul after watching Breaking Bad, you might ask for one thing early on. But when you actually get it, you'll realize that the destination wasn't the key, but it was the journey to get there.Considering most of the characters in this show were never even supposed to exist, it's safe to call Better Call Saul a miracle in television. Whether that was because of an actor wanting to be written off, an actor having a busy filming schedule, or a throw away line that created two of the greatest characters in the entire universe, it's amazing that Breaking Bad was able to pave the way for one of the greatest shows of all time. But what's even more impressive is Better Call Saul makes it to where Breaking Bad is not even complete without its existence.Kudos to Peter Gould, Vince Gilligan and the entire crew that returned to create Better Call Saul, and I'm grateful I got to experience this universe come to a close.",

There are still parts where is drags, but in general things are finally starting to happen. Still, almost finished with the 4th season and there is still not much going on.And then we get to S04E07 and everything starts to grind to a halt again A six minute intro that tell us nothing. There's another music video of dudes making a meth lab. They are copying some of the iconic music videos in Breaking Bad where thing actually happened.I was just about to bump this up to 6 or 7 stars, but I think that I'll wait.This could have been an excellent series. Instead it is like a house guest who doesn't know when it's time to go home. Three seasons in and the material could have been covered in six episodes. They are just dragging this thing out forever. Just because you have a TV series with ten episodes of 44 minutes (or whatever it is) doesn't mean you can just show someone walking for a minute. Tell a story. Tell stories. Literally, every scene is too long. How could someone write this? Stop wasting our time.If you examine this series you would have to agree that they drag almost every scene along to absurd lengths. Do they realize that you don't actually have to show someone on camera walking across a street, for example? You can just show the person taking a step in that direction and then cut. In the next cut you can show them on the other side. Basic film making.This is a problem with many series and feature films. They have no idea of how much time they need to tell their particular story. I can't count how many feature films I have seen recently that go well beyond the standard 90 minutes, and for no real reason. Netflix cranks out lots of bad movies that go two hours that could be trimmed to 45 minutes, easily. This show is one of the worst (best?) examples of feet dragging. It's excruciating to watch.Just watch the first scene in the first episode of Season 4. It clocks in at a bit over eight minutes. It tells us very, very little. Eight minutes is an eternity. Most comedy series clock in at 22 minutes for an entire episode so thus scene would have been more than a third of a show. This is only one example and I could list dozens and dozens of this same wasting of time.I wish that I knew exactly how much screen time was spent agonizing over Hector Salamanca's heart pills. Jesus, talk about extreme over-kill.",

Supernatural is somewhat endearing in that the main characters (the only ones who will be recurring) are brothers, however, the writing makes the characters more believable. They are different from each other, each with their own take on life and things that are not typical. I think as the show goes on it will continue to get better,though it is great now. I can't wait to see more of this show!Another plus is the little bits of humor placed here and there, which, when done right, is always a plus. Some of the best shows/movies are ones in which one minute you are sitting on the edge of your seat biting your nails and the next you are laughing at some irony or funny statement/joke a character has said. Also, having two very attractive men in the cast doesn't hurt, either ;)",

Most shows you tune into after the first few minutes your lost and you lose interest, unlike Supernatural.

The  story isn't exactly complex, but the storytelling technique pulls you  in and holds your attention, making you want to know more about the  supernatural beings and the rules that govern their shadow world. I'm  usually not a fan of darkness and horror, but this show is effective.  It's dark urban fantasy and it has the potential to go a long way.

He had a background of Kansas, which is ironic because he was in Kansas in another hit WB show Smallville. He played the older brother who kind of taking care of his younger brother played by Jared Padalecki. Jared's character was tired of hunting supernatural things. but when his own girlfriend dies the same way his mom died, he decided to hunt that thing. This all happened in the pilot episode. Both brothers are also looking for their father who hasn't returned to them in days. He was on his hunting trip( looking for the thing that killed his wife). This also happened in the pilot episode.

Two monster hunting brothers travel cross country and extinguish a different monster each week. Not too much on the original side, I know. However, I can't help but watch this show every week with a fondness for my old junior high days. For those who don't know I was a huge sci-if/horror geek in my younger years and I loved reading about \"The Crazy Hook Man who kills Teenagers\" or \"The Ghost of the Lady in White\". I ate those stories up, and apparently so did the show's creator. This show takes me back to the years before I learned what character arcs, and plot contrivances were. It strips that all away and just lets me enjoy what it was like to hear ghost stories. What it was like to get chills down my spine every time I rode down a dark road at night expecting an apparition in white to appear. What it was like to come so close to saying \"Bloody Mary\" to the mirror and then passing out. There is a likability to this show that can't be ignored, and there's even some great moments with the two main characters Sam and Dean (played quite well by Padalecki and Ackles) but it is that nostalgic feeling above all that brings me back each week.",

            "review": "Supernatural is gonna draw the obvious X Files comparisons so we might as well get them out of the way now. Its stars are an intrepid duo who travel across America encountering all manner of paranormal phenomena and mythological creatures. It has a lot of ex-files staff too which is apparent if you have watch both shows pretty closely.Supernatural isn't as smart as The X Files , nor is it as cleverly written. The X Files was ahead of the time in many ways and is still unique in others, in that it was a mature drama which took its subject matter very seriously. It managed to blend sci fi and the paranormal skillfully so that you almost didn't notice the seams. Supernatural in a way is like The X Files - lite. It knows what it is and I think is a more focused show then its predecessor. From the get go it lays it out to you that it is situated in a world where ghosts, demons and witches really do exist. Once that is established its on with the show and there is no looking back whereas the X Files constantly had the viewer questioning and thinking about what he was seeing and hearing. Where The X Files was the thinking mans science paper, Supernatural is a camp fire ghost story.Which is more then fine by me. As a lover of ghost stories myself Supernatural makes for fantastic viewing. Its strongest points are its atmosphere and visual imagery. The storyline surrounding the brothers relationship to their father and to each other is in its fledgling stages and will no doubt become stronger over time. Already though it is fun to watch the interplay between Dean and Sam. being the older brother in a family of two myself I find myself sympathising with Dean. Not just because of that but also because I find his personality something I can relate to. His is very Mulder-like in his often whimsical approach to situations. The other brother Sam I find downright annoying at times with the overplayed teen angst.As for the story lines themselves this is Supernaturals weakest point. So far in the first series Supernatural has a basic structure which rarely changes - brothers drive into town, weird things (usually deaths) happen, brothers use fake ID's to find out about the demon / witch / ghost just in time to save the Hot Chick of the Week(tm) wash, rinse, repeat. If it continues Supernatural is in danger of burning out real fast. However in latter episodes there looks to be some sort of mythology developing which should hopefully complicate things. The fathers connection to their mothers death, Sams visions, the Meg demon etc.Having just criticised the story lines I have to admit I love their themes. Each week focuses on a different legend such as the woman in white, bloody mary, vampires etc. Each handled very well and with a surprising amount of knowledge. You can tell that ghost story telling is a real labour of love for the creators. It also introduces a lot of lesser known legends such as the wendigo, shrika etc. Someone is doing their homework and I cant wait to see what creatures appear in later episodes. The references to other supernatural shows such as the x files and ghostbusters is an added treat for fans of the genre. As is the classic rock soundtrack. My god someone has taste. Its like they reached into my mind and put down all my favourite past times on celluloid. Well the ones that can be viewed by under 18's anyway. I wouldn't say Supernatural has \"made scary sexy\". I would say its made scary cool again. If only I could be cool again too. Maybe I would be if I had a Chevy Impala too.All in all an excellent new series dripping with humour, atmosphere and chills.

It was action packed with two bad-ass brothers fighting no not crime, but ghosts. Spirits. The writers have done their research into urban legends and local myths, building on spooks we've grown up hearing about, sometimes beings scared of, and other's apprehensive. They give these spooks a face and then send Dean and Sam to blow them to smithereens.While the coated focus is naturally the supernatural, the deep artery of the show is the love between these brothers as they sort out their past and arguments with \"Dad\" and challenge their future with a new light. They're action packed, gun toting, hot rod driving, (not to mention sexy) heroes saving people from harmful supernatural beings, (as they're not all ghosts). The music choice of the shows is also superb with everything from Blue Oyster Cult's \"Don't fear the reaper\" to Iron Butterfyl's \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\".

Jared Padalecki, of \"Gilmore Girls,\" is a familiar face who gets a chance to toughen up his image a little. The first episode sets up some mysteries to be solved over the season but also has some immediate gratification. No spoilers here ~ you'll have to watch it yourself.

David Nutter, who was involved on the X-Files- hence giving Supernatural that \"X-Files-ish tone\" is a fantastic director. He is a veteran of this field having directed X-Files, Roswell, Dark Angel, Smallville, Disturbing Behavior, Millennium, etc. One of the producers, McG, has produced The OC, and has directed both Charlie's Angels movies. Jared and Jensen are placed in roles they are familiar with, Jared is playing Sam, a character who seems to be a tougher version of Dean, his character from the Gilmore Girls. Jensen is playing Dean, a character who is extremely close to being a human clone of his sarcastic character from Dark Angel, Alec. Opening a WB show with such great effects scores big with me- not giving anything away, the special effects are what Nutter and his team are capable of. Sarah Shahi as a guest star was icing on the cake. The only problem I see with the show is the fact that it is not geared towards the main demographic of the OC and Gilmore Girls (which airs in the time slot before Supernatural) and it may turn away a group of older viewers who may really enjoy it. As long as they don't call it the \"teen X-Files\" or \"Buffy meets Twin Peaks\" it will be fine.

The concept is manipulative, of course, but Blood of My Blood could have had promise.Could have. Unfortunately. BOMB (an interesting acronym) fails to deliver its promise on many levels. First and foremost, unlike Outlander, BOMB lacks the narrative depth so beautifully provided by Diana Gabaldon's novels. BOMB relies on echoes of Outlander while denying the audience the opportunity to experience careful and deliberate character and plot development. BOMB is rushed, plowing headlong into the series without compassion for the viewer. We are to accept what is doled out and be grateful for it.Outlander permits the suspension of belief with its originality, excitement and underlying good humor. We are willing to believe Outlander because it made us want to believe even in the face of its outlandish premise. And this made by its wonderful characterizations of the struggles and hope of Claire and Jamie, portrayed by two actors whose chemistry was electric, bolstered by Galbadon's writings. BOMB captures none of the mystery and magic of its predecessor. Characters pass through stones with alacrity failing to exhibit the traumatic intensity of what just happened to them. No big deal, it appears. Said the Writers: Let's get this whole psssing-through-stones thing over and done with. Let's just mirror Outlander, make the characters mini-me's, yes, caricatures of the originals and sprinkle in easter eggs, toss in gruff and cantankerous Scots throughout and the audience will go for it.Because, you see, BOMB is produced with a specific intent.And the result? A boring, plodding, uninspired, poorly scripted and acted series. Even if one to were regard it as a stand-alone, it's simply not very good. BOMB is a sore disappointment. Critics applaud and I'm mystified. Viewers rave and I understand. It's hard to let go of Outlander.

            "review": "Compared to the first two episodes of \"Outlander\", this prequel is more slow-pace. I was bored the first 30 minutes; it took a little bit longer to intrigue me. No one from the cast stands out as Hollywood's next leading star (yet). Safe to say, no one will be nabbing a bunch of solo magazine covers like Sam Heughan (Jamie Fraser). Other actors could've been casted in these roles, and I would've liked the show just the same (or maybe even more). I probably like Harriett Slater (Ellen MacKenzie) the best, so far. She's definitely a more natural actress than Sophie Skelton (Brianna).It's an ensemble cast right from the start, so no one is overworked to the bone like Caitriona Balfe (Claire) was during the first season of Outlander, as she was in almost every scene.Apparently, the word \"da\" is a Scottish slang. Yet, I thought Brianna was solely using that word because it's less formal than saying \"dad\"? After all, she barely knew Jamie and so saying \"dad\" or \"father\" was too uncomfortable. Everyone says \"da\" on this show though! Weird... that word is not exclusive to just Bri?This \"Blood of My Blood\" cast isn't as fan-friendly as the original \"Outlander\" cast, which is disappointing. Being that they're more-so newcomers, I would expect them to not be jaded yet. Since many of them (with the exception of Rory Alexander and Tony Curran whom are very nice) are already arrogant and rude towards fans, it makes it harder for me to root for them. For a few of them, maybe their handlers or PR personnel are to blame instead, but this attitude needs to change. Stop acting like you are Meryl Streep or Leonardo DiCaprio.Sex scenes are more simplified and conservative, similar to the last few seasons of Outlander so you can definitely tell intimacy coordinators are now used.The unannounced time jumps are a bit confusing, but you'll figure out what time period they're on soon enough.All four of the main characters cross paths and are somehow interconnected, which is cool. I thought the two couples would possibly not cross paths as they're on two separate time periods.I will continue watching.",

Feels completely unearned. The whole point of the first season of Outlander was the slow-burn, the romance, the chemistry. Here there is none of that.I don't really buy the relationship between the dead laird and his daughter either.The brothers are both villains, how are we supposed to root for any of that? And the sisters seem jealous, and there are very few female characters. This is not a show that will pass the Bechdel test.The main girl, a perfect Mary Sue? Charming but clearly from the 21s century\nThe main guy, a very weak copy of Jamie Fraser, makes you feel nothing\nThe other couple (Claire's parents) get given only 3' in the first episode and they are already together in the WWI scene. Guessing that their story is that they get separated and have to reunite? That part seems like just a repeat of the exact same story, the girl travels through the stones after saying \"I'll be right back\"\nThe culture / setting... It was captivating and enchanting in what I remember of Outlander. Sorry but here it just seems primitive, brutal and basic. It's all about gaining/losing power, beating people up, and who's gonna be able to sleep with girls, more or less consensually\nThe first sexual assault attempt is 25' in, the threat of it is constantly present in the dialogues, it's just pervasive. So it doesn't look like this show will be better on that front. Possibly the opposite!And wasn't the first show beautiful? This first episode just looks drab\nThe opening credits are not special eitherIf I could fast-forward as I often do, I might give this more of a chance, but here you have to decipher the dialect, so that's a no-go\nSo yeah, that's a pass!",

            "review": "I have only seen the first two installments of this series and but was impressed enough to leave a review. Charlie Brooker has popped out of the internet at times when I least expect it revealing the more unsettling aspects of our culture through his program Screenwipe and others. That was my first exposure to Doug Stanhope, a comedian who among others brings us closer together via demonstrations of how media and technology are changing our society and rarely for the better. Black Mirror arrives in the form of anthologized science fiction in the vein of the Twilight zone. It is a series that examines our society's relationship with the media and how it allows us to both shape our own identity and imprison us in a space where empathy and truth are weaknesses and something to hide in order to get ahead.I have always been interested in futurists and Brooker seems to fill the requirements for one. There is nothing in the first two installments that do not reflect current trends in our collective behavior but instead extrapolates where current trends in communications technology; avatars, social media and reality television might lead us if we do not seek to preserve what is beautiful and pure about our collective consciousness and humanity.Having seen reviews here that feel there is no commentary embedded within these stories I couldn't disagree more. As the title suggests, Brooker's Black Mirror shows us a dark reflection of our selves and allows us to evaluate these scenarios through our own emotional filters.There are no blatant soap box messages but I interpreted the narratives as cautionary tales and would hope that no one, when confronted with them, would hope for these near futures. The only thing holding them back from becoming reality is our own resistance to complacency and purely spectator culture.Beyond these philosophical aspects, the program is incredibly well produced and executed in my opinion. The characters and sets create convincing realities and I was never once drawn out of the story due to poor acting, scripting or characterizations. I could not recommend this series more and hope that it will continue on. Congratulations to Brooker and company for their work and their apparent concern for all of us.",

Just saw in a review that a guy stopped watching after 20 minutes at the second episode. That's the biggest mistake he could do. Definitely the best episode.

The premise: taking contemporary phenomena (ranging from the wild popularity of talent shows on TV to the impact of social media and smartphones on our lives) as a starting point and speculate how such phenomena could/would evolve in the future. Each episode tells a different story with different protagonists and focuses on a different theme. Of course, the series doesn't explore the beneficial aspects or any positive trends - (where would the fun be in that?) - but clearly approaches its topics from a pessimistic, cynical point of view (hence the title). As the show's creator Charlie Brooker ('Dead Set') puts it: \"...They (the different stories) are all about the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy.\"The resulting mix of bleak sci-fi, drama, satire and black comedy makes for highly intelligent Television and ranks among the most original and entertaining shows I've ever come across. The writing and directing are excellent and the cast includes such talented thesps as Domhnall Gleeson, Rory Kinnear, Toby Kebbell, Hayley Atwell, Jon Hamm, Jason Flemyng and Rupert Everett - to name but a few.

Horrified that someone would conceive and execute such a vile, disgusting piece of television such as this.

The first interpretation is that the show looks inwards, at the darker aspects of humanity and society. This is done through the theme of technology, hence the second meaning. The black mirror is the screen that rules our lives.Each self-contained episode is brilliantly crafted and produced. The stories are compelling and the acting is phenomenal. This show is not for those looking exclusively for entertainment, as the episodes leave you with a distinctly empty feeling. Although this is obviously the intent, one cannot help but wonder at the creators' bleak outlook on the world. The presence of bestiality in the first episode could very well deter some viewers, but I would remind them that the show is Twilight Zone-esque in structure as well as theme. The episodes may be watched in any order, as they are all completely independent of one another. The second episode in particular is storytelling of the highest form.Black Mirror is disturbing in the best possible way. It unflinchingly explores the issues of society through deeply intimate stories and characters and their interactions with technology. Let me be clear, it will not leave you feeling fulfilled. Watching it was an exhausting experience that shook me deeply. The thought provoking subject matter combine with powerful, desolate stories and excellent performances to create one of the most unique and brilliant shows that I have seen.

The fault of a system that didn't care about helping those who showed signs of psychosis and allowed a young man to fall through the cracks along with a corrupt and negligent police department that chose to turn blind eyes and deaf ears due to the nature of homosexuality and people of color being Dahmer's main victims because of obvious systemic racism...all of it set to Evan's performance was outstanding.

The first 6 or 7 episodes were compelling but then something happened, as though the director suddenly chickened out. Later victims and Dahmer's experiments with injecting his victims in the brain to create a zombie he could control, were completely ignored. A relationship with one of his victims was invented and an occupant of his apartment block was invented. Then suddenly and for no apparent reason, the whole story stopped being about a serial killer and became all about civil rights with it being suggested that Dahmer's motivation was racist. Dahmer was many things but he was an equal opportunities killer. He chose victims because he found them beautiful and the colour of that person was not his concern. I don't understand why the series suddenly went down this cul-de-sac. Yes, he could have been caught earlier if the police had done their job but that is a different story about institutional racism in the USA and nothing to do with Dahmer, his actions or motivation.",

            "review": "Starting in July 25, 1991, notorious serial murderer Jeffrey Dahmer (Evan Peters) is arrested when Dahmer's potential victim Tracy Edwards (Shaun J. Brown) miraculously escapes and brings the police back to his apartment. Dahmer is arrested after uncovering the various horrors and mementos from Dahmer's murders, we soon go back through Dahmer's past to see what lead him to this point before eventually shifting focus to the stories of the victims, the fallout felt by the community and victims' families, as well as the bureaucratic and law enforcement failures that allowed Dahmer to continue indulging his twisted appetites.Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is the latest project from noted producer Ryan Murphy whose prolific work on the likes of American Horror and Crime Story lead to him getting an overall deal with streamer Netflix. Beginning development in 2020, the miniseries is the fourth dramatic take on the infamous serial killer following three independent productions, 1992's The Secret Life, 2002's Dahmer, and 2017's My Friend Dahmer receiving very degrees of responses with My Friend Dahmer arguably the best of the three. When the miniseries was first announced I was skeptical because I didn't think there was any more to be told about Dahmer than we'd already learned from years of rubbernecking let alone three film attempts, but much to my surprise I found this miniseries to not only exceed my expectations, but shattered them as Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is one of the year's best TV shows and if you end up seeing only one Dahmer related piece of media in your life, make it this one.While the show may be titled after serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, he's only half of what this movie is about. While the first 3 or four episodes dive extensively into Dahmer's childhood from age six where he first began to manifest his macabre interest in dead animals and dissecting them through his teens and 20s where we see the effects of Dahmer's unstable homelife, repressed homosexuality, and darkening appetites, the movie places more focus on the lead-up to Dahmer's actions as well as the fallout that came after the horrifying revelations came to light (and not just with Dahmer himself). Intermixed with the scenes of Dahmer socially engineering his victims, struggling with keeping his compulsions in check, or failure to maintain professional and personal relationships, we're shown a series of failures either through incompetence, apathy, distraction or neglect that disregard the obvious warning signs surrounding Dahmer as he deals with barely concealed issues that are missed by parents, educators, law enforcement, or administrative officials with those who actually try to shine a light on Dahmer's actions ignored at best or punished or threatened with punishment at worst. This is a show that despite being set in the early 90s is no less prescient today with issues such as systemic racism and homophobia still very much allowing inaction or harm to victims, and an award ceremony scene where two police officers are rewarded for simply avoiding responsibility for handing a child over to Dahmer will make your blood boil with how little has changed in regards to the \"blue wall of silence\" and the corruption of police unions in keeping unfit officers out of the profession.The acting is solid across the board. Evan Peters is really good is the titular Dahmer as he captures the tragedy of his situation in the early years, but Peters and the creative team don't try to use this as an excuse or easy answer (an epilogue says as much there's no simple answer) and Dahmer's metamorphosis from struggling confused adolescent to cold calculating opportunistic predator who justifies his actions with a false victimhood complex makes it clear that Dahmer's actions have no \"out\" from his responsibility for them. The movie is an ensemble and features a number of characters either recurring or one off who are integral to the plot. Easily my favorite comes in the form of deaf actor Rodney Burford who plays Dahmer's victim Tony Hughes and the entire episode is anchored to the POV of this character with characters using ASL to communicate, muffling the audio to create verisimilitude, and you feel like you get to know Hughes in a way we've never been allowed to see before. Make no mistake, this is a starmaking performance from Burford so expect to see much more of him in the future, I guarantee it. The show also features terrific performances from arguably the two \"cores\" of this movie, Niecy Nash as Dahmer's neighbor and until now unsung hero of this story Glenda Cleveland, and veteran character actor Richard Jenkins as Dahmer's torn and conflicted father Lionel.With Nash's Glenda, we get the feeling of powerlessness and helplessness from the people on the ground affected by Dahmer's actions as noted in the movie that Dahmer lived in a cheap rundown part of Milwaukee and targeted mostly people of color as his victims. While Glenda reports the awful smells coming from Dahmer's apartment to the landlord as well as sounds of screening of fighting to the police, not only is she often ignored, but is shouted down by the police such as the infamous incident wherein officers John balcerzak and Joseph Gabrish took Dahmer's word that 14 year-old Konerak Sinthasomphone was actually his drunk 19 year old boyfriend instead of his victim who'd been given an amateur lobotomy by Dahmer instead of an escaped victim despite Glenda's pleas. The movie isn't excessively gory as the gore is limited to only plot important scenes, but just because it's not as bloody as Saw or Hostel doesn't make it easier to watch and in some cases it's actually harder. Richard Jenkins is really strong as Dahmer's father Lionel and the different points of the story that portray him as wanting to help his son but not knowing how are heartbreaking because you see in Lionel the confusion and discomfort that make him unable to give Dahmer the help he needs because he very much denies there even is a problem and tries to write it off as something that can be cured with tough love or firm guidance. There isn't any singular point of blame you can link to Dahmer (as the show isn't about \"understanding Dahmer\"), but the show does give us some potential issues such as a mentally unstable mother, a distant father, and internalized feelings of abandonment, but even then these aren't frame as excuses. The show stays good even after the actual crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer are over and done with by the halfway point, as the show shifts focus away from Dahmer and looks at the media fallout, the insane fandom surrounding Dahmer, the exploitation of tabloids and indie comics that trivialize Dahmer and his victims, and to watch these victims and their families be at the mercy of harassing phone calls and invasive pictures by rubbernecking tourists is painful to watch.If I haven't made it clear, Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is one of the best TV projects I've seen this year and I can't recommend it enough. My one point of criticism is I felt certain tangents related to Ed Gein and John Wayne Gacy seemed a little out of place and I wasn't sure why they were presented the way they were with such polished detailed flashbacks, but other than that one misstep I really think everyone should see this show.",

The only good reason to watch this is to see Richard Jenkins' performance as Dahmer's father, because it's some incredible acting.The show itself is so... confused. It doesn't seem to know what it wants to do. On one hand it's trying to appeal to true crime fans that want to watch and hear about the most lurid and disgusting stuff imaginable. It wants to be a show about the philosophical implications of a person like Dahmer even existing. It wants to talk about the psychological conditions that bring about people like him. And it wants to do some social commentary about the police, racial issues.As you can imagine, it does none of this, because it doesn't have a focus. So what you've got is the first half that just feels like a personal story of Dahmer's, and the second which is like some boring, cliched drama about the families and the fallout of what's happened.As other reviews were asking, what is the purpose of this story? Was it to cover Dahmer? That's been done before, and it's not like it appeals to such a huge audience. Was it to explore philosophical questions of good and evil or maybe talk about policing issues in some places? Probably way better cases you could work with if that's your intent.The reason I'm giving it a 5 rather than a 7 is because the moral messages this show conveys aren't just twisted, they're also hypocritical. It celebrates Dahmer's death at the hand of some lunatic as if that's some great deed. It tries to say that it's a bad thing that some stupid comic featuring Dahmer wasn't banned, even as this show VERY GRATUITOUSLY depicts the killing of his real victims. Like, what?... It's pretending to be this respectful quasi-documentary that's imparting valuable lessons when it's anything but. It's damning what a hubristic view these creators have of themselves.Should you watch this? Not really. Any scenes worth your time will probably be on Youtube, and the whole package is not worth the 10h investment. There's nothing to learn here and nothing to gain.",

            "review": "For those interested in the psychology of a serial killer, there is no more fascinating character study than Jeffrey Dahmer. He was a psychiatric enigma and a profoundly sick individual. A chronic alcoholic from a very young age. A sexual deviant with all manner of unusual fetishes. A necrophiliac. A cannibal.A pure psychopath and the product of a perfect storm of schizotypal/borderline personality disorder, developmental toxicity (exposure to psychoactive drugs in utero), negative parental influence, neglect and childhood trauma, a morbid curiosity with the macabre, social exclusion at school and deep feelings of loneliness, sexual confusion and insecurity.He longed to be cared about and loved by his family. He longed to be accepted by his peers. But, at the same time, knew deep down that he would inevitably disappoint his parents because of his inability to live a normal life and that he wouldn't be accepted by friends due to his odd personality.We all tend to seek out like-minded people and make connections with those we have something in common with. The problem was that Jeffrey knew there wasn't anybody out there with the same interests or outlook as him. Left to his own devices by absent parents and socially isolated, he became increasingly withdrawn and followed a path of introversion and solitude.He must have felt like he didn't belong in this world, and that there wasn't a place for him within society, so he abandoned all attempts to participate and pursued a voyeuristic way of life. He lacked a clear or positive self-image, meaning his perspective of other people was skewed, which resulted in him fully embracing his warped perception of pleasure and satisfaction. The men he felt attracted to were purely sex objects to him; walking, talking sex dolls. His interest was solely in their aesthetic, or physical appearance.He appeared to have been a deeply troubled soul from the outset and his behaviours were predominantly a consequence of his genetic constitution, exacerbated by negative life experiences. If his childhood had been a more positive one then he may have been able to adapt better to his personal limitations and dysfunctions, but there is no way of knowing the extent of the damage his upbringing had on him.It was evident from his own admissions that he felt predestined to live a peculiar and unorthodox lifestyle due to his innately bizarre persona. The conventional joys of life simply didn't float Jeffrey's boat.I rarely, if ever, feel sorry for multiple murderers, especially ones who commit such heinous and sickening crimes as Dahmer. But I have to admit that I found his story to be tragically sad.My usual take away from accounts of serial killers is wondering how and why someone could do that to another human being over and over again!? In Dahmer's case, I am left feeling conflicted with a strange understanding of, and empathy for, his actions. Of course I'm not condoning what he did, but I can appreciate how and why the sequence of events transpired.In his televised interviews he was so open, frank and forthcoming which is exceptionally rare for someone in his situation. He came across as a gentle, thoughtful and articulate person who was genuinely tormented by his inner demons throughout his life. He freely admitted to his crimes in detail, demonstrated that he knew what he had done was evil and offered honest explanations for his actions. He wanted to pay the ultimate price for his sins, resisting advice to make a plea of insanity, and took personal responsibility for the choices he made.The good part of him wanted to change and stop what the bad part had started, but he required external intervention to do so. The urges and compulsions that controlled him became an obsession and his psychosis led him down a progressively irreversible path that was impossible to resist. The dark side had an unrelenting grip on him.My personal opinion is that he was clinically insane, due to a combination of psychiatric disorders, but at the same time I feel a legal judgement of insanity would have been an insult to the families of Dahmer's victims and an inadequate penalty for such a fiendish series of killings.If you listen to him describe how he felt during his childhood and adolescence, it's clear that he should have been under the watchful eye of mental health professionals from an early age. His mother was so wrapped up in her own mental illness and his father preoccupied by work that he didn't receive the emotional support, medication and therapy he desperately needed. This was inexcusable given that both parents were acutely aware of their own emotional problems and the likelihood that these had been passed onto their son.I can't help but feel pity for Dahmer, and also that the casualties of his maniacal way of life were preventable.Between his mid-teens and early twenties he was basically a \"walking cry for help\" but nobody seemed to pay attention, try to understand him or find out what was wrong. In any case, because of the appalling and unspeakable nature of Dahmer's fantasies, it's unlikely that he would have felt able to share them with anyone, even those in a medical capacity. This would've made him feel trapped and that he might as well turn his fantasies into a reality because there was nobody to confide in and no way out of his spiralling mental condition. Like a lost cause.I mean here was a guy who felt completely alone in the world. A total and utter misfit. So reckless and uncaring about what other people thought of him, making absolutely no attempts whatsoever to conform to social norms. A loner without even a rudimentary inclination or understanding of how to make friends, relate to others or find a romantic partner. He didn't seem to know what to look for or what he wanted in a partner. His perverted version of attachment and sexual arousal didn't allow him to.I suppose all he had experienced was watching his parents at constant loggerheads and in a loveless marriage. This would have left him detached, emotionally stunted and unaware of how to express love and affection. I suspect realising that you're homosexual is a troubling and confusing time for anyone. But for someone like Dahmer, who was mentally unhinged and devoid of emotional support, it was a major dilemma and yet another psychological obstacle to contend with.He was given such an unstable start to life by bickering, neglectful parents who appeared to be unwilling to put their children's welfare first. This obviously had a massively detrimental impact on his self-esteem and sense of security, leading to an intense fear of abandonment. Hence his preference for duping his victims into spending time with him and then incapacitating them so he could enjoy their company without that fear of rejection. That way he could exercise total control over their lifeless bodies and indulge in his fetishes to his heart's content without contest.I expect he sank to unimaginable depths of depravity during those private moments, searching for the unachievable, ever-fleeting sense of fulfilment and satisfaction that he desperately wished to hold on to and savour.I've read quite a lot about Dahmer online, watched a number of interviews and the brilliant film 'My Friend Dahmer'. Evan Peters portrays him with a seemingly effortless and convincing performance that is heavily nuanced and intensely creepy. He absolutely nails the flat affect, monotone voice and distinct lack of emotional expression typical of most psychopaths.He really conveys the emptiness Dahmer had in his soul; the numbness, subdued anger and sexual frustration which engulfed him. He truly embodies Dahmer and was perfectly cast in this role.Technically speaking this series is very well researched, skilfully put together and held my undivided attention throughout. The acting by the whole cast, especially Richard Jenkins as Lionel, is first class. The tone is pitched perfectly for such a grim and sordid story. The directors create numerous moments of highly suspenseful and tense drama including some horrifying, darkly-intimate and cringe-inducing scenes, but these are needed to tell the story of Dahmer's debauchery in full.Episode 6 \"Silenced\" in particular is an exceptional and highly original piece of screenwriting with some of the most absorbing television I've seen for a long time. It was like a mini-masterpiece of melodrama.I really feel the writers got inside the mind of Dahmer, not only giving us the facts of what happened but allowing us to feel what it was like to see things the way he did. There are a number of minor adjustments or expansions to the narrative, but equally some omissions in order to make the content more palatable for the viewer. None of this affects the credibility of the series in my opinion as we are given ample opportunity to form a mental image of what happened from the point of view of all parties concerned.Despite having read up on the subject matter beforehand, and knowing how the events of his life unfolded, this excellent series has a real edginess and provides a fresh, unflinching and comprehensive account of the disturbing life of Jeffrey Dahmer.If like me you're fascinated by how a monster like Dahmer is formed, you're in for a real treat.",

This is when the story began to move away from Dahmer and his actions somewhat, and began to concentrate on other aspects of the case and the people who surrounded him. This disconnect just grew and grew into the ensuing episodes, with Dahmer being present, less and less. While some viewers may not have minded this, and perhaps viewed it as being 'thorough', to me, it was fluff and fill. There's is no convincing me that this series would not have benefitted from being two episodes shorter. In fact, you could turn it off at episode 6, and could truthfully say you saw it in its entirety, ...or at least all its best parts.",

A guy so monotone, robotic and sleazy anyone with a brain would run the opposite direction...That's how Peters decided to play an actual non-fiction person, who was, indeed, a human monster, but the monster comes from what he did when he got what he wanted and was able to DO what he wanted...But the problem here is there's no character-arc for Dahmner... He starts out a droning freak and winds up the same way... As for his accent, it seems unnatural and put-on... performed...Meanwhile the pace doesn't flow; it's a real slog to get through.... There are so many interesting aspects of Dahmer's life to be studied, to experience, and yet the entire thing feels like it's deliberately slow-motion-arthouse-weird for the sake of style instead of substance...Through school, through the army, through gay bar hookups, through everything in Dahmer's entire life including interrogation, he's a one-dimensional cardboard-cutout of how a novice acting student would IMAGINE a crazy person to be...And many good reviews are noting how off-putting and creepy this is, but... if everything's off-putting, what's there to compare it with? In fact, most of the other characters, from his victims to bosses to the police and especially Richard Jenkins as his dad, are equally as stone-faced and drowsy...Overall, MONSTER is more like another chapter of American Horror Story instead of an actual serial killer biopic... and those can be amazing, but Ryan Murphy and his boy are too stuck in their usual pretentious rut to let an actual story (of an actual person) shine through.",

He came across as an unassuming nice regular Joe schmo. Maybe it's the writing and direction's fault but there are tons of interviews and trial footage to create from so why make up completely inaccurate scenes that discredit the victims true experience? It does a major disservice to the poor victims. I don't like that, especially considering the situation involving the 14 year old boy (character assassination) ALSO.: (The moment with the cops is almost accurate, but should have been handled differently). The Niecy Nash character didn't even live in the same building as him! Get out of here with this fictional mess.Yes, there are a tiny few solid moments and some of the production designs are spot on, but the inaccuraricies outweigh the few small good moments combined with a lot of boring filler and too many flashbacks. All in typical tasteless Ryan Murphy fashion (couldn't even think of an original title).

Things that he possibly couldn't know. It's all fiction and filler. Meanwhile you're taken away from what you came for, to learn about Dahmer the Serial Killer and his psyche. There is no real exploration in to that or the horror his victims endured. It's really just a fictional puff piece sprinkled with factual events. And Evan Peters was not the right actor for this.

Have Netflix really sunk that low?It would be different if it was an informative documentary, something like a collection of interviews with criminal psychologists, police, and victim's family members if they were willing, don't glorify him in any way, but just talk about what he did and try to explain why he did these things, maybe something positive could come out of that because people could learn how these monsters are created and we could all try to make sure that stuff doesn't happen again, but this is just cheap heat, it shocks people (and it should) but that is not automatically a good thing.If they really wanted to make something like this then they should have made it about Jack the Ripper or other cases like that, because it happened so long ago that everyone involved has been dead for a very long time. So I'm sure this is probably well made as far as tv shows go, but I think it is very tasteless and unnecessary to make a tv show about this creep, and I think it is even sadder that it is currently number 1 on Netflix.

It was like they got tired and dropped the ball. Watch all the interviews of Dahmer on YouTube and you'll see how they depicted him in prison in the series is nothing like how he really was then. They kept trying to portray him as evil and sleazy even though he was not and was repentant (he was found not to be a psychopath when tested, and even his doctors were genuinely sad to hear of his passing). As a psychology student, Dahmer has always fascinated me for the uniqueness of his psychology and how he wasn't truly evil like other serial killers, just incredibly sick.The thing that made me want to turn the show off was how they just had to stick in the rumor of Jeff taunting prisoners with food. That is completely untrue, it was a statement made by Scarver (his killer) when he was trying to get a book deal. Originally Scarver had said God told him to kill those inmates, and he also killed someone else at the same time. It had nothing to do with taunting. Also, according to Patrick Kennedy, Jeffrey had been in isolation for his own protection the entirety of his sentence until he finally asked to be released into general population even though he said he knew he would probably be killed there. And at least one officer who worked at the prison said Jeffrey was a model inmate on his way to medium security for good behavior. Inaccuracies like this are predictable but irritating.

Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly.As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the \"normal\", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future.My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

For example the plot may have been overdone or under thought , direction may have been all over the place , but the first episode proved that it was not to be so.The plot looks delicious...yes it does and the neat direction just purely compliments the smooth design of the show. Even though story telling is non linear at times , but it has been managed very well with subtle dialogue and the growing suspense. It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.The casting is clever...very clever. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are brilliant actors and at the same time have a certain mystery about them that is Perfect for the show. They have a firm grip of their respective characters and seem dissolved in them.This show is NOT just a regular cop drama or a clichéd murder mystery. It is much much more and has already proved so in the first episode. Much is expected from it and the future looks bright for True Detective.UPDATE ( Episode 2-6 ) - Now 6 episodes have gone by and i believe my views have changed a little. The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes. From the 4th episode is when the show actually picked even more momentum and proved its worth as possibly the greatest thing on television at the moment. McConaughey is truly having the golden period of his career. The future (probable) Academy Award winner (For DBC) is at his freaking best as Rust Cohle. Harrelson is brilliant as the angry and flawed Marty Hart. I liked this show. But now i am addicted to it.With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.So far, an obvious 10/10.Final update: ( Episode 7 & 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless. Am gonna miss it.10/10",

I had no idea what I was in for when I turned it on, but I'm hooked, and can't wait for the next and the next and the next...secrets abound, tantalizing clues are everywhere, but where do they lead.

The following two seasons are watchable and well-made but nowhere near as phenomenal as season one. This is a paint-by-numbers example of how to do a gripping and unique story. There is nothing negative I can say about season one. Everything is top-notch. The acting, the story, the camera work, the music, the mood, everything.We see through the relationship of the two main characters a complicated and sometimes volatile relationship. They aren't enemies but they aren't exactly friends either. The dialogues they share together are some of the most interesting filmmaking I've ever seen. They aren't good men or bad men either. They exist in the grey area. They are just good enough to not be bad but bad enough to not be good. They are stark contrasts of one another as well. The relationship Rust and Marty have evolves constantly throughout the series and is the highlight of the entire show. I cannot recommend this season enough.",

Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey do a great job. The script is very well written and drives the story hard. This show is all about the story. It has the feel of a mini series not a TV show so it will be interesting to see where it goes. But it is one powerful script that is acted out great. This is the first 10/10 I think I have given on IMDb. Once you watch it you will know why. I will be shocked it this show does not win awards. It may be the best show on HBO now and I would say it's up there with orphan black with it's ability to grab your attention and keep you glued.",

            "review": "Last spring (2014) while surfing IMDb for a new show to watch I came across True Detective, a show that had received rave reviews across the board. I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.Season 1 verdict: If I had to give only season 1 a rating, I would give it a 9/10 with no hesitation, and possibly even a 10/10. The show was everything I had hoped for and more.Needless to say, I was excited for season 2. I waited for the entire show to air so that I could binge watch it without having to wait a week between episodes. I eagerly turned on the first episode of season 2, but as the episode dragged on it became apparent that this episode was a real let down. It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. \"Hey, that's okay\" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved. Instead, I continued to be disappointed by episode after episode. Sadly, it became very clear that Season 2 sucks. I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result. Season 2 is basically unwatchable.Most of Season 2 involves a few seriously depressed brooding alcoholics staring at each other with sad serious faces uttering dark cheesy lines like \"Those moments, they stare back at you, you don't remember them, they remember you\". I mean, come on, really? The whole thing is just cheesy and I lost all interest in the problems of these people. I want to give Vince Vaughn some credit here, because he did some fantastic acting, but that couldn't come close to redeeming this season.Season 2 verdict: Don't even bother with season 2 unless you like being disappointed. It sucks, plain and simple.",

When you have Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson playing the leads, the hope & expectation rises & judging by first viewing, they look like they wont disappoint. They are both very different characters, we get to know how they were in the 90s, and how they have changed into the present day, and how they both have individual issues. The overall feel of the show is a little dark, but the mood seems perfect for the show & the cast compliment this brilliantly so far.

The way the story is told emphasizes a reality of soft sciences and ancient Whats if thinking and calling it soft sciences. Overlooking leads because of leniency towards soft crimes like bulgary and picketpocking, which was the number 1 error of logic in this case. And it was only under appeals that that she found a judiciary that was willing to see the egregious and erroneous investigation and evidence mishandling. It was in par with Salem and witch trials And even after being acquitted they still held her because she said a cop hit her. Which is believable.I'm glad she gets a chance to finally be heard.

We then go to \"June 16, 2022\" and Amanda is seen hiding in a car under a blanket, apparently on her way back to Perugia, where this twisted tale got started... At this time we are 5 minutes into Episode 1.Couple of comments: first of all, there seems to be a number of reviewers who give this mini-series a (very) high rating because, as we all know, Amanda's conviction was eventually overturned, and not whether this is or isn't a great true crime mini-series (have they even seen the mini-series?). Second of all, this is not an \"objective\" mini-series, far from it. In fact, per the series closing credits, the series is based on the 2015 best-selling memoir by Amanda called \"Waiting To Be Heard\". And for good measure, Amanda is credited as one of the series Executive Producers (listed right above Monika Lewinsky, no, for real). So what you are getting here is Amanda's version of what happened, nothing more, nothing less. It is on that basis that I struggled getting through the initial 2 episodes, as the from get-go, the Italian authorities are portrayed as fumbling-bumbling-stumbling Inspector Clouseau (of the Pink Panther movies) copy cats, with a never-ending series of questionable interrogation tactics and correlated investigative procedures. Is that how it really happened? We have no clue but I can't help to have some doubts that what really happened isn't so grossly one-sided as is being presented here. The good thing is that the Amanda Knox case will continue to attract major interest from the public at large, and that almost certainly one day a more objective and independent version of the facts will be presented.The initial 2 episodes of \"The Twisted Case of Amanda Knock\" started airing earlier this week, and are now also streaming on Hulu, where I watched this last night. The remaining 6 episodes will be released on a weekly basis (on Wednesdays). If you are interested in hearing from the one-sided horse's mouth what really happened in this case, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion (even if the conclusion has already been drawn for you).",

Aside from the sarcastic \"smart kid,\" who at least brings a spark of wit to his scenes, the performances range from wooden to outright cringeworthy. It's a parade of C-tier acting that does nothing to sell the gravity of the story. And the tone? Pure CW. Every scene feels like it's aimed at a teenage audience more interested in angsty stares than in the moral darkness at the heart of King's work.Pacing is another issue. By halfway through episode two, we'd seen little more than shallow character introductions and clumsy exposition. The supposed tension never arrives. Atmosphere is non-existent. Instead of pulling me into a dark psychological maze, the series kept me at arm's length with bland dialogue and a flat visual style.We pulled the plug after 1.5 episodes. Not out of impatience, but because it was clear this wasn't going anywhere worth following. It's a shame-there's real potential in The Institute's source material, but this adaptation strips it of nuance and replaces it with hollow drama beats.Unless you're a die-hard fan of low-stakes teen thrillers, don't waste your time.

I would cut what happened in those 2 episodes down to less than one or punch up those beginning scenes. Maybe some scenes could have been pushed to flashbacks later. You need to hook your audience as soon as you can or lose them. One specific important character that was in the book should have been introduced earlier. Pull out the William Goldman, Sy Field, or Robert McKee. Missed opportunity is the specific social commentary in the novel seems absent here. It is a tough one to say about the actors but uninspired for some might be the best description along exhaustion. I am not sure the night shoots had a part in that. Wishing for a jolt of espresso for some. What is refreshing is normally good girl Parker and normally bad boy Barnes have a bit of a role reversal with Parker being the antagonist and Barnes being the protagonist. In true King fashion the minor quirky characters are outstanding based on the material they had to work with. Pls stop saying this is Stranger Things cause Stranger Things borrowed a lot from King novels. I am such a King and Parker(Weeds anyone?) fan that I will try to watch the rest.

The fault of this one, in my opinion, falls squarely on the shoulders of the writers. Had this challenge been placed in more capable hands, I believe it could have had serious potential of becoming an excellent series. Some creators - take Mike Flanagan for instance - take the time and effort to truly understand the source material and recognize what can be changed to enhance the adaptation for the screen. In the case of The Institute, the changes the writers made had the opposite effect. The character of Ms. Sigsby, for instance, is little like the character in the novel. Had her part been adapted properly, and placed in the very capable hands of Mary-Louise Parker, it would have made a world of difference. Ms. Parker is an extremely talented and versatile actor and would have taken this series to a higher level, had her role been better written. Also disappointingly, Ben Barnes' talent is mostly wasted here as well. To sum it up, it's doubtful I'll continue watching this series.

            "review": "Wow. I just finished episode 12 of the first season of this show. As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I feel like I'm about 12 years old again. To me, the thing about the Star Wars universe that fascinated me was never the jedi, or the mysticism, or the lightsabers. All that was cool, but to me, the fascination was for the struggle. The underdog vs the world. The fight against oppression. From the original series, Wedge was my favorite character- just a regular guy doing his part.Return of the Jedi was always my favorite, despite its flaws. The reason was the epic battle sequence at the end. Unlike basically every piece of star wars media since, ROTJ's battle focused extensively on regular 'people'. This is what the Ewoks represented- an oppressed civilisation. It's a little hokey in practice, but the message was the important thing. Likewise, the space battle was all regular pilots doing their best to survive a last-ditch battle. Green Leader going out of control and kamikazi-ing the super star destroyer, Wedge and Lando shooting out the reactor. Again, these were regular people doing their bit to fight the empire. The Rebel Alliance is built on THEIR backs, not those of some space wizard (all respect to Luke).To me, Star Wars media lost sight of that until Rogue One. Here, they continue (or start) the tradition by focusing on Andor.Let's be clear, Cassian Andor is not really the protagonist here. The Rebel Alliance is, and Cassian is the perspective through which we are seeing it, as a regular guy down on his luck finding his way in the galaxy despite a world of harshness thrown at him. Likewise, we see it from the perspective of its architects, Mon Mothma, a politician doing it 'straight', and Luthen Rael, a spy/terrorist playing the deeper, more violent game. We also see the Empire as the antagonist, through the eyes of those who wish for order, like Syril Karn, and a promising and talented ISB agent, Dedra Meero.There are no jedi or lightsabers here, and surprisingly few battles and pew-pews. Almost no jokes, and (amazingly) no \"I have a bad feeling about this.\"What we get instead, and what I have needed from this franchise for a very long time, is incredible acting. Unbelievably good writing, and fantastic attention to detail. This is one of the most well-made shows I've ever seen. Every character's action, good or bad, makes sense here. This is Star Wars, the Real Drama, where I can simultaneously understand the perspective of a Rebel and an Imperial. I may not agree with one, or even both, of them, but I understand them.... I might even sympathise with them. It is like The Wire in the star wars universe. It really is THAT good.I have no notes for this. There is nothing I can imagine that would make it better. It may not be for kids or for everyone. It is slow. It has relatively little action and no humor. But- if you enjoy suspense, and tension, in a Hitchcockian way.... you MUST watch this. If you're a star wars fan who enjoyed the series for those regular men and women in the background, then again, you must watch this. If you are a fan of revolutionary or antifascist history, you must watch this.I cannot wait for Season 2.OK- it's 7 May 2025. I've come back to make a slight edit after watching episodes 1-9.All I can say is... I wish there would be a Season 3. I think Season 2 is forced to be just a *little* clunky in the way it skips years between three-episode arcs... but my god is that a minor critique. The acting. The writing. The production value, set design, costumes... I do not know if it is possible to make a show that is as incredibly high-quality as this.If you aren't watching this... just watch it.If you don't enjoy the absolute tension and drama... well downvote me because we're just not on the same wavelength.I wish all Star Wars... hell all media.. was this good.",

Of what a terrible wasted opportunity the rest of this latest run of Star Wars output has been (with just the occasional, infuriating glimmer of quality thinly veined through Obi-Wan and The Mandalorian).Here's hoping the rest of this series manages to capitalise on this great start, and leaves us with at least one more properly good piece of work in this third age of Star Wars.",

When confronted with enemy after enemy, Andor continually proves himself to be the perfect sort of spy, revolutionary and killer.Thank you, Tony Gilroy, for creating this series.

Though the first two episodes are a bit slow and offer pretty low-stakes, with lots and lots of exposition, Luna pushes the series, one of his best performances yet, to excellence. Episode three, especially, is WOW. His power to add nuance to what starts as a one-dimensional personality - surly dude disillusioned with his surroundings - is remarkable. We're lucky he reprised his role. Adding a tiny note here, I love how Luna keeps his native Mexican accent in all his portrayals of Cassian Andor. It adds something to the role! The plot of Andor is simple enough, and this allows for both the trademark character development and world-building of the Star Wars universe and also the slow reveal of the Rebel Alliance forming. Stellan Skarsgård's portrayal of Luthen Rael is subtle without being dry, and he helps elevate the show and make it even more riveting. The production quality, much like the acting, is off the charts; every scene is engineered to be utterly stunning. Half the time the feeling of dread is offset by, \"oh my goodness, look at the sky.\" All of this - the new tone, new feel, new style - might be too different for some, but the utter novelty is to be appreciated. Finally, the beautiful score by Nicholas Britell adds so much to the retro-futurism of Andor and makes the performances pop even more.Andor promotes fighting for good causes, allowing yourself to be taken by passion, and leading others for the greater good. Beyond these lessons, it's also a master class (tonally, visually, sonically) for filmmakers playing in the sandbox. There are some sexual undertones in the first episode and violent scenes.I give Andor 4.5 stars out of 5 and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. Andor releases on Disney+ September 21, 2022.

The quality of Andor is a full head above.Or take Obi-Wan, that is a remarkable impotency of story writing and directing, having no reasons to exist but to exploit the fan base.Since Rogue One, we see another successful try to make a \"realism\" show instead of arcade.Creative script, good acting, dynamic development. It's great when quality and creativity wins over safe-betting and prioritizing fan-service for the sake of extra cash grab.I just hope Disney doesn't spoil the series. But knowing the company, I won't be surprised. Still, so far Season 1 is extraordinary good and is exciting completely irrelevant of any other SW lore.",

I couldn't have been more wrong, especially because \"The Boys\" it's not about a desperate attempt of superheroes to save the world from evil, instead this show takes a much more realistic approach, about what is going to happen if superheroes had really existed.I'm saying that I had big expectations in the beginning, because I thought that it would be the same usual show with superheroes and villain, that is most likely to find everywhere. In the first couple of episodes I've been a little bit disappointed, or rather shocked, because like I've already said, \"The Boys\" describes what the MCU never did. Of course, the movies and shows from Marvel are destined to other public's category, but this show is tough. It has all you could not expect from a TV series with superheroes. It has violence, gore, nudity, astonishing CGI effects and a very unpredictable and solid storyline. In the end it seems that this one delivered what I didn't expect it to and I am pleased with that.

I will say that I enjoyed it.The only other show I truly miss is Fox's The Inside. That was a good one as well but nothing like this. I have bought at least ten books on profiling that discuss different types of psychopaths,how they were created and the different psychological issues that surrounds their behavior and fantasies. How because of their bad experience during childhood and after they have learned to profile and manipulate people,the disorganized crime scene compared to organized scene and mixed crime scene and what it tells you about the unsub. Learning their geographic profile. All these things are in this show to give us a pretty reasonable idea of what they do. How they are made. Why they exist and do what they do. I find it fascinating not only to watch psychopaths and their crimes but to some extent through their fiction, learn something about them. John Douglas says he saw John Gacy and looked him right in the eye when in fact he never did so I don't really take his word about what his job was like. But many others, like Robert Ressler describe this profession in a similar way as Criminal Minds. I hope it stays on. It is the coolest. Just to clarify, I like learning why they do it. I hate what they do and how it hurts people. I don't wan't people to think I enjoy entertainment for the sake of seeing people pain or horror. I think you will enjoy this show too.

If you think about it, he's more like a professor citing famous lines from Einstein, Faulkner, etc.When I first read those lines, it didn't make sense at first, but as you watch each episode , the lines that Gideon cites has more meaning to it.For example: Einstein: \"Imagination is more important than knowledge.Knowledge is limited.

I normally don't do reviews, however with this show heading into it's 9th season, proper criticism is long overdue. Crime procedurals is not a TV genre I'm a fan of and generally avoid them. However I started watching this show after seeing the short lived series Higher Ground and thinking AJ Cook really had potential. After seeing all her later movies, this show was all that's left so I started watching it and hoped it wasn't too bad. I set my standards too high.Saying this show is unoriginal is an understatement. I don't think there's a single thing about this show that wasn't taken from somewhere else. Heck the creators admits to taking ideas off real life cases. First off the characters. They are cardboard stock characters from other crime procedurals. Some of them are blatant ripoffs when I hear more about other crime procedurals like NCIS and Numbers. You got the old wise mentor, the apathetic boss, the tough guy, the socially awkward genius, the woman who can hang with the boys, the token eye candy, and stolen from NCIS, the computer expert who's suppose to be wild and funny. If they don't sound cliché enough, their distinction is maximized. For example the apathetic boss is so devoid of personality that the actor didn't felt necessary to give him any facial expressions. The tough guy is always the one tackling people. The socially awkward genius has a social past so pathetic Steve Urkel and the geeks from Big Bang Theory come off as more realistic people. The token eye candy (AJ's character) is basically a glorified extra who barely does anything. Their wardrobe never changes either just in case it's not blatant enough what type of characters these are. Boss is always wearing a suit, tough guy is dressed up like he's running a military obstacle course, genius looks like he works in a cubicle, the female agents are dressed up like GQ models and the \"funny\" computer whiz has over the top hair, layers of makeup and an outfit that overall makes her look like some sort runaway from the circus.As for the story, what story? It takes ques from CSI and every other popular CBS crime show of having that overproduced Michael Bay inspired look as well as grotesque and shocking images and ideas. CSI started this with their forensics and dead bodies while Criminal Minds seems to be aiming for as close to Saw levels. Cause you know, Michael Bay and Saw is what people like to flock to. Episodes themselves are completely by the books. Opening scene will be about the case in question. We hit credits then someone on the team will cite some historical figure at the beginning and end of every episode. This idea apparently was stolen from another crime show. Team presents the case so the audience can follow what's going on. Killer is almost always a guy, victims is almost always women, local authority is almost always incompetent morons. Team will try and piece things together while the killer is doing something that escalates the matters. This is how episodes constantly keeps you on edge. They will also play overly dramatic music to let the audience know how they should be feeling cause things aren't blatant enough already and this show likes to treat it's audience like morons. Though if people actually think this show has great writing then I guess the creators aren't wrong there. The team figures it at the end then gives a exposition dump, if they haven't already, to the audience, uh, I mean authorities like they're reading off a script. Okay they are actually reading off a script, but you're not suppose to make it look like they are. They always make it in the last moment with tough guy tackling the killer. Case has been solved in the course of a day or two. The End.This is all then repeated in a infinite loop until this show gets cancelled. Everything this show specializes is pretty much everything I hate about the crime procedural genre. There's no story or character development at all. The most you get is if something is happening to the actors in real life (like they're leaving the series) and the writers are forced to accommodate to the change. Speaking of change, the cast has been changed a number of times and the new actor generally looks like the last actor. How original. Well to be fair, they did try the bold move of replacing AJ's token eye candy with Rebecca Locke from the series the Inside. I'm not kidding, it's Rebecca Locke with Rachel Nichols playing her also, except she has CM's craptastic writing behind her. Most of what you know about the characters are given in throwaway lines that never gets followed up on. Not that it matters, whenever they do try and develop these \"characters\", it's always cringe worthy. If the writers just happens to be planning (read: not a reaction to real life) to bring in a character that gets close to a main cast, they are sure to die just for more shock value and things reset back to status quo: the way the writers like it. It's apparent shock value is the only writing skills the staff has. There's not even any concept episodes shows like these like to try out once and a while. You know the episodes that's completely different from the usually. I'm utterly convinced the writers of this series does not have a creative bone in their bodies.I cannot wait for the day this series gets cancelled cause good riddance and hopefully I can enjoy AJ Cook in something again.",

I have no idea how could someone cast \"Mandy Patinkin\" in a lead role. His every single dialog delivery irritates me to the core. This show does not give any technical details on how the killer works or how the profilers are trying to track killers down, but they somehow catch the killers and we have to assume that these guys are experts. This should be called a magic show... Since actors make some face expressions as if they are thinking really hard and after some time magically they catch the killer, without giving viewers any underlying technical details or facts that they are using to track the killer. Do they think viewers are so dumb...?If you want to watch crime detective thrillers then watch CSI - a great show and Bones or Numbers which are good shows and give complete technical details and facts that the characters in the shows put together to arrive at a conclusion, respecting viewers intelligence. Criminal Minds should not be even considered as a below average show. It's waste of viewers time.Finally, do not waste your precious time on this terrible show...",

Every episode involves a last minute 'are they going to make it?' type of plot device. Ultimately, it gets very tiring and predictable.Other than the grisly subject matter, this show feels like it it's being targeted towards the elderly. The dialog is slow, the plots are brutally simple/easy to understand, there's zero pop culture references, there's no need to remember details from previous shows- very little is expected of the viewer.I watched the first 12 episodes (on DVD) in hopes that it would somehow improve/develop a life of it's own.

I watched the wire about 3 years ago well after the series concluded, and watched it in the same binge watching way I watched The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, and Game of thrones. I won't compare The Wire to these shows because they are not really comparable other than the fact they are some of the greatest shows ever, but are completely different. The wire isn't about drug dealing, the police, politics, or the education system, it is about the entire city of Baltimore. I'll admit The Wire isn't for everyone, it may be too violent or complex with the vast amount of characters and side stories for some, but I guarantee if you are a film and TV series lover and appreciate writing, acting, and an abundance of interesting characters, the wire is pretty much perfect in these regards. Each Season changes slightly in which facet of the city it will mainly cover, and becomes more complex as the series progresses. This show has without a doubt some of the most interesting characters, and best writing I have ever seen on a series. Even small side characters have intriguing stories that progress throughout the entire series, and I have never seen more attention to detail. This show isn't built up with such high expectations for people who haven't seen it for no reason, watch it , and there is about a 99.99% chance you will become one of those previously mentioned 3000 people recommending it to everyone you know who hasn't seen it.",

It was described as a \"gritty crime drama\" with many Baltimore locals portraying variations on themselves. The interview made it sound interesting enough that I decided to check out the first season on DVD.After the first few episodes I became seriously hooked and devoted 36 hours of the next ten days to the show.Having now watched the first 3 seasons, I believe it to be the best television series I have seen.I do not understand why this show hasn't generated the buzz or the awards of HBO's other series, such as the Sopranos or Deadwood. It is more gripping, faster paced, and more intelligent. The other shows can be a bit plodding, with plot lines that go nowhere, and a few characters I don't much care about. That wasn't the case here.The show is a cross between the Sopranos and the old NBC show Homicide: Life on the Street. The crime/sopranos side and the law/Homicide side run in parallel. Individually, the parallel plot lines are compelling. In tandem, they are complimentary and brilliant.There is no way to avoid having \"the best show ever\" tag sound like anything but silly hype--regardless, what makes this show substantially better than any other realistic and compelling crime or police drama is the fact it is... searching. It doesn't just delve into the individual psychologies motivating these people (ala the Sopranos) or the complex interactions amongst the members of a community (ala Deadwood) it asks \"what the hell can be done for all of these people\" and points out the problems with any and all of the answers.It's truly brilliant.

I doubt the guy even watched the entire first season. This show is the best thing going on TV. Writing. Direction. Acting. Its all perfection. The people behind the show are former journalists and police officers who were covering crime in Baltimore or working the beat as cops for over 20 years. They know what they speak of and don't rely on cookie cutter characterization. This is the closest thing to a novel that you will find on TV. It is so impeccably plotted and so honest and realistic that I will never be able to watch another cop show (or any TV drama) without comparing it to this example of television greatness. Did I mention its also the smartest TV show on the air too? The Sopranos gets the media attention but it can't match the sophistication and grittiness of The Wire. The Sopranos is a romanticized TV crime drama by comparison. And as for Six Feet Under? Please! It reached its peak in its final six episodes of the first season and haven't lived up to that magic since. It doesn't get any better than The Wire. Universal critical acclaim.

On the surface, one might think this is a show about crime, but really, 'The Wire' is about the life and soul of a whole city. Every aspect of the city of Baltimore gets its share of screen time, and the way this is done - the writing, the direction, the amazing performances by the terrific cast; the music, the camera work, the realism...

Telling of a motley bunch of detectives who set about to bring down a Baltimore drug ring which supplies a black innercity housing project, the gritty 12 hour first year series slowly develops a broad range of characters from street punks to senators in a world where the blacks and whites of good and evil are reduced to shades of gray and everyone is connected by their humanity for better or for worse. Not the usual cops vs bad guys fare with episodic ups and downs, \"The Wire\" is one long drama about people which happens in a law enforcement and crime setting.

It's not easy to watch--and its certainly challenging. But it is surely worth it.The story unfolds in Baltimore and is a study on the effect of institutions on its members: police, politicians, criminals, addicts.Some may find the show didactic. This is understandable because its creators make heavy usage of allegory (for instance, seasons three's not-so-subtle criticism of the situation in Iraq).Didactic or not, the show forces its viewers to think about and hopefully start a larger discussion of the issues it touches upon: the failure of the drug war, the gradual extinction of the American worker and the dangers of a presumptive, preemptive war.Hats off to creators David Simon and Ed Burns (a retired BPD detective) for creating one of the most interesting, daring shows in the history of television.Let's hope HBO renews it for another 26 episodes.",

            "review": "I say that without a shred of hyperbole. The Wire's importance, beyond setting the standard for all modern television, is one of a historical document. 500 years from now, the show will surely be one of a handful that allows future generations to glean the state of American society during this time period -- it's problems, it's people, it's language, it's institutions, and the constant tension that exists when all of these are forced to coexist.This is due to the fact that the Wire, through nuance and true-to- life portrayal of human interactions, constructs an extremely lucid and heart-breaking evaluation of almost every aspect of society. Most of you reading right now wake up every day as a cog in the massive, interwoven, and fundamentally autonomous institutions which together make up a capitalist society. However, given that we are all a minuscule part of this larger whole, it is nary impossible to take a step back and objectively evaluate just how much influence these institutions hold over the course of our lives. It's not unlike trying summarize a 1000-page novel while holding a single random page less than an inch from your face. Our perspectives are inherently limited in this regard, and so too is any vain attempt to connect the pieces and make sense of it all.This point is one of the many reasons that the Wire warrants our time and careful consideration. From a bird's-eye perspective, each season builds on those prior until at the very end we have no choice but to reckon with vast tapestry of individual strands as a singular work. One that feels so true to life that it's near impossible for me to think of anything else, fiction or non-fiction, book or movie, painting or play, sculpture or architectural feat, which in their combined power holds the volume of educational lessons, thoughtfulness, humanism, pure ethos, or entertainment that the Wire does.\"All the pieces matter,\" a quote that flashes across the screen at the beginning of an episode in Season One, is prophetic in it's understanding that the totality of something can have a much greater impact than its individual parts. And that is why I find it upsetting when reading reviewers which call the show \"boring\" or \"slowly paced\" or \"overrated\" and then go on to admit that they gave up watching before the end of Season Two.I am not a cynic by nature and in general tend to dismiss the common criticism that our generation is one that needs constant gratification all of the time in order to stay engaged with something for the long haul. But in this case, I truly believe that the Wire is so much different than what most people are used to watching on the medium of television that some may get confused or frustrated when the show refuses to pander to the standard beats and thrill-inducing plot devices on an episode-by-episode basis which we have been trained to expect with TV shows. There are no neatly wrapped episode arcs, no spoon-feeding over obvious plot points via voice-overs or flashbacks, and no musical score to tell us how a particular scene or moment should make us feel.Instead, the show forces us to become witnesses to a series of events in much the same way we would witness something unfolding right in front of us. Especially during Season One, David Simon and his creative team give us a lot of footage that looks like it should be from a documentary. This is all intentional, of course. The 4:3 film, the non-HD look, the way the camera seems to lack the traditional god- like power to always know that a character is going to say something important so that it shows us that character a second or two before they say their line (indeed, if you watch closely you'll notice that there are times that the camera will only pan to a speaking character after they begin saying their lines, giving the viewer the distinct feeling of a real-life situation unfolding in real time) -- all of these things are by careful design. And all of these devices add to the show's power because the characters become more real when depicted in this way. This makes it all the more devastating every time one of these characters is chewed up and spit out by the merciless wheels of capitalistic institutions surrounding them.I chose to write a review which differs from many of the others here because simply rehashing why I love Omar so much, or which season is the best, or why I think it's better/worse than the Sopranos or Breaking Bad are all things which are touched upon over and over again. Instead I wanted to provide my own analysis about why the show succeeds and stands apart of from others to the point where comparison is futile. Some people, including myself, think that the show will provide you with such an empathy-rich experience that when you have finished you may potentially see the world a little bit differently, that you'll feel a little bit closer to all of the people you share this country with, no matter how different their persona or background is from your own. By this measure, your persistence and patience given to the show will be repaid 10-fold.",

I was told that, once I'd watched it, I'd see what all the fuss was about. Well, I finally finished season 1. I won't be bothering with season 2.This is an average procedural, nothing more or less, stuffed with an array of interchangeable and forgettable characters (I couldn't for the life of me remember who was who, and soon began not to care) and clichés galore. You want the the maverick cop who plays by his own rules, speaks his mind, pisses of his stuffed-shirt, officious superiors but gets results? Whose dedication to his job has cost him his marriage and left him with a drink habit (signalled by occasional swigs at a bottle)? Well, one can never get enough of THIS sort of character, obviously, so bring him on, have him played woodenly and be done with it. You get the usual weary battery of petty, lazy, fat and/or balding officials who get in the way, just for contrast, and they all but ask for his badge and his gun and/or give him 48 hours.And so it dragged on, the self-conscious dialogue dribbling forth. You want the beautiful and ballsy lesbian cop expounding non-sensically on her reasons for being a cop to her (fortuitously gorgeous) lesbian friends? Want to see a fat cop enter his superior's office and start, for some reason, to talk about how he was masturbating in the bath? And, no, his superior does not, as in any real world, ask him to get out or get to the point, but merely smiles and nods indulgently ('cos he's an a-hole, too, geddit?). The cringe moments come thick and fast, one of my favourites being the moment that the cop I came to call Morgan Freeman interviewed the Tart-with-a-Heart (another cliché) at his desk, conveniently littered with the miniature furniture he makes (contrived plot point, there)and for some reason didn't see fit to clear away. He tells her to choose one that she likes and, yes, she chooses the cradle with the baby in it and coos, ickily.Lovers of clichés will also be able to spot who's about to get wasted in advance.

The Wire truly has no equivalent on American TV, more akin to something like the British miniseries Traffik, or Robert Altman's Short Cuts, but really in a class by itself. The show also doesn't fetch the ratings of HBO's other blockbuster series, like The Sopranos or Deadwood, but so far the network has stood behind what is indisputably a creative / artistic success. Viewers accustomed to having a Tony Soprano or an Al Swearingen to latch onto may be daunted by The Wire's 2-dozen or so \"main\" characters, all given equal importance within multiple story lines. The concurrent tales all buoy one another, and as the season draws to a close, they begin to merge and compliment each other in unexpected ways. No detail is too small to not be done with great care, and no significant threads are left to hang, which also speaks to the brilliance of the writers.The Wire is no less than a dramatic triumph, and I can't wait for a new season.",

All you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is. The consistency of the greatness of this show throughout all five seasons is ridiculous. The gritty attention to detail makes this series feel so real. It's easily one of the best shows of all-time.",

Granted, TV series tend to be one dimensional, due to inherent difficulties in the genre, but \"doctor shows\" are something I avoid like the proverbial plague.And then one evening I caught \"House, MD\" and was completely drawn into the show. In House I find the anti-hero that I've been waiting for in a medical show. The guy who knows everything, but is wrong often enough to keep us all guessing. I enjoy the contrast of House and his cadre of young fresh faced colleagues, complete with starched white lab coats, who struggle as much with their professionally imposed constraints, and sense of decorum, as they do with his personality. And, wonder of wonders, the use of ironic and tragic comedy is without peer in what I've seen in the TV world in recent memory. In a nutshell, I really never know what any given character will say or do and it's that freshness that will keep me coming back for more. Somewhere there is a team of writers who actually know their craft, and an acting ensemble that knows how to pull it off. Now I can watch my TV one hour a week........",

House is a unique character to be appreciated among the saps of TV nowadays.I must say something to Hugh Laurie. People complain about his accent. He's English playing an American. I lived in England for a year on exchange. I'm an American. Though I'm no expert on accents, I have to say I didn't notice that Hugh Laurie had any sort of English accent. A slight accent can show if you're really looking for it, but, other than that, he's version of an American accent is great.House is a great show, but it's not for the weak of heart or weak of stomach. It's not like ER at all. House is like the Sherlock Holmes of medicine. It's a drama without the screaming and tears.Sorry if this is a horrible comment, but it's my first review on IMDb of a show :)",

Namely - Dr. Greg House.House is a cranky, cynical highly intelligent doctor with a limp that specializes in weird medical cases. Each week he, and his team of fresh faced young doctors, tackle some new medical mystery. With the use of CSI camera views and mouth-numbing medical jargon, the show tries not to bore you to tears with the specific case.Still, though the cases are entertaining and puzzling, that's not why you should watch this show.Unlike most stale TV cop/medical/lawyer shows out there, \"House\" doesn't focus on the cases alone. Week by week we actually get a chance to...GASP!...learn about the characters! But the character that everyone will be obsessed with his Hugh Laurie's Dr. House.House, even though cranky and unlovable, is a sweet guy at heart. He's the type of guy you want curing you. Though he rarely visits his patients, at least he doesn't sugar coat things for you. He will call you an idiot to your face and you'll love him for it. Each time you watch you'll want to know what else he likes besides \"General Hospital\" and Vicadin pills.Dr. House is hiding out Tuesday nights at 8pm amid all the other bored-with-their-jobs characters. Whenever you're sick of case obsessed Gil Grissom or any Law and Order detective, tune into \"House\".I promise you'll at least leave with a fresh feeling in your brain.",

Dr. House is a bitter but brilliant doctor who is crippled in one leg due to the inability of doctors to properly diagnose his problem in time. This makes him a decidedly bitter person when dealing with others yet he is one of the best doctors in his field of diagnostic medicine. He is being forced to serve his clinic hours that he had avoided for a number of years, and this is where the show takes place; in a walk in clinic. Each show is a mysterious new case that puts the patient's life on the line as time runs out.

I LIKED that as an alternative to ER. Note that ER is my absolute favorite show, and the ONLY show I regularly watch--but they are already doing what they do, and doing it extraordinarily well; a new show ought to do something DIFFERENT, it seems to me.As for the \"when doctors make mistakes, people die\" line, the writers were obviously LAMPOONING that, as it got repeated on a soap opera that some characters were watching on T.V. So maybe the whole show was just a tad too intellectually challenging for that reviewer--and/or maybe he missed that bit running to the kitchen for a snack, and so didn't get the joke.I thought it was quite interesting, relatively original (imagine that, in a world of \"reality\" shows!), and LOTS of fun--a show about hunting for diagnostic \"zebras.\" I could definitely be fascinated on a regular basis by medical mysteries (assuming the writing stays SHARP and accurate). I suppose, though, it may not survive long, if there aren't very many people who WANT to be entertained by being stimulated to think. Or worse, the producers may listen to the \"not exciting enough\" complaints like this and then just decide to try to clone ER (and of course, not possibly actually succeed, leading to a premature death, like poor Dolly the sheep and all such clones. . . . ).Anyway, if you like a medical MYSTERY (as distinguished from, let's say, a medical THRILLER/ACTION-ADVENTURE, which genre ER already indisputably reigns over), this ought to be JUST your \"cup of tea!\"",

There are no nurses, etc--instead our good doctors do everything themselves, including spending valuable time trying to take blood or finding a lost patient. Right. As others have pointed out the episodes are severely formulaic. There are two facets to each story: 1. Fixing mystery illness 2. Bickering with each other/ sexual tension/ House's addiction, lack of sentimentality, or the ironic contrast between his skill as a doctor and his lack of empathy. The plots all go this way: 1. Scene with patient becoming ill. 2. Opening theme 3. House and etc arguing rapidly about patient's conditions; House snaps witty remarks but they settle somewhat on a hypothesis. 4. Hypothetical diagnosis wrong, patient is worsening. 5. Another diagnosis with some more doctor/doctor bickering, and some revelation on part of House's character (he still has a heart, he has lots of pain, etc). 6. Diagnosis brings patient near to death, something must be done, but what?! 7. House gets some clue, and sends junior doctor to patient's home or interrogates family member. Family member cries and/or gets angry /something radical found at home. Risky diagnosis discovered by confident House, but could be win all/lose all 8. Patient is cured. End with showing some part of House's personality (addiction, lack of sentiment, inner anguish, etc).The initial exposure to Dr. House's personality as a Sherlock Holmsey type of vicodin-addicted character is amusing. While Holmes was usually cold, House is sardonic, unsocial and bitter, and uses sarcastic humour. He also uses dark humour to deflect his interior character, which is supposed have some pain and some loneliness to give his character interest. However, after the umpteenth acrimonious but witty reply, and the umpteenth little scene showing that he isn't completely unpleasant just gets eyerollingly boring.This is how the majority of episodes play out. Once in a while it's good if you've forgotten how the last episode played out, but I found that watching this show on a regular basis just feels like a huge waste of time.",

Nowadays there's usually not that much in the way of mystery shows on (US) TV anymore--cop shows, sure, but mysteries? And while ER is certainly a quality show, I never really cared that much for it either--too much like a daytime soap but with blood. \"House,\" however, seems a nice combo of medicine, mystery, and character. Hugh Laurie's Dr. House is someone you feel guilty loving because he's so arrogant and callous, but he keeps you entertained because you can't wait to hear what he'll say next. House loves to tell the truth as he sees it, cutting through the nice happy lies that your average urban US adult tells and believes, never mind the hurt feelings he might leave lying bleeding by the roadside. But of course, his character *may* hide a heart of gold, so in the end he's trying to do the right thing. Sure, it's a formula, and House is even a stock character maybe, but it works.If the creators/writers are smart, they'll allow a little character development, especially amongst the excellent supporting cast, but not ruin it by changing House or allowing him a romance with either of his female costars. Keep that sexual tension going!For fun, catch Hugh Laurie--who is British by the way--sometime on one of the seasons of Black Adder (usually rebroadcast on PBS, but also available at better video rental shops). He plays a complete idiot and is as convincing in that role as he is as the brilliant and misanthropic Dr. House. . .",

Besides his role in the film \"Peter's Friends\", I mainly knew his work from his comedy roles in \"Blackadder\" and \"Jeeves and Wooster\". Now, having seen him in \"House\", I find that he's a fine dramatic actor, as well. From previous reviews, you'll have read that Laurie plays Dr. House, an ill-tempered, disabled yet brilliant physician who doesn't like patients, but is challenged by unusual ailments. Aided by a small team of younger doctors, he tries to figure out a correct diagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, he also must deal with patients that he is forced to see in the hospital's walk-in clinic. As noted, Laurie's performance is very good; the early talk about an Emmy nomination for him is quite justified. The rest of the cast is also good, though the scripts have yet to fully examine each character. (Viewers may remember Omar Epps from his earlier medical role as the ill-fated Gant on \"ER\".) The stories, while set up as brain-teasers, are also refreshingly complex about the doctors, the patients and the hospital; they don't resort to the done-to-death \"HMO's are the source of all evil\" plot line. These doctors are brilliant, but not perfect; mistakes are made. In the end, I hope that Fox will allow the show to continue. It's good to see an interesting medical show on TV, now that \"ER\" has degenerated into a \"tragedy of the week\" soap opera. And, as for Hugh Laurie's accent, I've heard better, but I've heard a lot worse. Give him time. (In a recent episode, he got to use his native English accent for a joke.) One important note: \"House\" is not for the squeamish. There are some pretty graphic and disturbing scenes in the series that some viewers may find upsetting.

I did not know what was happening to the characters at the point in the story, but the acting was fantastic. The atmosphere was superb. The complexity of Dr. Gregory House intrigued me. I saw him as a tragic hero (something you find in works of literature) and his tragic flaw was his leg. Not only the physical limitations brought on by his leg, but the mental ones as well. The pain he suffers day by day that lead him to be the man he is. You see House as an ass...but you feel for him, because you know why he's an ass. Also, Hugh Laurie does such a good job with his accent, if I had not watched \"A Bit of Fry and Laurie\", I probably never would have guessed Hugh was British.\"House\" is like a beautiful novel.

He's a good doctor because the nurses respect him, his staff respects him. No, this is just a typical hospital story set in some land where doctors only care about making themselves look good in their own eyes.If the TV networks think they have created a true representation of the medical community in which there was a doctor like this one he would be on the street or better yet in jail, wasting their life telling everyone how good he was. Would someone really want to be treated by someone taking drugs to reduce their personal pain, not caring about the one thing they have promised to do. Would you want to trust someone who takes drugs on film for a living. Yes, that is what the networks think we want to see. The TV network wants us to think this is somehow real.I would rather be treated by Marcus Welby from the 1970's with no advanced technology than by a truly uncaring and totally disconnected person.

I myself was mistreated for a condition by a doctor who did not want to take the time to perform any tests because of HMO issues.I do understand that the actor portraying Dr. House is well paid (in excess of $50,000 per episode) to act in this manner and this is not a reflection on his moral standards, but it is a reflection on what he is willing to do for money. I would just like for the TV show to end in a real manner, with Dr. House and the entire staff being arrested and put in jail for life for the loss of their patients.

Not mentioning the rest of the crew, a sociopath (schizophrenic), a drug addict, and another muscle guy with no positive attribute.The smartest character, a boy (Joshua) is so smart that he failed to find help (his teacher tried to help him, his girlfriend's family could help him etc). Writers/ producers thought putting elements of crime, violence, sexy dudes and gals together can make a hit show, but this show is a complete screw up.The female characters don't even show their nipples, come on.",

If you haven't seen this incredible show yet and are looking for a show that will keep you on the edge of your seat every episode then stop what you're doing right now, do yourself a favor and go watch it...I promise you that you won't be disappointed!

It does this so gradually that you don't even realise it until realise you're watching some of the most beautifully-drawn characters on TV for a long time.It then becomes as much a character- study, and a character-driven drama - as it is an action-packed heist show. The issues, plotlines and brilliant twists and turns are consistently unpredictable and original.Some of the heists stretch credulity - as action sequences often do, but the whole thing is so skillfully-woven that it doesn't matter - you happily buy into the lack of believability in the heist/action sequences, because they're so well integrated into the brilliant character studies and first-class storytelling.The casting is perfect - everyone is bringing their A-game but Shawn Hatosy is astonishing and Ellen Barkin is hitting a career best.It's a Breaking Bad-level achievement, possibly exceeding it at times.

            "review": "I am in only mid season 3 so far, but having seen this show thus far I felt it necessary to leave a review, especially after seeing the many inexplicable 10 ratings which mention Point Break and High Octane.Animal Kingdom may be many things, but fast paces and high octane it is not. No, this is much more a rather slow burner of a drama with only tidbits of crime and action thrown in almost as if an afterthought. The show doesn't build around the crimes and jobs the Cody's commit and so far every single one of them has been pretty underwhelming. The viewer is show the highlights of the job, and there is very little victory or celebration to be felt even after the most successful heists because too much happens off screen. The action here is best filed under how to make robbery boring. The heists themselves are pretty ingenious, but the execution is just rather meh look we got more money. Give me the money. No we have to clean it first. Gets a little old.Where Animal Kingdom gets it right, like other great crime-dramas of the past is that there are no heroes. Every character is shown, the good, bad, the ugly, warts and all. Character development and back story are pretty limited leaving the viewer at a loss most of the time. Even the family tree isn't fully painted to the point that there is no clear vision of who fits where or why. Even the relation between characters is not well defined. In a way, it adds more intrigue, but it can also make it hard to follow at first. The only real thing that can be said is that the Cody family are mostly made up of some pretty horrible people, all very deserving of whatever bad karma may be thrown at them next. It is difficult at times to find even a single person to root for here.Still the show does have many positives. It is filmed in beautiful Oceanside, California and there are great scenes of the Strand, the Oceanside Pier and other locations throughout the city. As former resident, I loved how the characters talk about how real estate is ruining the beachfront because that is a war that has been raging since the mid 1980s. Some great surfing and other water sport scenes are peppered in as well, and the characters love traveling on a whim to Baja, either winding up in TJ or a bit further down south with mixed results.At this point there have been some pretty good episodes, but also a lot of dull, slow episodes also. There is a hope that the show will reveal a little more each time, that I think is the main reason to keep watching here. Every time the Cody's do something dirty and you think you've seen their worst, you need to wait as they'll even do something more despicable later on. The reason to keep watching is the hope that this strange ride has a destination or a point somewhere.As many times as I've been tempted to shut it off, I plan to soldier on through season 4 and hopefully 5 with the rest of you out there. Though often unlikable there is something about these Cody's that is down right addictive. If I had to compare this to anything it would not be anywhere close to Point Break. No, this has much more in common with Shameless.",

            "review": "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit is one of the best and most underrated shows on TV. It stars Christopher Meloni as Elliot Stabler, a tough-as-nails detective who makes his hatred of pedophiles and child molesters well known many times throughout the show. He has another side, a vicious side, that Criminal Intent's Robert Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) lacks. I'm very pleased that he's been nominated for an Emmy. Mariska Hargitay won an Emmy for her performance as Olivia Benson, another fantastic detective. Benson has more edge than CI's Alex Eames (Kathrine Erbe), but is revered for her ability to communicate to troubled witnesses and gouge confessions out of suspects. Her life is put in danger at least twice a season, yet she continues to be strong. Next is the sarcastic detective Jon Munch, played by the excellent comedian Richard Belzer. Munch may seem annoying at times, but his ability to relate to witnesses is excellent, and he plays the \"good cop, bad cop\" role very well. The final detective is Finn Tutuola, played by former rapper Ice-T. Ice-T plays the character reasonably well, but I think we'd all like to see a meaner side of him. He was very good in the episodes entitled \"Rage,\" and \"Rooftop\". They are led by Don Cragen, played by Dann Florek, and Cragen is as good a captain as any, as Florek reprises his role he held on \"Law & Order\" for a few years. Adam Beach recently joined the show, bringing something new to the table in youth and his almost 'surfer dude' approach to detective work. The ADA now is Casey Novak, played by Diane Neal, who could be better, but she gets the job done. She's been better of late, and the contrast between her and her predecessor is really helpful to the show. Her predecessor, Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) was great also. The team is also aided by an FBI psychiatrist, George Huang (BD Wong), who aids them in finding out the true horrors of a person, witness or suspect. His best performance was in the episode called \"Coerced.\" The members of this unit investigate sexually based crimes (rape, rape-homicide) and child based crimes (school shootings, child abuse, child molestation). The show has had extraordinary guest stars, from evil (Johnny Messner, Reg Flowers, Asio Highsmith, Jeff Kober) to touching (Leland Orser, Jerry Lewis) to lost (Brittany Snow) to famous and legendary actors (Jerry Lewis, Dean Cain, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Henry Winkler, Robin Williams, Matthew Modine, Alfred Molina, Cynthia Nixon, John Ritter). This is a truly great show that not only shows the line of work in this graphic department, but shows the emotional stress a detective goes through. 10/10",

I watched this show when it premiered back in 1999 and was impressed from the get go. Sure it followed the basic premise of it's original cousin but was much more loose on it's format and execution. Some episodes hardly ever involve the court room at all where the original week in week out follows a distinct pattern. First half hour is the law then the next is the order. This show although does sometimes follow the same pattern like i mentioned it is much more loose in how it executes it. Mariska Hartigay is excellent as her portrayal of Det. Olivia Benson. The whole cast as a whole is magnificent. Now I know a lot of people will disagree with me that this show is in no way better than the original but for me it is.

            "review": "When I am communicating with other people interested in crime series it is remarkable how many people seem to watch either CSI or CSI: Miami or both. Rarely (actually never) have I heard talk about this show, unless I brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them. Of course I do not know the situation in America and other countries regarding this show, but I feel it is very underrated in the Netherlands. Of course this has a lot to do with it's programming spot. While CSI is usually on Saturday's at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. and CSI: Miami on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., SVU's spot has been Sunday's around 11p.m. for quite some time now. That's hardly what I call a prime time spot. Just to compare I looked up the share's of those 3 shows on the internet. CSI has a share of 26 in the US and 17,5 in the Netherlands. For CSI:Miami these numbers are 15,0 and 13,2 and for SVU they are 17,0 and 7,7. This doesn't mean much, but once bring the number of households into it, it gets a lot clearer. CSI has about 18,6 million viewers in the US while CSI:Miami and SVU have 10,5 and 11,9 viewers respectively. In the Netherlands these figures are 1,175 million; 910 thousand and 370 thousand. This means that SVU has less than one-third of the viewers CSI has and MUCH less than half the viewers CSI: Miami has. In America SVU has two-thirds of the viewers of CSI and about 10% more than CSI:Miami. In my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot SVU has gained in the Netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two CSI's, for I feel it cannot have anything to do with it's quality.The thing that makes SVU stand out so much in opinion, is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt. I personally appreciate it very much, that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music. Mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short. Maybe that's just another 'trick' to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera's. TO me though, it makes the stories appeal much more life-like and truly gut-wrenching and sad.Also all of the characters are good. If you watch long enough, you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them, thus discovering what makes them tick. I must admit that the series has changes it's emphasis a bit in recent years. In the first year there were numerous episode's that featured theme's or events from the investigator's home environment (especially Stabler's). This trend has somewhat diminished over the years, yet you can still see each individual's background shining through into their work ethics. One thin I really had to get used to was Richard Belzer's (Det. John Munch) role getting smaller. It seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks, something I really enjoyed. But overall the series has not changed for the worse, for I feel it has actually improved. While a few years ago I'd given this series an 8 out of 10 I'm much more inclined now to rate it even higher. What I've come to appreciate these last 2 or three years, were the additions of Ice-T (Det. Fin Tutuola), B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang) and Stephanie March (A.D.A. Alex Cabbot) to the team. Stephanie March's character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the D.A's job is, but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice. Huang's intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone (up until now). Not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight, but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media's depiction of profilers in The Silence of the Lambs or the TV-series Profiler. Also I think it is good (in addition to being very interesting) to show the public that not every offender is purely bad, but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface. As for Ice-T's character, I think he really completes the mix in the show, as the tough street cop. Him and Belzer are an ideal couple, just like Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni).The reasons, I personally feel SVU is the best crime series on the tube at the moment, are easily summarized. It has very much diversity, it offers insight into the psyche's of both victim's and perpetrators and it is realistic in every aspect.9 out of 10",

            "review": "Around 2000, Law & Order had become one of the longest-running television shows based on a fictional premise, although it still has a long way to go in order to catch up with the record holders. Such was the continued popularity of the series that creator Dick Wolf saw a market for a spin-off, and was obviously glad to oblige. Hence, over ten years after Law & Order burst onto the airwaves, Special Victims Unit was born, so to speak.Of course, the show had a little problem finding its feet at first. This is only natural, even for a series spun off from a successful formula. The challenges Special Victims Unit faced included a major deviation from the normal Law & Order structure. The segment dealing with the trials of suspects was dispensed with, emphasising for the most part the efforts of the detectives to bring victims a sense of justice. As the series progressed, work with a District Attorney began to find its way into the plots, but in a manner more complementary to the work of the detectives.As in any series, the key ingredient is finding sympathetic leads that the audience can relate to. Where the original Law & Order eventually found solid ground in the form of Jerry Orbach, Special Victims Unit more or less got this element right from the start. Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni play so well off one another that it is certainly going to make life difficult for the unlucky actors who get to replace them. Another side benefit of the reduction in emphasis on the legal dealings is that we get to see more of the personal lives of the detectives, without them necessarily having to be worked into the plot. Every now and again, insight into the impact the job has on Stabler's family life in particular is offered, and it works wonderfully.The fundamental weakness in Special Victims Unit to date has been the supporting cast. Richard Belzer's schtick can get tiring, but adds the ironic comic touch (delivered so brilliantly by Orbach in the original series), which Meloni seems incapable of delivering. One has to wonder, however, whose bright idea it was to cast Ice-T as a replacement for one of the early detectives, as no matter how hard he tries to sound the part, one cannot believe him as a detective. Especially not one in this particular squad. The relative underdevelopment of most of the support characters does not help.Another challenge faced with every episode of Law & Order in any form is to come up with cases interesting enough to grab the attention. The original series is faltering slightly on this score, but when it does succeed, it succeeds enough to more than make up for all the average stories. Special Victims Unit, on the other hand, sets a consistent level for each episode. Because of the extreme nature of the crimes being investigated, they each become alike for the most part. It is the little details that make the big difference. This is, of course, a much better deal than the other spin-off, where the stories are consistent in how uninteresting they are.In all, Special Victims Unit is a well worthy follow-up to the original Law & Order. It is not recommended for sensitive viewers, but as an insight into the lot of those who have to clean up the mess in one of the modern world's most sexually violent societies, it works brilliantly. It even has potential to get better.",

It tackles some pretty intersting sides of society and humanity within an hour. I've been watching it for awhile and fell in love with the cast. They all have that hard edge that comes from doing a job like their's. Marishka is great and Ice-T is amusing. The storylines are very interesting and groundbreaking. In my classes, I've heard about the Down-Low phenomenon amongst black males in the U.S. This is the first show, aside from Oprah, that dealt with this issue. I was amazed and pleased that they'll take on any topic within their framework. Their guest cast should be praised as well. They have a great casting director. I don't know about their history with Emmy nominations, but they should definitely be in the running. The show has a very easy going nature despite the hardness of the cast that works well and acted beautifully.  It gives a real look at society's imperfections and discriminatory ideologies. Nobody on the show is perfect and even the lawyers manipulate the law beyond the usual scope people think they do. Instead, they are manipulating it to see justice done and not avoided. I would urge anyone to watch this show. Give it a look.",

            "review": "Although this started out as a promising show, a better title for what it quickly became would be \"Law & Order: Liberal Lecture Hour\". Each episode of the show is a transparent allegory or a direct presentation of some liberal crusade in which the dialogue completely focuses on the detectives, lawyers, clerks, victims, and random passers-by reciting some left-wing diatribe. At first they had the decency to at least include a cardboard cut-out of a figure to respond to these arguments. Now they don't even bother with that; it's a straight lecture, complete with occasional raps on the knuckles with a ruler for not caring as much as these fictional characters obviously do.Many times the stories won't even involve 'special victims'. The writer might throw in some crime that at first appears to be under their jurisdiction, but this will quickly be discovered to be false. Yet the detectives just care so much (and so should you!) about the tenuously tangential political/social issue that they are compelled to make it their crusade. And laughably they are always able to secure some meaningless, fictional victory over it by the end of the show.If that's not enough to drive you away, there's one other major problem with this series: the completely overbearing and ridiculous way the show worships Mariska Hargitay. Not only is her character completely preposterous - she has, in turn, been a cop, a detective, a computer crimes investigator/hacker, an undercover agent with the FBI (while making sure not to insult the hippies she's spying on, and making a point about police brutality), and so on - but also has an overbearing, sanctimonious back story and has to be told she's \"beautiful\" every third show. It becomes really preposterous when she decides to take one of her many vacations; while she's gone the show does nothing but mourn her absence, complete with shoulders-up close-up static scenes of her randomly inserted into stories so we won't go into deep withdrawal.Chris Meloni doesn't fare very well in a role that has been almost entirely phased out. He was originally the 'muscle', but left-wingers don't like muscle, so now he's morphed into kind of a touchy-feely, whiny crybaby who pines for his cardboard cut-out of a wife and family and apparently feels bad for being the necessary tough guy. His role is unintentionally hilarious because the makers of the show have no idea what to do with him. They want a tough guy so people who like cop shows will watch (because enforcing the law requires tough guys), but if they make him too tough they'll lose the left-wing audience who likes the sermons and thinks violence is icky. So one show he'll punch a guy, and the next show he's in therapy for it. There's an episode where he takes down a combative perp using a choke hold - the only action sequence in the show - and is then castigated for the rest of the episode for 'excessive force'. On the ridiculous 'Abu Ghraib' episode they had him utter the completely laughable lie that he had \"used force\" to compel a confession, but \"9 times out of 10 is was counterproductive\". Makes one long for the halcyon days of Andy Sipowicz.The rest of the cast are increasingly irrelevant, pencil-sketch background characters. Though there have been abortive attempts to flesh some of them out, they're almost entirely ignored except to occasionally throw in a line representing their one dimension of characterization. Is there a pimp in this story? Bring in Ice-T! Does anybody use the word 'conspiracy' in this one? Bring in Belzer! And there's usually not much courtroom drama in an episode - the cops generally browbeat the audience for at least 45 minutes, minus the occasional chase scene - so we generally only see the pretty ADA give her speech. Which always reflects the lecture we've been given all episode and comes to the obvious conclusion: everybody who doesn't agree with the left-wing point of view on the issue is evil and should be in prison. But not executed! They're against that.So basically if you want to worship at the temple of Hargitay, believe everything sent to you in an email by MoveOn.org and love the Daily Show, and think the best entertainment is to hear your own opinion regurgitated to you based upon the latest opinion poll, this is your show. If you think Hargitay looks a little mannish, actually want to see a good cops/lawyers show, or find trite presentations of important issues tiresome, there's better to be found.",

But people are willing to overlook such things on TV in the interests of fantasy. I am too. What's depressing is that people are willing to overlook the lousiness of the production in the interests of what they're really getting out of the show: the chance to watch the hounds chase the fox for an hour, until the latter collapses of exhaustion.What's also depressing is that this show is part of a trend. In the past, a leading-up-to-the-trial kind of TV show would have focused on the defence lawyers; it's a shame that we're now getting a kick out of siding with the prosecution, especially when it's this bunch of deeply unpleasant people.Perry Mason didn't have a mean streak.",

The lead character River does a decent job of keeping us entertained and in a show with everyone having character flaws they are quite adept at revealing them in creative ways.The overall story isn't all that exciting, but the actors do their best with what's on the script. It's not as action heavy as the Condor series but good enough to keep watching for now.After making it to eps 3, it's gotten progressively worse since the pilot. Orig rating was a 6, now a 4 and I'm done. Lots of mumbling and bumbling around by two different departments. Nobody wants to see Gary Oldman being a complete ass over and over. The initial 5 minutes in the pilot, all action, is very misleading now as it's all a long drawn out story with little if any action at all.I really wanted to like this, but there's nothing there to like.

The tension is there, and you are a bit on the edge of your seat wondering where this is going. But then, half way past episode 3, you really start to notice that this plot is absolutely improbable.When i was done with episode 4, i was shaking my head in disbelief, and after episode 5 i was almost puking. This show makes every mistake known to man, except actually putting \"academy award winner Gary Oldman\" on the poster.The script is terrible, the characters are stereotypical, the plot completely off rails, the story is predictable and lazy, the editing is uninspired, the directing is completely by the book.By episode 5, Oldman is trying his best to keep his character plausible and relevant in this rather impossible plot, but you can clearly see he isn't up for the task, and that's saying something, when we are talking about one of the greatest character actors that has ever lived.I really wished this show was great, but instead it's simply bad. Two first episodes felt like a 7/10, it wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either, it was good, and i hoped it with start to climb as the plot thickened. But instead it all falls apart and goes downhill with impossible plot twists, bad writing, countless clichés , and the show just tumbles over the edge and gains momentum into the abyss.The writers of this show thought that creating an endless amount of coincidences could make their story plausible, they were wrong.3/10 - Bad.",

The series narrative makes as much sense as a show about the Mormons secretly being an international drug smuggling operation.

I'll watch it for the sake of enjoyment and passing the time. I'm not expecting it to be an Emmy-worthy series.",

Never expected to care for it as not a particular fan of period K-Drama but what caught my attention was that the theme of cooking. Put it on just to see if I should keep it on my list and got hooked! The 2 main leads are fantastic in their rolls - the young King, handsome, stern but yet funny with his cute but devilish smirks; the modern day chef perfect at humiliating him.

We expected to see something similar to the French films The Taste of Things with Juliette Binoche and Benoit Magimel. This film started out fine at a gourmet cooking competition but then went crazy. Traveling in time could be accepted as a creativity but the whole script was so childish, so stupid that it was hard to watch. My husband gave up, I continued until the end of the first episode. There was some cooking at the end but nothing as I expected. There are many good films based on gastronomy and cooking but this isn't one of them. I can't understand the high grades that people have. Maybe the film is for a teenage audience. It definitely wasn't for us.",

Im Yoon-ah is incredible here; she completely lights up the screen as Yeon Ji-yeong. Her character is funny, smart, and so easy to root for. And the chemistry with Lee Chae-min? Off the charts. Every scene they share feels electric, whether they're bickering, cooking, or slowly letting their guard down.I also adore how the story is structured around food. Each episode feels like a full-course meal-there's drama, sweetness, spice, and always something that makes you hungry. The supporting cast adds so much flavor too, from the scheming nobles to the people in the palace kitchen.Sure, it's a little over-the-top sometimes, but that's part of its charm. I came here for a fun drama, and I got way more than that. It made me laugh, it made me swoon, and it honestly left me wanting a second season already.If you're looking for something unique and heartwarming with a dash of fantasy, Bon Appétit, Your Majesty is a must-watch.",

The chemistry between the leads is nothing short of magical. Despite their age difference, they look so comfortable together that the screen almost forgets to separate fiction from reality.What makes this drama stand out is the effortless and natural connection the leads share. Their interactions feel genuine, filled with warmth and tenderness that go beyond scripted lines. Every smile, every glance, and every subtle gesture seems unforced, as if they were truly made for each other. It's the kind of chemistry that cannot be faked-it flows naturally, pulling the audience into their world.Episode 4 delivered what I can confidently call the best kiss I have ever seen in K-drama history. The scene was breathtakingly raw, capturing emotions that felt so real, I found myself wondering if I was watching the characters or witnessing the actors themselves caught in a genuine moment. The direction, camera work, and most importantly, the emotional depth of the leads, made this scene unforgettable. It wasn't just a kiss-it was an expression of unspoken love, vulnerability, and longing.Both actors deserve immense praise for how naturally they portray their roles. Their performances prove that true chemistry doesn't come from age similarity, but from trust, comfort, and emotional authenticity. Watching them together is a joy, and it leaves me wanting more with every episode.If anything, I only wish this series had more than 12 episodes-or even a second season-so we could continue to witness this beautiful story unfold. Until then, I'll be cherishing every moment that Bon Appétit, Your Majesty has given us.",

Some writers really fumble the initial steps of character development and your in the dark wondering who, how & why, but here the writers succeeded in developing their essence and backstory while moving the initial plotlines along handily.The comedy was impressively pulled off especially by Yoon A. Every past criticism of being a beautiful Kpop artist with sub par acting holds no water here: physical and verbal comedy are both carried out with aplomb. The Emperor proves to be a handy foil until he finally gets his teeth and even then we feel for the fact underneath he is still a bit perplexed.For those not familiar with Korean history it is true that a bit of the time period is confusing initially but as the 2nd episode progressed most was explained satisfactorily without causing the plot to drift sideways.We also are teased with just enough foreshadowing to have a glimpse of some of the mayhem on its way, and it looks to be delicious!There are tropes galore: a staple of kdrama. Well executed instead of cringe. Just because the kdrama favorite trope of time travel has again been utilized does not detract this time, thankfully.If they can keep the momentum up for all twelve episodes Bon Appetite Your Majesty is going to a majestic ride and we will be thrilled.The audience viewing numbers tell the tale even if one feels a singular review may be s suspect. The show picked up an impressive increase from Ep 1 to Ep 2 after the word of mouth circulated about the quality of the first episode. Boosting it to #3 Worldwide and #1 non english series in 89 countries on Netflix. Are tens of millions that much out to lunch? I think not in this case.",

It was longer than expected, which was a shock. That's what she said.It felt like they just gathered all the information on how the paper industry works and showed it off, forgetting it was supposed to be a comedy show. And why is Oscar showing so much attitude? He was just a normal side character, and out of everyone, he's the one who returned. Now he's acting like he doesn't even want to be filmed. How does that make sense? If you don't want to do it, then don't come. That's what she said.I liked Domhnall in The Patient and Sabrina in The White Lotus, so I was excited to see them here, but they can't do much if the writing isn't funny. Other than them, Ramona (Nicole) was a standout. The others were okay but never exciting. That's what she said.To top it off, they're so confident they renewed it for a second season before even releasing the first episode. They're basically like, \"Let's do it again. Maybe next time will be better.\" That's what she said.In the American version of The Office, there was a very likeable boss, Michael, the annoying HR guy Toby, romantic tension between Jim and Pam, and the pranks Jim played on Dwight. All that stuff is still so memorable. Even after years, I'll never forget it. That's what she said.Honestly, I want to watch the remaining episodes because of the strong cast, but I don't think I'll be able to because of the writing.

Why not just make a new show?The color palette is ugly and dull, the acting ranges from bad to passable, the writing is pedestrian. The shoehorning in of the Miami metro characters (Masuka, Angel, LaGuerta) is just obnoxious fan service and ultimately is what makes it unwatchable for me. Honestly, I thought most of the supporting characters were generally pretty weak and unnecessary in the original series, so I find it particularly egregious that they appear in the prequel.I gave it a chance and watched the first 4 episodes and will not continue.

Part of Hall's original that was so good was that he was not at all imposing but yet was the most dangerous killer around.

Just the way it looked and was shot was very cool but this doesn't even look like Miami. It comes off as a low budget imitation.

The beginning of the first episode was cringey with the edits and the CGI cop car, and I thought \"oh boy, this is going to flop\". By the end of the first episode, I was eating crow, as the actors embodied their characters perfectly and the story showed immense promise.While we know much of the backstory already, the first episode held a couple of surprises that add to the depth of some of the characters we've grown to know and love, and adds some background into the decisions made by those characters. Only one episode in and I'm hooked already!",

Dexter (seasons 1-8) is the only series I rewatch all the time.Like Harry (according to Dexter), change is not easy for me.So when Dexter: New Blood came out, at first the change of scenery, the cold, the absence of some beloved cast members and the lack of humour and latin music were a huge disappointment to me. However, after watching it as a standalone show (with no comparisons to the original), it grew on me.Now, with this new show, of course we're not used to the new faces in the cast. We all remember the young Dexter, Deb and Harry to look different, even Laura Moser.However, I think it may be unfair to judge the casting as we're not in the shoes of the casting directors and producers. I believe they had to consider many aspects besides just similar looks.Yes, we all wish that Michael C. Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, James Remar and the rest of the original cast could magically play the younger versions of their own characters, but time only goes one way. (Bonus: I really like Christian Slater. He's awesome as always!)So far, after watching the first episode twice, I like it. I think everyone did a pretty decent job filling in those big Dexter shoes.I cannot deny, actually, the fact that I'm now even more excited to watch Dexter: Resurrection after getting a glimpse of Dexter being revived in the emergency room.In short, I think this show is cool and will probably grow on me even more with time.If you're a Dexter fan, go in with no specific expectations or judgment.

They are caricatures of their original series counter parts, but they are there. You have Muppet Baby Masuka, Muppet Baby Batista, we are told to expect Muppet Baby LaGuerta. All look and act and behave exactly like the older versions of their characters from the original series, only younger. They dress the same. They act the same. Have the same mannerisms. As if they did not grow into the characters that we know and love.The prequel that I wanted, as a fan of the original series, was to see Harry DISCOVERING Dexter's \"dark passenger\", and how they need to keep that from Debra and how \"the code\" came to be. I wanted to see an adolescent Dexter navigating high school and growing into the man that we came to love from the original.And so the \"Muppet Babies\" gang really shouldn't have even been in the show, except for maybe some nostalgic nods via occasional guest appearances as coworkers of Harry who show up to pay fan service now and again.Instead, we get to see a reenactment of Dexter's first kill. Which we've already seen. That was in the original show, we didn't need to see it again.And where it leaves us at the end, tells us to expect that this show is going to be more of a \"reboot\" than a prequel. It's going to show Dexter in the Miami PD, with the same characters surrounding him as the original series.In other words, we can expect to see a show that we've basically already seen. The only difference is that Harry is still alive. But if you've seen the original, this is going to be exactly the same show only with the characters being slightly younger. Which is why I'm calling this \"Muppet Babies Dexter\" ... because that's what it is.",

Patrick Gibson and Christian Slater are at least doing their own thing with their characters but those playing Deb, Angel and Masuka are almost unintentionally comical.At this point the Dexter series has provided more bad than good and if this ends up being decent I'm not surprised long time fans will say it's great.

The original had more than enough flashbacks to basically cover that. So we've seen it all before. Christian Slater is horribly miscast as the father. Harry in the original show was a straight-laced, serious cop. Christian Slater is nothing like him. So it immediately takes you out of the show. The actor playing Dexter is trying way too hard and it's kind of weird. Younger versions of Matsuka and the other police officers is where I just checked out.

Starting at the top with Mark Harmon, the sexiest man on TV-he also sets the tone with his right on portrayal of the most conflicted man on TV today! His obsession with Ari (the terrorist), his list of rules, then his tendency to think out of the box just adds to the spice and pace of this show.

His stories are hysterical, then his sad commentary on the life or death of their latest subject-just gives you pause. His diatribe on the terrorist and what he did to his assistant alone is Emmy award stuff-don't mess with Ducky ever again!

I have to disagree as to the chemistry with Gibbs/Kate-it's there all right-hopefully we get to see something come of it in Season 2!

The writers (at least to me) were able to pull off the \"suspended disbelief\" and I got pulled into the moment as DiNozzo was about to kick the bucket. I sure hope they keep most of the cast in the next season, as they seem to play off each other brilliantly. The only cast member I could see losing (according to the season finale preview, they lose an NCIS agent) is McGee. He's great and believable for his role, but any of the others lost as regulars on the show would break down the core character interplay. The McGee character could be replaced...but the others would be much more difficult. But then again I guess this is all decided and in the can...we'll find out on May 24th. My comments to other viewers that have commented on the reality of the series --- yeah, it's not the real life NCIS at all. But real life would be mind-numbingly boring to fit in 60 minute TV show.

The only one one who is half decent is Dinozzo simply because he has no special character traits. Everyone else is a stereotype of a character that has been done to death in a million other shows. I just find that basically none of the characters interact well with one another. It is as if they took the main characters from their own shows and dropped them all together in NCIS. The result is that they are all too unique to create any kind of cohesion. Maybe once a show Dinozzo and Gibbs have a funny sequence of lines but every other time it is not funny and usually nonsensical, defying the way any humans would interact with each other. Not to mention countless instances of assault on the part of Gibbs towards his team, and the team in general towards suspects,terrorists etc. It all adds to the stupidity and unbelievability.

Also there isn't too much on Australian TV on a Tuesday night! I soon realised that nothing was going to improve. The programme just has nothing innovative about it. I think the characters are wasted with very pointless clichéd story lines that wind up far too quickly and conveniently at the end. I don't think the writers are even trying. How did this programme have 4 series?!Don't bother watching it!",

I stopped watching the series short time after that. For some reason I watched a few episodes of season 15. This serial has become so lame, it is really unbelievable. From a franchise wich used to be fun, action and drama, we now just see lame attempts of a script trying to make people cry, laughing my ass off. The actors are so unconvincing and having actors crying on screen or looking like they are going to cry any minute doesn't make it more watchable, it is just annoying and painfull to watch, what a waste of time and resources. Still the best is putting Gibbs next to a child and have him smile, it's so creepy! Gibbs I think you made enough of money, stop it and invest in another project, not involving children or ctying actors, it is defenitly not your thing.",

In episode 1 we think we get a good feel for the main fire investigator and his family, but in episode 2, one scene totally shakes that all up. It comes completely out of left field and kind of makes the viewer feel that most of these characters are bi-polar and manic, because they do complete 180's from what we saw in episode 1. I'm also a huge fan of mysteries and I believe the best shows are the ones where you try and figure out who the villain is along with the main characters. Well, that doesn't happen here, because both arsonists are revealed by the end of episode 2. It takes all the fun out of the show. Instead of building up the reveal, they show way too much, way, way too early and it made me completely lose interest in the story.

The opening music sets the tone for the upcoming program. In this case, ouch. Seems the tone they want to set is one of slow, mournful, drudgery which lacks any excitement or sense of life itself. Basically depression in music form. I think they read the lyrics (read, not listened to) and failed to see the big picture for the title song.After watching the first 2 episodes.. yeah opening sequence setting the tone may be fitting. Drudgery.There's so, so, so much backstory for the detective (Smollett) in the first two episodes. Contrasted heavily by only one \"flashback\" of one setting for the fire investigator (Egerton). This striking difference did not go unnoticed.I won't include any spoilers, but the \"reveal\" at the end of episode two wasn't really as shocking as I think it was meant to be.There are aspects of the two main characters that just seem, well, B-movie-esk. Like they are so over-the-top, uhm, odd or ridiculous - for lack of a better phrase - that they just throw suspension of disbelief out the window at times.Not a great start.---------------------------Episode 3 confirmed my initial assessment... it's a \"nothing show\". Trying so hard to be \"deep and meaningful\" but it falls terribly short.Not watching any more. There's no point.-----------------------Broke down and watched the last of it. (at double speed because it's so slow). It does pick up a bit at episode 6.. and the last 3 episodes of the season are better.But I gotta say.. I was rolling on the floor with laughter at the \"big reveal\" for the season (presumable series) finale. It was HILARIOUS that \"that\" was the thing producers/writers thought would be so stunning it'd wrap up everything well.Still ABSOLUTELY no backstory in all 9 episodes for the Fire Inspector (Edgerton).. none.. zero.. zilch... really. No clarity in his his story whatsoever... just bad writing.Still deserving of the original 3 stars after seeing the full season.",

This isn't just \"good\" - it's really, really, really good. It should be at least in the high 8s.Jurnee Smollett is effortlessly cool, magnetic, and somehow pulls you onto her side from the very first episode. She plays it with such quiet strength and instinct that you end up fully rooting for her, even when you're not sure you should be. It's subtle and confident work.Taron Egerton, on the other hand, is an absolute monster - and it's incredible. You hate him, but you can't stop watching. The performance is full of control, power, delusion, and pure ego - and it's real. It's so real, it's disgusting. And brilliant.But what makes Smoke shine is what it dares to explore: rejection, control, abandonment, shame, manipulation, the need to be seen, the chaos that comes when people with deep damage try to navigate power - it's all here. And it's not spoon-fed or sanitised. It hits hard.So why the low rating?I think it's this: people either live such boring, surface-level lives that they can't understand the complex emotional depth of the characters in this - or they think it's \"unrealistic\" because they've never had to confront real trauma, real darkness, or real survival instincts. Smoke doesn't hold your hand. It doesn't care if you don't get it. And clearly, some viewers just... didn't.If you're after another formulaic hero/villain arc or something \"easy,\" go elsewhere.

Throw in some ball-busting babes in scanty attire to bring the guys back to earth and humble them even as they drool, and you've pushed most of the buttons the uncritical viewer requires to enjoy an hour of what is essentially a soap opera.Sorry to bust your bubble, fellas, but you go ahead and have fun.

            "review": "I went into Kimetsu no Yaiba with high expectations. After all of the hype surrounding it within the anime community, I expected it to blow me away. Sadly, it didn't, and ultimately, I walked away from Demon Slayer somewhat disappointed. This anime definitely had its good points; however, sloppy writing and hollow characters ended up bogging this anime down.Let's start with the good.The animation was stunning, and the soundtrack was great.Ufotable did an excellent job with the animation as usual. The fights flowed smoothly, with careful detail and excellent utilization of different shot types throughout different scenes. The color palate was diverse and vibrant, which benefited the character designs and certain scenes greatly. I didn't pay much attention to the soundtrack, but when I did notice, it reflected themes appropriately and often would amplify moods within different scenes.Additionally, the story is decent.Minus a few conveniences here and there, the story is well developed with a clear villain and end goal. The power structure is well constructed, and changes in powers are not easily attained.Where did it struggle though?Well firstly, the characters. Yeah, they're likable.... that's it. If that's enough for you then this gripe doesn't hold much weight, but if you fancy all-around well-written characters, I don't think you'll find them here. What you'll find instead are characters that seem to revolve around a certain trait/group of traits that define their character and leave no room for realistic depth.Tanjiro is a generic and 1-dimensional main character. Okay cool, his family died and his sister became a demon so he's searching to find a cure. Okay cool, he's compassionate and kind towards almost everyone. That's great and all, but those things still don't tell me enough about his personality and character; they never really further his character later either. It seems like the writer just wrote down a handful of good traits and said, \"Hey, that's good enough for a main character.\" They give him no real weaknesses other than his initial physical inferiority, which virtually makes him just as human as his demon sister. The fact that his character and actions throughout the story mostly revolve around other characters and events is a testament to how poorly established he is as a singular character.Zenitsu showed some promise during his initial introduction in the final selection arc and during the \"spider fight\" (I don't know what to call it) but ends up starting and finishing the same: a character for comedic relief, which would be fine if the satire in constantly screaming and complaining was actually funny to me.Inosuke is a loose cannon supporting character who doesn't have much to offer other than occasional comedic relief and utilization as another piece for fights.I really can't rip on Nezuko though; the writing mostly protects her character from criticism, and she's adorable.Speaking of the writing, it's not good. It's not awful, but it's not good. Honestly, it feels like this show was written for children. They constantly choose to tell instead of show or tell while showing. Nearly every action or emotion is either expressed through dialogue or inner monologue, which severely dampens the delivery of any emotional blow and makes the strong accompanying imagery practically superfluous.The dialogue also suffers severely from the lack of strong character foundation. It comes out awkward at times and mostly just serves to further the plot or to briefly check on the characters' states. The problem with the lack of revealing dialogue is the subsequent weak characters and character relationships. I can't even describe the primary character dynamics other than the words \"friendly\" and \"caring\"; there's nothing remotely notable about them other than maybe Inosuke calling Tanjiro \"Monjiro\" and Zenitsu's dependency on Tanjiro.In the end, Kimestsu no Yaiba succeeds on certain levels but also fails on others. I came in with expectations of a masterpiece but left with a feeling of pseudo-fulfillment. Maybe if I started with lower expectations I would have a more positive reception. Nonetheless, it still emerges at the top of its respective season of anime, and I would probably recommend it to friends if I wanted to introduce them to anime. 6/10 now please proceed to find this to be not helpful because you disagree with my opinion.TLDR: Great animation, nice music, cool fights, Interesting plot and setting. Flat characters, awful writing. Depending on how you weigh different aspects, you may enjoy this quite a bit. I recommend it.",

I know internalization is part and parcel of animes but goddamn the main character just won't shut up for a second.\n3. Above all, the anime has a mediocre and typical storyline. The main character sets out on a quest to find the cure for his sister. To this end he must fight demons, which is basically like every other shounen anime ever. That's it. There's nothing else to the story. No depth. No complexity. To make up for the lackluster storyline, the author just includes some fanservicing scenes with cute adorable characters.

On this journey he meet two other young demon slayer, which then accompaing him on his quest.Well, reading that you might see many pretty generic plotlines. Of course, that must not be bad per se. But the thing here is, that the characters are quite flat. Our young hero Tanjiro for example is really nice and friendly, thats it. He has no flaws, no errors. He has a tragic backstory, cries sometimes and must train more to become stronger... wow, never heard that before. Same goes for all the other characters and also for the world. Like the ranking system for the organization, it was just once mentioned. During the first season we only get to know members from the highest rank. What about all the other ranks? ( It would be like in One Piece during the first 100 episode we will only meet yonkos ). And to the style of the main characters: The main characters look so much out of place with the hair and the styling, compared to other people. And nobody is paying attention to that (not like in FMA were everybody is constantly looking at them)\nWhat really is amazing about the tv show is the animation and beautiful drawing. It is really top, watching the episode 19 season 1 was really amazing. Also the music is quite good. (But honestly, music and animation not as good as AOT - lets be real here).The tv show is okay to watch, it can be funny and interesting. Maybe younger audiences will love it more.

Ted Lasso doesn't have a cynical or sarcastic bone in his body, and viewers will very quickly be won over to his way of playing and living.I could have done without any of the jokes about how little he knows about football. Not many of them were funny and some were just annoying. Thankfully, these were few and evaporated quickly as the story got up on its own two legs and ran away from the original TV commercial gag.I just watched E07 last night and I couldn't even believe how badly I needed what Ted Lasso is selling.

The story is also well written and mile stones are set perfectly.\nIt's a feel good series and I think it's hard not to like after you get into it. I love it and can't get enough of it.",

            "review": "As with others, I'm utterly perplexed by the positive reviews. I appreciate that comedy is difficult to do well. To pull off a gag, as it were, requires careful timing, planning and construction - you could even say that jokes have their own syntax or a set of rules. I've studied scripts from the 1930s onwards, looking into the mechanics of being funny. I would also consider myself to have a great sense of humour, as well as a breadth and depth of knowledge about the history of comedy. I've laughed long and hard at everything from the Carry-on films, Python and Fawlty Towers in the 70s, Black Adder in the 80s, Father Ted in the 90s, and The Big Bang Theory....to name but a few. I have an enormous amount of respect for comedy writers. But this is dreadful, puerile, unfunny and deeply irritating nonsense. We are meant to laugh at the idea that the British like tea, for example. Any comedy writer with talent and imagination would dismiss this as having zero value - it is far, far too obvious. I sat through half an hour of this mediocrity without even smiling. No doubt there are countless other lame attempts at jokes but it isn't worth bothering remembering them. Utterly hopeless patronizing, brain-dead guff! Watch something genuinely funny instead. This tripe is guaranteed to insult your intelligence.",

            "review": "Looking at the IMDb reviews it seemed rather strange to me that most of them (the top ones at least) were quite outdated, written in 2005-2006 actually or the reviewers had not seen more than 50 or 100 episodes. Having said that please note that i have seen 610 episodes and 2 movies(strong world, film z) as of the day I'm writing this review. I hope my review will provide you with valuable insight to the series or even convince you to watch it. I will try to be as spoiler free as possible.It's been about a year since i started watching anime regularly and that is something I have yet to regret. I mostly enjoy short anime with less than 50 episodes that have good plot and well made characters, anime like cowboy bebop(my favorite), mushishi, ergo proxy, code geass etc. I knew about anime like OP, Naruto, Bleach even before I started watching anime but kept avoiding them even when I had seen about 50 (I must have seen over 100 now XD) other anime mainly because I thought to myself 'how can they be any good when they have that many episodes? Aren't they out of ideas yet?'. Well I might be right about Naruto and Bleach but when it comes to One Piece I couldn't be more wrong. One piece is so good, so enjoyable and it never ends which is something everyone who is watching it wants.Talk about long introduction huh? Anyways onto the actual review now. It will be divided into 4 sectors: story, characters, art and sound, enjoyment.STORY: Now the story at first might seem very simple and straightforward, a young boy Monkey D. Luffy (17 years old)setting out on sea on a great journey to become the Pirate King and find One Piece the biggest and greatest treasure in the OP world that was left in 'that' place by the former Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. Before Roger was executed publicly by the marines-world government he told everyone that if they wanted OP they had to look for it and that it was all left in 'that' place and that ignited the great age of pirates. The series is divided into arcs, each featuring its very own story and setting, each island, each place the straw hat pirates (Luffy and his crew) visit is a whole different adventure with new people to meet and new circumstances. And that's one of the best things of OP, you never get bored. You are fascinated by the huge and diverse OP world and you just can't let go of it. Everything is interesting and everything is fun, Luffy and his crew never chose the easy path but they strive for adventure and excitement and they almost pass their feelings to us the viewers. That's something very rare especially in anime and OP handles that expertly. Once you have seen enough episodes you will realize that the main characters of the series, especially Luffy, don't really care about their destination, hell most of the times they don't even know where they are going at all. All that matters is that they are going somewhere interesting where they will learn new things, get stronger, meet new people and face powerful foes. Another thing worth mentioning is that the series has very few fillers (episodes that did not exist in the original story-source material-manga) unlike some other mainstream anime series(Naruto, Bleach anyone?). Also the fillers are actually not that bad, sure they are not good but many of them are OK. And that's a huge plus for an anime series.CHARACTERS: This is where OP really shines. Each character is presented with great detail, they are all quite unique. Everyone has their own backstory explained thoroughly and we get to see why they are who they are, why each one of them has their very own ambitions and dreams. Due to their different experiences they have very different personalities and through good character development we see how they interact with each other and how they get closer to each other. We see how they become comrades and everyone is looking for each other, they become something very close to a family. That's the kind of bonds they make. Furthermore we not only see the history and personality of the straw hats but many others too like members of the marines. We see why they make the kind of choices they make. Nobody is entirely evil and nobody is purely good. Everyone has a good reason behind what they are doing and they strongly believe in their own cause, in their own justice and in their own dreams.ART AND SOUND: One Piece also excels in this sector with beautiful and vivid animation. The sceneries look alive and all different from each other with their very own characteristics. The characters are illustrated masterfully and each character looks a lot different from each other (that's a huge plus in anime). The sound department also did a great job especially with the voice actors, I'm always talking about the original Japanese (don't you dare see the English dub),who fit really well into their respective characters. The music, for me at least, is very catchy and actually really well made. However that depends on personal taste, if you are not really into this kind of karaoke-Japanese style of music you might not like it. Nevertheless OP really has some of the greatest music themes I have heard in an anime.OVERALL ENJOYMENT: One Piece is one of the most, if not the most enjoyable and diverse anime series you can find. It really excels in pretty much every field there is. It is the only anime series, or any series, I have seen with that many episodes and yet manages to stay that good(and believe me, have I seen a lot). I recommend OP to anyone with enough time and hunger for adventure. If you have not decided whether to watch it or not just watch 10 episodes and see for yourself if you want continue or not (oh you will want to continue). Trust me and you won't regret it, just like I did.And yep that's the end of it fellas. If you enjoyed my review and found it useful please upvote so others can see it.2021 update: I've been on the fence about deleting this since it's so poorly written, I was 17 at the time of writing and not a native speaker, and my opinion on one piece and anime in general has changed dramatically for the worse. But I figured I might as well leave it be since people seem to like it and it serves as a kind of snapshot of my 17 year old self whose input other hopeful 16 and 17 year adventurers out there might find helpful.",

But when he was captured he was sentenced to be executed. On the day he was executed he revealed his One Piece treasure is hidden somewhere at The Grand Line.This made people set sail and try to hunt down the One Piece treasure. Many have failed and never found the location of it. But over the years it's drawn attention and formations on hundreds of Pirate groups who seek the title of Pirate King. The whole world has entered the Golden Era of Pirates.On one island lived a boy named Luffy, who is friends with a pirate named Captain Shanks. He looks up to Shanks as a hero. And would do anything to be part of his crew. But he was too young to become a pirate or part of any crew. One day Luffy encountered the Devil Fruit. He ate it and obtain the power the fruit hold. It gave him the ability to stretch with a body made of rubber. But once you eat the Devil's Fruit, you're cursed with the powers forever. And can never be able to swim again. After almost drowning in the water, his friend Shanks saved his life. As Shanks departs with his crew, he gave Luffy his prized straw hat. He told him to keep it with him, until they meet again. While Luffy was left feeling sad but honored at the same time.

Throughout the series, he'll find new lands, new allies, treasure, danger, and plenty of villains to face off. But with some faith and the powers of the Devil's Fruit. Luffy will sure to succeed his goal in becoming the Greatest Pirate that ever lived.Comic made back in the late 90s, and the anime series has been around since the earlier days of SpongeBob. I first heard of it when it came on the FoxBox back in late 2004. I wasn't entirely into many anime back then. And I never saw the English Dub of the series, as I found it to be an OK series. After reading on the internet that the dub is heavily edited and nothing like the original. I grew interest on how good it is. I read the first volume of the Manga series. And liked how the story was going.Wasn't until January 2007, when I finally start to check out the Anime. Only I viewed the episodes that are subtitled, uncut, and uncensored. And I grew to love it. The animation is very well done, it's funny, it's action packed, and it's dramatic sometimes. I don't even consider it a kid's cartoon, when it's more aimed to teenagers. But with an interesting cast of characters, and over a hundred secondary/miscellaneous characters. One Piece is indeed a great Anime next to Case Closed, Naurto, & other ongoing series.The reason why it's very underrated was because of 4Kids being the first company to distribute the anime. Which they edited and censored a lot. And many flaws in the dubbing. Such as voices that don't suit the characters' personalities. Too many pirate accents and catch-phrases that get old instantly. All the violence, blood, alchol, drugs, and nudity were altered and removed. All the weapons were altered to look harmless. 4Kids spent more time edditting than spending time on the scripts. Plus a lot of filler and small episodes were removed. And most of them were too important to take out in the series.The good thing is 4kids no longer owns rights to One Piece. I knew they would drop it, because they did a poor job in introducing the series to English speaking countries.With over 300 episodes, I can tell that One Piece is really big in Japan. I've seen all the current episodes. And can't get enough of it.So those who like their Anime uncut, should highly recommend seeing One Piece uncut by fan subs or Funimation's release on the series.",

Well one day while watching Toonami in the UK i stumbled across show called one piece. It wasn't amazingly good, there were obvious problems with the dub, but it was enjoyable none the less. After i'd watched few episodes i started to become curious about the characters and the origins of the story. I did a little bit of research on the web and found out that the version of One Piece i was watching had been butchered from its original format. There were A lot of sources that all said the same thing, that the original One Piece was brilliant and that the dub was nothing in comparison. I liked the show and wanted to see what Uncut One Piece was like. After a little more searching i found some fantastic fansubs and my real One Piece experience started. What can i say, Japanese One Piece is one of the best stories ever told and is by far my favourite show to watch. I look forward everyweek to watching the next episode when the fansub is released. 280 episodes into the series and its still as great as it was when it first started.A poor dub led me to discover my favourite show, and so if nothing else, the dub will let new fans like me discover One Piece.Lets all hope this adventure continues for a long time.",

What an epic. For me, it was better than Bleach and Naruto. Luffy and the Strawhat Crews have their own unique characters that can be related to most of us in our daily life. The supporting characters and villains also have characteristics that will stuck in you mind for ages. I think that's why One Piece is the best. Most of us 'feel' for each of the characters in many ways...may it be in laughter, agony, suffering and so much more.

It has hilarious, roll on the floor from laughing humor and so much action it makes you wonder if the crew ever gets tired.But in its core, One Piece is about something else: it's about nakama. Nakama, a Japanese term generally referring to comrades, receives a completely new feeling in One Piece. Stand by your nakama, believe in them no matter what happens, no matter what anyone does or says about them. Help them in any situation, even if it means putting your own life on the line. With you nakama, you can do anything. And it is this extreme sense of comradry that makes you fall in love with the characters and wish you could be a part of the strange little group.It also teaches how humans are allowed to have flaws; in fact, all people do: seemingly perfect Swordsman and first mate Roronoa Zoro has no sense of direction whatsoever and can easily get himself lost on any one way street, navigator Nami is absolutely crazy for money, cook Sanji loses his mind once he sees a lady.. and the list goes on and on. But despite these flaws, they continue fighting. For each other and with each other. If one crewmember can't do it, somebody else will be right there for support.If you're looking for a funny, action-filled series whose main characters easily grow to your heart and feel like family: go for One Piece.

            "review": "It is difficult to sum up the story of a series with hundreds of episodes, TV specials and movies, so I'd rather just try to tell you what it is about and why it is so incredibly good.The series starts off with a guy named Luffy whose ultimate goal it is to become the one and only \"King of all Pirates\" and to find the greatest treasure in the world. The first episodes introduce him and some characters and make a lovely start that is entertaining and makes one want more. On his way Luffy meets a lot of very interesting characters who become his crew members and friends - each of them with an intense and captivating background story. Every character in this series - be it friend or foe - is either adorable, tragic, despicable or interesting at the least... no boring characters anywhere. Later on in the series, important events and story twists are often visualized or supported by huge appearances in the fabulous and unreal environments that our crew travels. This is perfectly done and helps the already epic feel of the story. I have seen 150 episodes, four movies and two specials so far and there were moments that made me cry, laugh, think and re-watch some episodes (especially 85-90) at least 30 times. You might come to the false conclusion of having a kids show here due to the presentation, but that is definitely wrong. People sometimes say about a movie or series that it is \"not a life changer, but entertaining\". That is definitely not the case here! I know it sounds nerdy, but this series has broadened my horizon in many ways and I recommend anyone to take the admittedly long time to get into this epic adventure. The best way to do so will be to watch the fan-subs which are as close to the original as a non Japanese will get (explanations of puns and traditions). There are of course some filler episodes in a huge project like this which won't blow you away, but that is only natural with hundreds of episodes and helps developing the characters. This show is an easy 10/10",

            "review": "One Piece was one of my favorite anime of all time until around episode 500. The various arcs with their stories and characters were highly enjoyable. The end of the Enies Lobby arc was the first time an anime actually made me cry and to this day whenever I go back to the scene that did that I still tear up. One Piece was just that good back then.Unfortunately the quality of the anime has dropped considerably from episode 500 onward. In the past when the anime was catching up usually Toei Animation produced a few filler episodes after they had finished a main arc. Even though some of these fillers were weaker than the main story episodes it allowed them to continue with a good pacing while producing episodes on a mostly weekly base.However the amount of content that was covered with each episode got more and more stretched out the further we got past episode 500. I can easily provide numbers for this as well.\nThe Enies Lobby arc had 56 chapters in the manga and was covered in 46 episodes. This means you had a bit more than 1 chapter per episode.\nThe Fish-Man Island arc was the first one to have more anime episodes (58) than manga chapters (56).\nThe Dress Rosa Saga (Punk Hazard and Dressrosa) had 172 episodes covering 148 manga chapters.\nThe Whole Cake Island arc had 95 episodes covering 78 chapters. This means we almost had 20 episodes within this arc with purely stretched out content and filler which dragged down the story as a whole because the build up to the fights and fights themselves got constantly stretched out. Toei also used basically any trick they could to accomplish that. The most lazy and obvious attempts at this I've seen was for example an episode where we saw a scene three times in the same episode. First the actual scene happened and then there were two flashbacks showing the exact same thing again within the same episode. This just destroys any good element you may have within the story.To make One Piece as good as it was the episode schedule would need to be changed so that they show sagas for about 6 months of the year while taking a break the other half of the year. Toei won't do that though as One Piece has been an important source of revenue for them for a pretty long time. And because of that the anime version of One Piece is basically ruined.I'd easily recommend One Piece until around Fish-Man island (8-9/10 rating). Everything afterwards gets a 2 or 3 out of 10. I finally dropped the anime at episode 904 even though I hadn't really gotten enjoyment out of it for quite a while.",

One piece recently celebrated it's 20th anniversary\nwhich started it's legacy in 1999 by the creator eiichiro oda.\nIt is set in a beautiful yet harsh world where pirates raise their flags high\nExpressing their freedom and sail the waters in the search of the grand treasure\n\"One Piece\" left behind by the Pirate King Gol d. Roger which marks the beginning\nOf \"the great pirate era.\" While the marines fend off pirates in order to protect civilians with their own sense of justice. The ruling system has it's very own dark side which strives the pirates to struggle and fight against it for their freedom.\nThe story follows an ambitious and high spirited young boy Monkey d. Luffy who aims to become the \"King of Pirates\"\nby conquering the seas and finding one piece. As he ventures on his quest he makes many allies with\nnever ending bonds and stumbles across enemies, kicking their ass for good and more importantly his crewmates who swore their loyalty to him as their captain and work hard to make their dreams come true.\nThe crew starts their journey in the grand line, the toughest seas that are feared by everyone which only Gol d. Roger was managed to conquer. The Grand line is described as hell and as a nightmare for every pirate which the crew rocks in as the \"Strawhat Pirates\" named after their captain's hat.\nOne piece has the best adventures, high action, drama and comedy that you can ask for. The bonds and relations between the characters are well built in such a way that if you follow them close enough you are sure to wet your tissues. With beautiful seas, islands and breath taking stunts, nerve wracking epic battles, loads of laughter, great openings and ending tracks and addictive OST's you will never want to miss this out anymore. I am sure you will be loving the crew while they progress towards their goal.\nFinally One Piece is a best source for inspiration and motivation, the theme of \"never give up on your dreams no matter what the cost is\" gets the good expression here. Every character of one piece whether it be protagonists or antagonists have their own believes, sense of justice and vision of the world for which they fight for putting them on high stakes. If you want to change your approach or view towards the world then you must watch one piece. It can be undoubtedly crowned as Best of the best shounen series. Their adventures still continue as they unfold various mysteries and cruel fates.\nAt the end of the day don't expect the crew to be all kind, gentle and selfless, they're PIRATES after all",

The main characters are so weird and insane that you immediately love them.First there's Monkey D. Luffy, who is this optimistic boy that can stretch his body thanks to a Gum-Gum fruit he ate as a child. He's the captain.Then there's the sarcastic sword master, Roronoa Zolo, who practices santoryu, which means he uses three swords at once. He is the first mate.Nami is the third member to join the crew. She's a thief who hates almost all pirates with a passion, but adores money. She's the navigator.Usopp is the fourth crew member. He's a total scaredy-cat and always tells lies. He's the crew's sharpshooter.The fifth crewman is Sanji, who's a serious ladies' man. He is the cook.And then there's Tony Tony Chopper, who is...a reindeer. He's just a tad shy. He's the crew's doctor.There might be more crew members, but I don't know of any others. They're all really interesting, but the enemies are just absurd. Every time you see a new one you have to stare at it for a minute or so just to figure out whether he's wearing a wig, or if that's REALLY his outfit.

This show has several problems, but by far the biggest issue is the way it tells its story.Each episode is about a random event from the family's past, and all these events happen over the course of many years, so we get to see this family grow and age over the season. Seems pretty straightforward on paper, but for this sort of thing to work, the events should be told CHRONOLOGICALLY, and this show absolutely doesn't do that, with each episode just being from a random year, making the whole thing feel very disconnected.Mind you, I watched the episodes NOT in the way they're presented, but in the order in which each episode takes place. So instead of episode 1, I started at episode 9, working my way through the season in a completely random fashion based on when each episode takes place. The order I watched it in didn't seem to have any real bearing on the narrative, so why couldn't they just release these episodes in the correct order?Even watching the show in the order God intended, I wasn't particularly invested in the unfolding series of events, nor did I care much about these characters or how their relationships were changing, and that's a big problem. Most of the cast I just don't find very interesting, such as the mom being an even more stereotypical version of Kyle's mom from South Park.As for the visuals, this show looks deceptively decent in stills. In motion, however, is a different story. Hearing this show was from the people behind BoJack, I was expecting the same rigged animation method, and that's exactly what we got here.So to make a long story short, Long Story Short just falls short. At least the first season does. Apparently there's another season on the way, and who knows, maybe this was just a particularly rough start and they'll improve upon everything that went wrong here? Seems like wishful thinking to me, but I guess it's not too late for this show to redeem itself. For now though, I am very much not a fan of this show, sad to say.",

Yet, all of them together (or even divided in groups) create this amazing chemistry that most people desire and few lucky ones have. The humor is wonderful, no matter what type of humor you like, you will get to a point where you will find at least something absolutely hilarious. There is slapstick, some light humor, some dark humor, some raunchiness, some cheesiness - a little bit of everything. The story is captivating; viewers keep coming back to see what situation fate (being the writers) puts the characters in today. It is truly a television masterpiece.There are, however, many people who scoff at the mentioning of 'Friends'. My guess is they've never seen or paid attention to the show. It's easy to discard something because \"everyone likes it\" and be \"unique\", when in reality the uniqueness is actually bias.

However, I do have my favorite characters/actors/actresses, as I'm sure everyone who has watched the show even once or twice, to those who are avid fans of it.We'll start from least favorite to best character/actor.Matt Le Blanc/Joey Tribbiani:Although some might say, because of his boyish good looks, his cute jokes that he delivers now and then (very well, mind you), and his ability to make you feel sweet and sorry for him at the same time, he is a great actor, and plays his part as Joey Tribbiani really well, he's probably my least favorite on the show.  I love him, don't get me wrong, but I just appreciate everyone else's talents on the show much more.Jennifer Aniston/Rachel Green:Rachel Green is a fun-loving, cute little waitress, who seems to always have trouble finding Mr. Right, who is plainly right in front of her 24/7.  Who is that, you ask?  Well, obviously Ross Gellar.  Her roommate Monica's brother.  Rachel is undoubtedly most everyone's favorite character who watches this show, just not mine.  Sometimes her personality can get a little annoying, and although I like her better than Joey, not very much more.  But, that doesn't go without saying that I don't love her in movies. Because, well, I do.Courtney Cox/Monica Gellar:It's hard to put Monica Gellar so far down the list, but if I have to make room for the other three, than so be it. As much as I love her on this show, she's just not as good as she is in the 'Scream' trilogy.  But, she certainly does a good job convincing you that she hates to be wrong, has to have everything her way, and is a real trooper with most all of her challenges on the show, that the writers give her.Lisa Kudrow/Pheobe Buffey:Now, I love Lisa Kudrow.  She is definitely one of the funniest woman comedians, which is why I classify her as my favorite female on the show. She outdid herself in 'Romy And Michele's High School Reunion', but she's extraordinary on this show.  She's so ingenious with her comedy which is no doubt why she's won several awards for her role on the program.David Schwimmer/Ross Gellar:It's so funny to me that I like him so much.  He's not the best actor in my opinion, but he was really good in Kissing A Fool, and really just ok in The Pallbearer, but my second favorite on the show.  He's so funny and he cracks me up with all of his facial expressions and the excellent way he delivers his lines.  He is definitely my second favorite character and actor on the show.Matthew Perry/Chandler Bing:They should have a shrine dedicated to this man.  He is so outstandingly funny in every single project that he works on!  He is so hysterical and a true actor in everything that he does, it is amazing that someone can be so talented.  I wish that he were given more roles than just the few comedies he's been in, including Friends. But, he is such a great character on the show, it's hard to picture the program without him. With that being said, I would also like to add that he is not only the best actor on the show, and one of my personal favorites, but I also believe that he would be such a great dramatic actor if given the chance.  If you've seen him in 'She's Out Of Control' you'll know what I'm talking about.So, with that I give this show a definite 10/10.  It's one of the best shows to come out within the last ten years, and definitely on my top five best shows of all time list.And that's my review.",

No, they're ongoing, sometimes stagnating, sometimes changing. Thats REAL.This show is about 6 people who love each other like family...which I must say as an 18 year old... is very real. Once you hit your late teens - early twenties...things begin to change.

Every week it was the same plot, with some wacky jokes by Phoebe, some moronic jokes by Joey, some boring jokes by Ross and Rachel, some anal retentive jokes by Monica, and some mildly charming jokes by Chandler. I realize, that this inherently is not a bad thing. Not every show is meant to push the boundaries of television. However, if you're going to rest on your laurels, and bring nothing new to the table, you should at least do a damn good job of it.

Each one of the characters is funny in their own way and due to the shows fast pace there is never a boring episode.I will say however that towards the end Friends did start to lose what it had but, never the less was still very good.

            "review": "It's an abysmal show. I've never ever got the popularity of this, especially outside of America.In each of the last 3 houses I've lived in over the last 10 years at least one person in each house has been an avid 'Friends' fan, so I am fully exposed to it, and have seen many episodes. It's also on tele every day.Where do I start? The title is as good a place as any. I can imagine the producers discussing that: \"Right, we've got a comedy about a group of friends, we need a name? How about Friends\" If that's the imagination it doesn't leave much hope for the story lines.I know it's a lighthearted sit com but come on? How old are they supposed to be? They were too old for that sort of lifestyle in series 1, here we are ten years later & nothings changed. They're all approaching the big 40! yet they're still living the lives of 18 year olds.And how the hell do they afford those penthouses? They change their jobs like I change my underpants, Monica worked in a kitchen, Joey can't get any acting work. The rent would be thousands.Friends is nothing more than the equally benal & tedious 'Saved by the Bell' but for grown-ups. It's the old flogged-to-death \"Three guys, three girls, all stunningly gorgeous, occasionally fancy or sleep with each other & with no friends whatsoever outside of their little group.\"The only thing funny about about Friends is unintentionally funny. Those parties they occasionally have in their flat (penthouse). The so called guests they invite, who stand in the background desperately trying to fit in & pass themselves off as close companions of the characters, when it's clear to the entire watching world that they've met for the first time at the start of the shot.It's a combination of many little things that contribute to the problem. It's the most unrealistic portrayal of New York in history. No black people, Chinese or anyone ethnic for that matter, even with minor parts. It's New York! One of the most multi cultural cities on the planet.Admittedly there is one funny aspect I have omitted. Chandler. The guy is enormously talented, makes the entire show, and seems solely responsible for what laughs or comedy there is.Rachel & Monica are likable characters & not annoying, but nor are they funny. But the past stories of either of them not being able to get a man. Come on? Please. Don't treat the viewer as a two year old.Joey is likable but is given no script to work with. Too many comedies think that by putting a thick character in they will automatically be amusing. Wrong. Trigger is Only Fools & Horses was thick but funny with it, because of the timing. He's comments were made at exactly the right time. Joey's are not, & unfortunately for a good actor & potentially very good character, he comes over more as irritating than anything else.But the real problem with Friends are in Ross & Phoebe. The only applicable description of Ross is that he needs a good kick up the back-side, to put some oomf (?) into the bloke. He's a drip. He just drones on & on in that slow dull manner, series after series. In any real life situation a Ross & a Rachel would just not be a couple. A Rachel & a Brad Pitt would be a couple, somewhat appropriately.But even he can't beat Phoebe for irritation. It's not the actress at all that's the problem, it's 100% the character. I just don't get her. The Floor Manager must hold up the \"Laugh Now\" board for the audience after every line she says. For the life of me, I just don't know what she says that is funny.And in the equally irritating coffee lounge. (Why are the sofas always empty? Never once have they had to sit somewhere else or wait for some other people to move), those scenes where she plays her guitar. I've been to funerals funnier than them. All she does is sing in coherent songs that don't rhyme, or make any sense whatsoever. Anyone could write a sketch like that.I also cannot sit through any show where people walk into other people houses without knocking on the door. No-one I know would put up with that, even from their Grandparents. Nor people who say \"Hey\" instead of Hello, but thats getting as tedious as the show now.",

Mencken's observation that \"No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.\"This is one of the most contrived shows ever produced. I have to assume that the people who find this series so riveting only do so to live vicariously through the lives of the characters. Either that or they are immature yuppie wannabees whose sensibilities have been compromised by gamma rays. The effusiveness of most of the positive reviews made me want to throw up.Friends\" reeks of nauseating sexual innuendos that are spat out like projectiles from a tennis ball machine.When it comes to dealing with sex, \"Cheers\", Frasier\" and \"Seinfeld\" were far more clever, witty and intelligent. \"Seinfeld\" co-creator Larry David wanted his show's humor to be based largely on real experiences. The show broke one barrier after another and either originated or popularized numerous expressions. \"Seinfeld's\" sexual humor was clever and original; on \"Friends\" it was on the same level as smut.On \"Cheers,\" Ted Danson as babe hound Sam Malone was far more endearing than any of the male characters on \"Friends.\" The show never ran out of hilarious one-liners, which was quite a feat considering that the show didn't often venture outside the confines of a bar.\"Frasier\" was both cerebral and jocular (how many TV shows make references to the Algonquin Round Table?) Kelsey Grammar's Frasier Crane was sidesplitting as he pursued one failed relationship after another, but he never descended to the low-level sexual innuendos that were characteristic of \"Friends.\"Unlike evergreens such as the \"Dick Van Dyke Show,\" 20 years from now \"Friends\" will have been consigned to the dustbin of forgotten TV shows alongside \"Meet Millie\" and \"Hey, Jeannie.\" We'll see.",

Let me count the ways:Firstly, it rated an \"F\" with the test audience (don't believe me, check The Smoking Gun).Secondly, it ran 10 years without being remotely funny ONCE (beating the record held by the completely laugh-free 8 year run of Full House, which, like this crap, was produced by a division of the Time Warner media empire, had three males and three females in a completely unrealistic version of a major American city, bland-looking guy of Mediterranean descent trying to get into show business, and a dumb guy named Joey).Third, that horrible theme makes NSync sound like The Beatles.Fourth, the cast couldn't act its way out of a paper bag (I thank one of the other posters for pointing out that Jennifer \"I'm not a star, I just sleep with them\" Aniston is Telly Savalas's goddaughter. Her father is also on Days of Our Lives. Can you say nepotism, boys and girls?).Fifth, the writers would eat up clichés like that last one I wrote as if they were brand new. And not only did they steal from the superior-by-default Seinfeld, they stole from Mr. Bean and even Punky Brewster! When Soleil Moon Frye, who really must have needed the money by that point, punched Chandler in the face, even that felt like a retread of a Punky episode where she punched Chad Allen in the face!Sixth, how can they afford an apartment like that in New York? They hold menial jobs yet they look like they could be living at Southfork. On other, superior, actually FUNNY roommate shows like The Odd Couple, Three's Company, Kate & Allie, and the grand dame of them all, The Golden Girls, they seem to look they are either living with their means or cutting back to afford to pay rent. I've seen fewer logical leaps on Gilligan's Island.What's worse is all the Emmies it got. Truly great shows like Bob Newhart's two classic sitcoms never won a single thing, yet this wins \"Best\" Comedy series. This show and Seinfeld (not a terrible show but an extremely overrated one as well) are the reason sitcoms are dead right now and will probably remain dead (the last time sitcoms were declared \"dead\" in the early 1980s was a golden age in comparison to today). As long as there continue to be reruns and DVD releases of classic, pre-1990s sitcoms such as I Love Lucy, The Dick Van Dyke Show, Bewitched, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, All in the Family, The Jeffersons, Soap, Cheers, Family Ties, Newhart, The Cosby Show, The Golden Girls, Married With Children, Roseanne, pre-2000 Simpsons, and countless others like it then I say let it die.This is truly the most vile, trite, unfunny, obnoxious television series of all time. I jumped for joy the day it was canceled, and I hope that future generations will see it for the garbage it truly is, because this one has been taken in by the snow job perpetrated by these hacks.",

            "review": "To me Friends is the most overrated show. The humor is weak and unintelligent, and the characters try too hard to be funny and act like everything is la-la land. Other than these major flaws, the show is just missing something else that many other comedy's have, and I think it's the lack of a good or serious plot along with humor. Other shows like Weeds and The United States of Tara are comical, but also have a strong plot and theme. I think the comedy in those shows makes it light in some ways and watchable, but also these shows are brilliant by highlighting individual people and society's problems. Even shows like Arrested Development and Grounded For Life apply more to the \"good comedy but strong plot and theme.\"And if the writer or director's goal was not to have a dramatic plot, then they should have some warm meaning to the show. For example, Full House, The Nanny, and Golden Girls had a lot of the humor but gave great messages. The importance of family support in Full House, how true friends will always help you in Golden Girls, and how a full-time care take for children can really help a family and bring out the best in children whose parents are absent such as The Nanny. I think Friends tries too much to be like a Seinfeld for teens and young adults. However, Seinfeld has much better writing and humor.Every time I watched this show it always ended up boring me. I really don't understand why people like this show so much where there is so much better comedy television out there.",

            "review": "Friends is about 6 Friends who live in New York and have to solve all of life's problems to sex, to relationships, to... well... basically thats what its all about.The idea contains the same old friendships, relationship, babies, love, marriage, job, and materialism. Nothing to contribute to society... never once I see the characters face real problems of debt, psychological torture, or identity crisis (Like Chandler experiencing what being Gay feels like for a day, or Rachel hanging with the poor. Or even Phoebe living in an asylum?) And about the racial cultures... Usually I never see them date anyone else other than a few colors to \"liven\" the space. Oh, the token black person that comes out one or two episodes is not helping either. Seeing as New York is full of culture, they made it look like the other races are not important.Their lifestyle is perfect. They crapped money out of their really low-paying jobs and spend most of their time well, sipping their coffee, stalking about that hot guy or girl and plans to bang them later to the episode, ending with a break-up for the dumbest of reasons.Aside from Chandler, their jobs are almost impossible to ask why their apartments costs more than what they earn. Well, Monica has \"rent control\" but hey... no one tried to kick her out yet... Ross is still controlling his money after all the divorces he has been in. Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe gave a speech on not taking charity, but hey, they suck the living breeches of the first three and claiming paying them back was almost impossible.Okay, off with the plots, let's go to the characters...Character analysis: Chandler - He is apparently one of the more humorous characters. He is a sample of a realistic person who we can hang out in the office or sip some coffee or something. I don't have problems with him and Monica together, to the dismay of all the true-blue Frendsian fans.Phoebe - I like her for being a bit different in the first few seasons... but then after a while, she started being horny, annoying, and kind of a hypocrite. Okay, so she has a hard life... but people like her in real life, struggle to be as normal as possible. She just left that philosophy behind because of it. It's not even trying until the tenth season or so...Monica - She isn't a funny character, but she has been a person who actually is believable in ways that she is right, and she is apparently the mature one. Sadly, she is usually looked down upon because her other Friends think that her style is annoying. Sadly, her baby-freak, \"I can be like anyone else\" philosophy threw me off after like season one. I always wondered why she wasn't kicked out of the circle.Rachel - I hate her. She hasn't changed ever since day one, to be honest. Her personality is this \"Me-Me-Me!\" spoiled brat who went to the city, and a few jobs and a million boyfriends later... it's still all about \"Me!\" The relationship with her and Ross was somewhat annoying for and a mood killer for almost forever, and almost in the last episode of the series, BANG! They're together again. Can Ross just leave or slap Rachel for all the horrible things she has done to him? Oh Noooo... because Ross is too in \"loooove\" with Rachel... Reasons were almost to no idea... Having sexual thoughts with Chandler and almost having a short, useless hit-off with Joey was also not helping.Ross - I pitied his first season philosophy and hey, I liked him for being at least sympathetic there... just that he had two additional divorces that he became a screaming, yelling, irritating person who is smart and intelligent, yet acts dumb and immature for his age. The whole Rachel thing is lost of chemistry and yeah, they were on a break. Rachel is apparently responsible for all of the things that happened to them and then claiming after the whole fiasco that the writers make it say that it's Ross' fault anyway for Rachel's doing. Ross would be better off on a suicide for being with a devil woman.Joey - Dumb Actor who doesn't do anything to contribute to society. Oh yeah, his spin off may be the worst thing anyone has ever made... Even if I can feel things from the characters. He is a handsome guy, that's a contribution right? And Him having sex with 500 girls is considered a real good thing. In general, actors have to research their roles, and Joey... he just swoops in Shakespeare because hey... He's an actor!To conclude, I have been annoyed by the show... and I get why people love it so much. It's the art of Escapism of them in a Fantasy world that makes everyone love them so. But sadly, I have watched shows that actually make use of real life as a humor tool that makes Friends forgettable for me. For ten years, nothing truly EVER happened.. and parodies like \"Furends\" are apparently more of a short version of the whole rant.A 1 out of ten... Just because I can't give negative number rankings. :(",

The cast is great and I LOVE seeing Scott Patterson and Chad Michael Murray back on the screen, they absolutely blow these roles out of the park and I have been a huge fan of them for years! As a newer actress, Morgan does amazing at playing the role of Maggie and ensuring the audience feels and understands what she's feeling.

Sully is complex and the actor plays the broken soul with a lot of realistic emotion.Lost one star because sometimes I just enjoy watching a story without the far fetched drama sprinkles tossed in, but I know the drama is needed to keep the audience intrigued.I really hope a season two comes - I want Maggie and Sully to have an honest conversation, I want Maggie and Cal to have a love story, I really want to see Edna and Frank and their hopeful love story, and honestly I want to know what's going to happen with Lola, Sydney, Rob and Jackson (considering they're the ones all the \"extra and out there\" drama seems to come from).",

The show pulls heart strings with the wonderful soundtrack, natural acting and amazing landscapes of Nova Scotia.My favourite storyline is that between Maggie and Cal. Big thank you to Chad M Murray for portraying Cal so wonderfully. Chad gives so much deepness and dignity to his character. I believed Cal every single time I saw him in the scene. Of course, there is also Morgan Kohan who portrayed Maggie. I like this edge about Maggie. I like how bold and sensitive her character is. I also really enjoyed the slow pacing and how carefully their relationships unfold, how we find just a new bit with every episode, which builds up a lot of good tension.As for Sully and Maggie, their story is very touching, but I would like Maggie to be a bit more mature in this. Having some similar experience in my life and watching how much those two need to finally open up to each other, I see Maggie's hesitancy a bit far-fetched. I just hope they manage to put their past behind and get closer in season 2!It won't be a full review if I don't mention the general atmosphere of the show. It is such a pleasure watching a small and caring community in this beautiful nature. Add here soulful soundtrack and you have a cinematic gem! Can't wait for season 2!",

For views,ratings & that is unfortunate.Honestly it moves very slow & nothing like a series that says alot,but also leaves you hanging in a cryptic fashion..\nEver have a friend that likes to talk & talk,but never gets really to a point or asks for prayers on social media yet won't say why & leaves you hanging in their conclusions? Like that!Series today unlike years back milk things to death,with many parts & seasons,where it impacts a viewers interest..\nWhere unlike years back you're not as excited,to see what happens next week-quality cliffhangers are one thing-unlike how it's approached now.What could of helped,again..\nDon't stretch things out,air two episodes or drop all episodes at once.Give us a few milk bones of closure,resolve,ect..\nIt won't ruin anything enough,for a viewer to not return.So far the lead female or any character,isn't likeable enough currently but will give it another chance.I have not read any book based on this,unsure if that would make a difference? Regardless it's lackluster in several aspects,maybe a bad script or certain actors to their acting but somethings a miss.Definitely isn't a Virgin River feel,but also think it's trying to playoff in a similar vibe.. So it lacks(loosely)originality or is the Wish version,therefore leaves true fans dissatisfied.Can't say the scenery or anything is great enough yet,but again will be following up if can get into the series more.Edit-\nI watched all 10 episodes even a few a couple times for perspective,but honestly my original review remains it really lacks & feel partly it's due to several(main)actors.Feel Maggie comes across boring,monotone in talking & lacks emotion.Sully comes across grumpy & not real great,maybe Maggie inherited his personality.Even when the show had emergency moments it felt cartoon-ish in approach,easily resolved & no real emotion attached to care.Hope now that Maggie,got her court stuff resolved..\nWe get more personality,drama,laughter,love & so forth.Also maybe Sully can improve,once he confronts his past ghosts.Will Cal return or not,his role was decent..\nFar as the rest of the characters,you don't remember them enough to care & if you do it's rather brief like(when Frank got shot)because of other moments.",

But THIS show, the soundtrack is annoying. And the sound increases too many times that I find myself having to adjust the sound. The main character, Maggie is a neurosurgeon. Initially seeing her in action was fine but the way she handles stress and so forth makes me frown. I was a critical care Respiratory Therapist. Now I'm disabled due to an injury with chronic pain. Stuff I've been through in my professional life and in my personal life, my stress relief is screaming in a pillow or back then, working out. I know people react differently but her responses to her problems just seem too cheesy. I just think there was a lot of over acting. I don't remember who wrote the article but, better than Virgin River? Nah ah, no way, no how. I will continue to watch cuz I'm watching it while none of my other shows are on. But, if there is a season two, I'd have no idea if I'd watch it. Right now, it's on while I'm watching it so it doesn't hold my full attention. Oh, I'm going to be a little too immature right now with this next comment. But, the boyfriend of Maggie, Andrew, who is played by Allan Hawco is definitely not who'd I consider a good catch. His beard and mouth, all I see is Homer Simpson. I fast forward or don't look at the TV cuz, eww. Five stars cuz it's something to watch and put on TV to pass the time for me. But I guess I can compare it to a Hallmark movie. So if you like Hallmark, over dramatic and cheesy, you should like this.Edit: I didn't realize there was a season two when I was writing the first review. I shouldn't have said what I said because I tend to have to finish shows. The only time I don't finish watching, is if it's really boring that I can't stay awake watching. Anyhow, I added an extra star because I think season two is better than the first season. Still can't watch Allan Hawco.",

Downton Abbey was beautifully produced, well cast and interesting, when it was first advertised it looked as though ITV had a hit and from the first episode I think Downton Abbey lived up to that expectation.I for one loved how elegant Downton Abbey was. The photography was beautiful and skillful, while the scenery was breathtaking and the costumes were exquisite. The scoring was also very good, often very hypnotic and beautiful. The direction was controlled, the episodes were well paced and for me the characters were believable my favourites being Violet and Robert.The writing in general was another strength. It was witty in a subtle way, is often funny and could be heart warming and poignant too, the best coming from Violet and Mrs Hughes I felt. The only bit of dialogue that rang false, and this is such a minor criticism, is Robert's \"Downton is my third parent and my fourth child\" which came across as somewhat cheesy. And the stories were well written and as believable as the characters, not to mention pretty original.And of course the acting was excellent. Maggie Smith was perfect as Violet. She plays this sort of character well, and she had such good timing and dialogue. Plus I love her in costume. Hugh Bonneville was dashing, and I cannot get over how beautiful Michelle Dockery was here. Jessica Brown-Findlay was also fine as another of my favourite characters Lady Sybil, and Phyllis Logan was always good value though I would love to see more of her if and when the series returns.In conclusion, Downton Abbey was a wonderful series thanks to the great cast and production values especially and I cannot wait to see more. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Not just that much of the history is incorrect or missing key elements but the characters are never fleshed-out and remain one-dimensional. Plot lines quickly fade away, never to reappear without any just cause. Other plots go on for far too long.The writing by Julian Fellowes, is surprisingly poor, even for an actor. The obvious lack of research is for me unnerving. Worse than that is Fellowes simply plagiarizes most of the story and even characters. A little Waugh, Jan Struther, Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins, Coward, Alcott, Forster and Christie to name but a few. Even Maggie Smith's character comes off as one dimensional; a sassy dowager stock character with nothing to offer other than witty one-line barbs.If Fellowes' name (I only know of him as the writer of Gosford Park - but that film had a strong director, Robert Altman) is enough to get a project green-lighted, surely the production budget allows enough for a script doctor? Downton Abbey is in dire need of one.And because I am familiar with a few of the fine actors in Downton Abbey, watching them wrestle with a weak script and simply terrible plot lines, it's embarrassing to witness. Only Siobhan Finneran seems to be able to rise above the putrid pablum.Yes the gowns, jewels, men's suits, complexions, interior sets, exteriors etc...are all gorgeous and beautiful. But that's it. There is nothing beneath the exquisite facade. No substance.It's incredible how many awards this trash has won in both the UK and US. Downtown Abbey should be shown to screenwriters and playwrights for how NOT to write. It's also incredible that this program scores so highly on IMDb; just unbelievable.If you like period dramas, Masterpiece Theatre, BBC stuff - you should search out Granada TV's 1981 Brideshead Revisited, PBS' 1970's Upstairs Downstairs (produced by the excellent John Hawkesworth) or Christine Edzard's Little Dorrit (1988), BBC's more recent Bleak House (2005) and Little Dorrit (2008).",

As a cousin of an English family with deep affection for the monarchy and respect for the aristocracy, my perspective is an odd mix of Democratic ideals, old-time Republican values and curiosity about and appreciation of the social structure which prevailed so long in England. Downton Abbey appears to present a very balanced depiction of the social, political, economic and historical forces which drove the lives and fortunes of the classes and produced strange and almost incomprehensible behavior to comply with an unwritten, all-pervasive code.

(anyone interested can find short interviews with actor Hugh Bonneville and writer Julian Fellowes via youtube and be infected with their enthusiasm as well as getting an explanation, if you need one, of the setting) The house is suitably dramatic and the fabrics, the costumes, the camera shots of ringing bells and curious meal courses in the form of fences of asparagus, the morning light, or lit windows across the lawn, and the smooth work of all the actors make it something to watch and be both interested and relaxed. There is just enough drama and just enough calm, nothing seems overdone, and (after two episodes) the characters, as it switches between moments of their various days, are none of them an unwelcome change from the view of the last. It is a costume drama but 1912 after all was just as real as 2010 and it is, quite separate from costumes, about people, several different people, house workers and owners, their motives, their histories, pain, relationships, scheming allegiances, awkwardness or ease, old ways and the coming of those things we now call modern electric lights, the middle classEnjoyable so far.

It is an honest depiction of what people \"downstairs and upstairs\" went through during those years. The conventions, the rigid rules, the traditions, all changing just in a ten year period and being uprooted and twisted by the new winds of war.There is something for everybody here.

            "review": "Back in the 1980s Granada made two long drama serials at almost the same time. One was \"Brideshead Revisited\" based on Evelyn Waugh's novel and the other was \"Jewel in the Crown\" – the dramatisation of Paul Scott's extraordinary \"Raj Quartet\". Both these series were masterpieces and if you watch them today you will find they have stood well the test of time. The drama tradition of Granada, of some of the other commercial companies and, of course, of the BBC is strong and is something of a jewel in the crown of British television. It is also an important source of revenue, not least in the United States, where posh British TV has a small but well-heeled following. This brings me to \"Downton Abbey\", superficially in the great tradition and with obvious links also to the very successful and ground-breaking \"Forsyte Saga\" and \"Upstairs Downstairs\" of the 1960s and 1970s. Downton is set in the second and third decades of the twentieth century and we have moved from Edwardian complacency and excesses through the horrors of the Great War to the early 1920s. As with \"Upstairs Downstairs\" we see life, and to an extent history, through the eyes of the aristocracy and simultaneously from the perspective of those in the Servants' Hall.Over the 16 episodes that have so far been transmitted, spanning the years 1912-1920, the stories are reminiscent of a Soap like \"Eastenders\" or \"Coronation Street\" in that there are episode ending cliff-hangers and improbably extreme story developments. Every historic event from the sinking of the Titanic through women's suffrage, the Irish independence movement, the Battle of the Somme, the post-war Flu epidemic and many others is a trigger for something to happen in the plot. In addition we have adultery, murder, homosexuality, alcoholism, illness and recovery or death, the black market, inter-class affairs and marriage, and most of the seven deadly sins in sharp relief. The stories are often signalled rather obviously and it is an amusing parlour game to predict what will happen next - as with any soap. Taken as a whole the story is totally preposterous and the \"issues\" are not handled with any subtlety at all – there is none of the restraint of a Galsworthy, a Waugh or a Scott.The starting point for Downton Abbey was in the creative mind of the writer Julian Fellowes and its main inspiration was clearly that author's film script for \"Gosford Park\" - which won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in 2002. But whereas this film lasts a couple of hours and was tightly directed by Robert Altman Downton goes on for 20 – and running! The characters are largely pastiches of real people. Maggie Smith, for example, is wonderful as the Dowager a figure straight out of Pantomime - Dame Maggie overtly seeks hisses from the stalls. Fine actors like Hugh Bonneville, Penelope Wilton and Dan Stevens struggle with a script that is always close to parody and sometimes spills over into farce. Indeed at times there is a slight sense that they know what they are being asked to say, or the absurd plot twist in which they are expected to participate, has moved into lampoon territory and that Mel Brooks or the Directors of \"Airplane\" or \"Something about Mary\" are in charge.The great strength of Brideshead Revisited, Jewel in the Crown and the Forsyte Saga is that the stories had passed the tough test of being seen as credible in the original novel format. They were great books before they became great television. The original screenplay of \"Downton Abbey\" has had none of the checks and balances that apply to the written word. And because the medium is only to be visual, and in a number of time-limited episodes, it is presumed that there is a need to provide colourful action rather than attempt any true characterisation. We are supposed to like the Earl of Grantham because he is a benevolent toff – fragile but caring with a true sense of noblesse oblige. But compare his character, which is utterly superficially sketched, with the way that Evelyn Waugh gradually introduces Lord Marchmain in Brideshead - we feel we know the Marquess long before we meet him. The same superficiality applies to Downton's \"below stairs\" characters most of whom are stereotypes we have met frequently before.The visual impact of \"Downton Abbey\" is strong and in this area the production values are high. The sets, both in the studio and on location, are beautifully designed and the costumes and other artifacts are good and look authentic. There is a strange paradox here which I suspect has led some to assume that because it looks good then it is good - perhaps ignoring the often wooden acting and sloppy direction. Downton's viewing figures are good and this is no doubt reflected directly in the income received from advertisers and the revenue from the sale of overseas rights and DVDs etc. - it is evidently a profitable venture. So a legitimate response to those critics who deplore the triviality of the series would be to never mind the quality and weigh the receipts.There is nothing really wrong with \"Downton Abbey\" if you see it for what it is – a Soap of fleeting interest with can pass the time on an autumnal evening. However Downton does take itself quite seriously at times and some of the acting is so pompously self-important that it can only be seen as light comedy, which it isn't meant to be, or over-written moralising trash - which at times it comes dangerously close to being.",

But all of the lesser roles are played to perfection with special mention for Brendan Coyle as John Bates, Joanne Froggatt as Ana, Michelle Dockery and Laura Carmichael.Complicit in schemes involving wicked behavior are two of the downstairs help played brilliantly by Siobhan Finneran and Rob-James Collier as Thomas, both of whom cast a shadow over the household.The plot has dialog that is always witty and good for a quick chuckle or a gasp of disapproval and the character motivations are all played out in a convincing manner true to each person involved.Very compelling to view the fluid story unfold with its many sub-plots and shadings of the class warfare that existed in the U.K. then and now.Absolutely one of the most rewarding and richly satisfying shows from Great Britain that have come along in recent years. The color photography amid location settings create the proper atmosphere for the entire story which takes place just before WWI among a wealthy titled household undergoing some major changes inside the castle walls.",

However my personal \"gut\" feeling is that these kinds of events occurred even in their (upper classes) ascent.Therefore this rose tinted exposition of the fancifully illustrated decline of the upper classes masqueraded as inevitable result of a more cognizant society tries ones patience to the point of breakage...but apparently box office success for this pap is assured.",

With the outstanding quality of recent \"period\" shows, I was disappointed by Downton Abbeys idea of what the period would look like. I highly doubt servants had perfectly groomed eyebrows and impeccable makeup which the servants seem to have on this show. The costumes are a hit and miss affair with often inaccurate attire for the period. I must mention the servants beautifully ironed and kept uniforms which are again, a real put off! I find any show produced today that is based in a particular period must make the effort and be realistic because the bar has been set extremely high! The ridiculous lack of authenticity really puts me off!Then we get to the script! I couldn't tell if someone was a servant or an aristocrat the way they were talking to each other in particular, Mary and Anna. The familiarity and connection between the servants and the main characters is beyond stupid, but must appeal to soap opera lovers!I am astounded this show is so popular considering the numerous inaccuracies and the terrible accents which, again, are in no way realistic, Viewers seem to be easily pleased these days or have very low standards!Ok, it's been a few years since I wrote that scathing review and have rewatched Downton Abbey and now appreciate it especially with what's going on around the world and the terrible shows being produced now, including The Crown which twists facts and real life events into a one sided narrative meant to brainwash the public.I now appreciate the acting from most of the cast and the storyline is really good and covers the challenges aristocrats experienced in the UK, how people regarded gay people, changing technologies and changing attitudes in general and how the war forced many of these changes..I now appreciate seeing polite people who genuinely care about others especially those not as fortunate as them. Watching Downton Abbey now, gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling and takes me back to a time when things were less complicated and people were not as selfish, and I don't mean the early 1900's.. when Downton Abbey was aimed at..Downton Abbey is a well made show, with good actors, excellent characters and an excellent storyline.. I really should have given the show more of a chance before forming my initial opinion and looked deeper into the show.Yes, it's not prefect but I now thoroughly enjoy watching the show and appreciate it for what it is.. a relaxing well made show that takes us back to a time when life was more simple.",

It's fluff at best, with some entertaining bits and pieces. Maggie Smith, in particular, carries the whole thing, like Atlas. But it's Maggie Smith, not the character and definitely not the script, at work in that one consistently good thread.

The plot is choppy, and the episodes not well linked together. The focus is on backstabbing all round, with fairly stereotypical characters who curse constantly in an attempt to keep it interesting. There is a constant Predator vs Prey interaction, and the only thing that keeps one engaged is a desire to see blood spilled! The dialog and writing is childish, with everyone interrupting one another's sentences. The camera work is jerky, I guess to add a certain nuance to the shots. It's a story of shifting alliances which is common in the business world. Overall, it's worth putting at the bottom of any streaming queue, and using it to fill periods of drought in the queue.Season 3: So far, this has been \"more of the same\", except that the writers have now made the story telling a secondary focus and instead, have embarked on a quest to show how clever they are with using erudite dialog and obscure literary references in the conversation between actors. The dialog comes across as stilted and often delivered by everyone stammering when talking. It's beginning to look more like a series one might now find on NPR or similar sort of station.

Coupled with a backdrop of corporate America, it seemed like a show right up my alley. I had absolutely no idea that the show would exceed my expectations by a large mile.Not since The Sopranos have I seen an interplay of character dynamics this good, especially the toxic traits of those characters. Every little interaction is important, and affects another character on some or the other level significantly. Succession makes sure that behind the gaudy, showy nature of the Roy family, the ugliness of their existence is visible to you, even in the most subtle ways. The show both revels in and critiques the world it bases itself in. And I don't remember a character-driven drama being this thrilling. Hostile takeovers are usually not exciting to people uninterested in the financial world, but this show makes sure you understand the stakes involved. Like, Breaking Bad-level of tense.Of course, much of this is possible because of the phenomenal cast. I want Jeremy Strong to win an Emmy this year so badly. Kendall Roy is one of the most brilliant (and surprisingly sympathetic) characters I've seen, a mixture of Christopher Moltisanti and Jesse Pinkman, with a slice of your average venture capitalist. I just hope it doesn't typecast him as a Wall Street-type, although I love him in The Big Short too. I want him to win more than Brian Cox, who scares the living daylights out of me as Logan Roy when he merely enters a room. Then there's Sarah Snook as the prideful Shiv, an excellent, pitch-perfect arc like no other. And my man Kieran Culkin as the foul-mouthed-but-concerned Roman, another truly surprising sympathetic turn. And of course, when I talk about Roman, I will talk about Gerri, a role that actress J Smith Cameron absolutely kills, and should have received an Emmy nomination for. And this paragraph is incomplete without my love for Matthew McFadyen and Nicholas Braun in the most hilariously paired people that are Tom and (cousin) Greg since Chris and Paulie Walnuts.Succession doesn't mince words (or chicken hahahaha). Nothing on the script feels wasted. And the insults are ingenious. As long as Jesse Armstrong remains showrunner, this show will surprise us in the most insane of ways. The research shows (the writers' room is apparently asked to read the Financial Times everyday), and it adds to the authenticity of the show, one which I appreciate. I would also be stupid not to talk about the best original opening theme I have ever heard in any TV show. Nicholas Britell has made a masterful score which does not sound excessive at all. Much like in Mr Robot, the score amplifies the mood.If you're watching Succession, don't be thrown off by the first 2 episodes of the show (I actually like them). Give it time, because by the 6th episode you'll probably fall off your bed. And come season 2 (which I consider one of the greatest executions of anything in television history because it's flawless), you'll drop your jaw every 25-30 minutes of screentime, which is basically every halftime moment of an episode.Succession deserves every honor coming its way. HBO has landed another absolute winner in its roster, one that will likely age extremely well with a season or two and be compared to the other Golden Age dramas of this generation. Yes, by that, I mean shows like Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Leftovers, and maybe, just maybe, The Wire and The Sopranos. Good call on ditching Westworld for marketing this, HBO. This is arguably going to be my favorite deconstruction of capitalism right now.I can't wait for season 3 at all. I'm just going to rewatch season 2 till then. All the white kids fight for a kiss from daddy, and that might not sell the show a lot. But the fight spins into so many nuances it's hard to look away and just dismiss them as that.",

These adults have no sense of responsibility. They swear all the time -- the f-word always amuses them. Whenever an adult touches another, they all get hard, or hot. They drink like teenagers. They do drugs like teenagers. They talk like teenagers. They are, essentially, teenagers.Worse, however, is that these pretend adults, who are suppose to be running one of the largest media empires in the country and a major presidential political campaign, don't sound as though they have the slightest idea what they're doing: their business jargon all comes out of some Business 101 text book. It's worse than just bad, it's silly.Worst of all, however, is that all the adults are terrible people. Worse than terrible. They're all cruel, mean, vindictive, evil, and thoughtless, just as a raging teenager might portray his loathed parent. These are the worst people ever created for a television show.All in all, the program is compelling and fast, but only if you want to watch a juvenile world view.

Every time somebody has something dramatic to say there is an establishing shot of them then a fast go-to quick zoom when they start talking...please stop, we get it, we know who is talking! This is sophomoric filmmaking and the easy way out as far as creativity, your script should be strong enough so you don't have to hold the viewers hand and push them in front of the person talking. Done well the appropriate zoom is important, here its almost comedic, feels like it was pulled out of a bag. The shaky camera, this technique is used to make the viewer feel like they are actually there, done right, subtly and sparingly it can add drama and inclusion to scene, done in excess and poorly it looks like a cheap TV drama, unfortunately in this show its the latter, it feels like you are in a disaster earthquake film. \nShots were all over the framing board and visually disjointed doing an Injustice to the actors, script and most important the viewers.I would have liked to review the actual show but I couldn't make it pass the cinematography.

Here is hoping it makes it as an ongoing series, especially since it is not yet another crime drama! Not that Criminal Mains, The Mentalist, Without A Trace will lose their place among the best show on television, but with all the spinoffs on the crime shows, the available choices have been dwindling lately.SUITS is a lawyer show. Set in New York (captured, by the way, in beautiful cinematic vistas) it focuses on a very successful law firm, managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) who balances the talents of her two top lawyers, the smarmy Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) who is a control freak, and the very brilliant but egotistical Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht). There is a particularly appealing and very bright secretary Donna (Sarah Rafferty) and a beautiful paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markel) and last but certainly not least by any means there is Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) - a young lad who is extremely bright, has a photographic memory, dropped out of college because he took tests for fellow students and got caught, fell into marketing drugs by default for need of money so that he could pursue his dream of being a lawyer, and falls quite by accident into the role of being selected as associate to the brilliant but self absorbed Harvey Spector. This is the team of characters who are destined to provide fascinating substories as they interact.The dialogue (Aaron Korsh and Sean Jablonski) is clever, bright, snappy, unclichéd, witty, and helps define the complexities of the characters. The pacing is exceptional (directors Kevin Bray and John Scott) and the series has the appearance of a high-end movie - excellent cinematography, expansive development of story in well-selected locations - but most of all this is a cast that is worthy of attention every moment they are on camera. It will be interesting to watch how Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht grow into our psyches: both are exceptionally fine and provide a spectrum of the lawyer personality we haven't seen on a series before. This should be a major hit!Grady Harp",

After not expecting much, it really caught me by surprise how great this was.It reminds me of Law & Order but with more drama and a following into the characters lives. It reminds me of \"House\" in many ways. It features a strict boss that will do anything to get the job done, and an employee willing to do anything for his boss.It is certainly a new age show that will bring in audience from all ages from teenagers to seniors.

Unfortunately the clever seems to have turned into everyday unspectacular. The characters are now just bumbling ants without direction and without any capacity for passionate relationships.

I can guarantee you that there is not a single lawyer at a high power NYC law firm that didn't go to law school. Additionally, no lawyer as green as Mike would be given so much attention. Here is where I will cut the show some slack- without such deviations from the truth there would be no show.Some reviewers liken this show to House but with lawyers. Sure, there are some common elements surrounding Harvey being cold-hearted and cocky yet excellent as his job. But this is where I want to draw the distinction: characters like Harvey actually exist in this world (minus the likability). There are charming, proud, extremely competent, rude, driven, and ruthless lawyers in every major firm in every major city. At some point it becomes a requirement of the job. Doctor House meanwhile is too much of a self-destructive train wreck for my taste.If you want to get a glimpse into working at a high power law firm, an investment bank, or any other high stakes pressure-cooker job look no further. Keep the insane hours, lose the friendliness, and amplify the cockiness and voilà: a glimpse of reality.

What made the latter great was its unflinching (if somewhat biased) glance into the human psyche, the way it looked at the anxieties, the lies and the little betrayals that the characters on the show liked to sweep under the rug but that ended up coming back to haunt them, often in dramatic and life-threatening ways. That, and the contradictory and vulnerable characters the show placed at each other's mercy.\"Suits\", however, is not like that. It doesn't have any of the inquisitiveness and candor of \"House\". All we see on this show is a group of young, pretty, rich, high-powered yuppies who are too cool to care about anything. The main characters always get the last word, know the wittiest response, look the most elegant. Everyone \"gets it\" or ends up as a loser on the sidelines of the show. Basically, all the main characters (and most of the supporting characters) are the same. Of course, Mike is still a bit wet behind the ears and thus not quite as stylish as the other characters. But that's the only difference between him and the other protagonists.That's why it was impossible for me to care about anyone on the show. It's not interesting to me to follow the journey of people who excel at everything without showing any kind of depth or conflict. Of course, the characters on the show have their flaws, too: they are \"too committed to their work\", they are \"too straight-forward\", they \"can't keep their opinions to themselves\", etc.. In other words: they have exactly the character traits their job calls for. And we are supposed to accept these \"flaws\" as somehow adding complexity to the characters at hand?The show has some intelligent plot lines, that is true. I enjoyed the way the lawyers were trying to best each other, spinning the issues at hand around, looking for the little detail that could help them - it's an interesting show concept. Also, the acting is pretty good. But after 6 episodes, I grew so tired of the bland characters that I skipped to the middle of season 2 to see if there would be any character growth. There wasn't. The main characters were still the same as in the beginning.The boring characters are what kills this show for me. If I want to see effortless success, I can always watch my washing machine.

The story is centred around the firm's best lawyer, Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht), an egotistical, uncompassionate, charmingly witty Harvard graduate who will do whatever it takes to win – \"The best closer this city has ever seen\"; and his associate Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), an under-achieving compassionate genius with an eidetic memory who strikes lucky by having the opportunity to work at one of the highest profile legal firms even after being caught for attempted drug trafficking and without the required qualifications. The show follows both characters as they face different legal and personal challenges in each episode whilst maintaining the gregarious and quick-witted rapport between the two.The show offers plenty of variety besides the law by developing the relationships of many characters inside the firm, \"Pearson Hardman\", managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres), a career-minded powerful woman. Jessica must balance between her two best lawyers, a devious Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) and Harvey, whose relationship is filled with rivalry and playable banter, is certainly one to make you laugh. The show also follows the stories of the beautiful Rachel (Meghan Markel), a paralegal whose test anxieties are stopping her from fulfilling her ambitions of going to Harvard to study law and Donna (Sarah Rafferty) a smart, sexy secretary.Besides the two leading characters, Suits is balanced excellently with an ensemble cast filled with intriguing relationships and an original and sharp script combined with the beautiful backdrop of New York City to make this a thoroughly enjoyable TV show which I can't help but grin ear-to-ear from start to finish and I hope it continues its high standards for seasons to come.

Caveat: I write about media as my profession, and, again, I rarely take time out to write this kind of stuff because I have enough on my plate. But, SUITS has emerged as a private indulgence. Yes, it's an L.A. Law remake (and there are still issues with genre -- \"what does it want to be?\" is still a problem), but it's a much more self- conscious and playful show, and the writing is brilliant, evoking noir-like banter. After two years, and my original review, I am happy to see the show develop its women characters (and not overly sexualizing Jessica, like before, one of the most powerful African-American women characters on television) -- I like the new stylists' choices of making her stylish/sexy but not overly Ally MacBeal, such as the use of asymmetrical dresses/suits during episodes when she was in conflict with Harvey or Darby (nice homonym, by the way). But, what's the deal with all of the bags/purses? Professional women don't bring Hermes Birkin bags to every in-office conference (I think I have counted the number of purses in a shot, and it's kind of astounding, enough already with product placement). The \"Rachel\" character has also developed. I was a little worried about scene changes: those establishing pov shots that focused on Rachel's bootie, but then there was a funny complementary shot focusing on a woman looking at a man's bootie. Rachel is developing as a character; that said, the actress who plays her needs to eat a muffin, as she's tubercular these days. I keep expecting her, out of starvation, to fall over the copy machine. Still love the filmic banter (meta-cinematic references to film culture, super fun and opens up the show), and now it's not just btw Harvey and Mike, but is extending across the show/characters (even to Louis). And, yes, Louis. He's still a caricature, but he has pathos -- yes, he's a comic relief figure but also a person now. And, I think my favorite episode this season was the great Cat Trial, which made me laugh out loud in its surrealism. The show is now much more bifurcated, but in a good way. It attempts to explore legal culture (but it does not glorify such work, as it examines the economic determinism that runs against humanist ethics) but also has these really fun, outrageous, implausible fun sub-narratives that are about human empathy, struggles and, well, neuroses. And, what is legal culture but the expression of human neuroses? I like where it's going because I don't know where it's going, which is a rarity. That said, as a suggestion, I think it needs to exteriorize (beyond the lame Game of Thrones line) & open up the space of the firm. And, Mike Ross is now kind of in limbo. I still think he should go to law school and maybe now with Rachel (as a means of personal legitimization?). Could be some fun scenes of them being equalized in law classes.",

Instead each show became more typically an average soap opera where the main characters were routinely thrown into conflict with each other and starting keeping secrets and telling lies to each other. This is the staple diet of any soap you care to watch and the easiest way to create tension and drama. The love affair between Rachel and Mike was juvenile and it got to the point where I would fast forward when Rachel came into view - all she did was to complain about Mike and life in general. Finally I have to say that at the end of season 2 I lost any interest in Harvey, he seemed selfish and isolated and I could not understand his position at all.

There are few small spoons of something in the last episode of season 3, but it's pretty dumb. Everytime characters decide to do something, they actually don't do it most of the time. It's interesting how they made all characters actual filler because they have no idea how to move the plot and try to make sense with it and stuff that previously happened. I don't think I ever saw that. Adding even more dumb characters in season two and three didn't help that at all.Season 4 got greenlit somehow, apparently people are watching this, maybe. I can't wrap my head around it, the show is bad. I hatewatch it, maybe others are too.---Few episodes in of season 2 and I'm getting pretty annoyed wtih this show.Just like LOST, mysteries are piling up, but not one single resolution, hint of an answer and explanation or even a move in forward direction is presented. For Season 2, they just expanded all that by dumping much more people in it.While I can excuse first season slow burn and lack of any satisfying anwers - and I mean lack of ANY - the stuff they pulled in the last episode with various cliffhangers and possible revelations, just fell apart in episode one of this season.Almost anything that is happening is not important for the main plot. Character arcs are mostly empty, uninteresting. Those same characters act like most irrational, uninterested and dumbest people alive.Everything is tropey, boring and tempo of each episode is criminal. Just when you think something is going to happen, to propel story and plot forward - it ends. Then in the next episode it turns out it's nothing of importance and it just goes like that in circles. It's all filler.Even damn intro is lasting forever, eating time.Some shows have a overall arc that is just a backdrop for all the happenings in the show. Like Leftovers, and it works. Here however, there is really only one plot point of interest and everything else is unimportant filler and fluff. Yet they insist on that instead dealing with the main plot. Even things concerning the main plot are fed us via teaspoon in the worst, unsatisfactory way possible. Even then, time between those is pretty damn long time.I don't know if I'm going to finish season 2, but it's getting pretty frustrating. Which is a shame, because main plot is interesting, but I'm suspecting that except that main concept, they have no sensible or satisfying resolution and are just going to string us around until either show gets cancelled or we get some dumb, slapped on ending, just for the sake of ending it.For the time being, I can't recommend.",

I just think that we deserved at least a few answers before having to wait for season 3. But I've got to say that after the finale, I was mind-blown!I just hope that the creators of the show keep it at this level and why not even improve it. I'm tired of good shows getting completely messed up by creators. This one has potential. If all the questions are answered logically and interestingly, and if we get an intriguing ending which includes everybody going home, this will surely be one of the greatest shows out there.",

The director is a big problem as they do things like have the little boy get a severe leg injury. The kid isn't horrible but he can't use a crutch or limp to save his life. Not really the kids fault, he hasn't built up the coordination to do it. But how is it that episode after episode we watch him limp on the wrong leg, use the crutch on the wrong side and or leg? At some point don't you go another direction? Why couldn't the mother (who is possibly the worst actor in the show) be the one with the injury? Anyone but the kid who can't do it? Then you have the boss lady of Colony house. She somehow manages to remain angry and fat for years even though the food is 90% plants. She seems to believe that the loudest person in every situation is the correct one which is almost never the case in life. More lazy writing, everyone who ever holds a knife and gets touched or grabbed automatically spins and \"accidentally\" stabs the person behind them! This is used several times- sooooooo lazy and unlikely. The Sheriff, his son and his son's girlfriend along with the paramedic do a good job for the most part, but it's easy to see they won't ever resolve how to get home because that would be the end. They are going to milk this until it dies- the ending will either be just fading to black with no answers or a planned ending which this does not appear to have. My recommendation is to watch a few of the 1st series, then wait to see how they tie it up. Why invest yourself in a series that appears to be going nowhere?",

Making Penny fit in with all of them ended up removing the hot, dumb blonde girl around nerds effect that made the show great to begin with. Now, Penny doesn't stand out as the hot girl against the nerds because they stopped writing her like that and just made it more like Friends instead of the clashing personalities dynamic that made this show good.",

            "review": "Review of Series One:PEAKY BLINDERS has been lauded by many as the BBC's answer to the likes of US-made fare like BOARDWALK EMPIRE; it's a show chronicling life for Birmingham-based gangsters in the 1920s, and with a couple of decent actors in the leads it looks like pretty much a dead-set win. Indeed I've just heard that it's been renewed for a second series, so it must have done something right, but I'm afraid it left me utterly cold.The problem I had with the show is that it just feels so drawn-out, padded and predictable. Whole sub-plots and story lines are dragged out over six episodes when they should have been cleared up in a single episode or two maximum. The likes of GAME OF THRONES have the pacing just right so that the viewer doesn't get bored. Yes, there's merit in slow-burning atmosphere and character-building, but I just didn't like or care about anybody involved; the old Catherine Cookson adaptations of the 1990s did this sort of thing remarkably and PEAKY BLINDERS never comes close.Instead we get one clichéd scene after the next, complete with all the ridiculousness the BBC can throw at you: ultra-slow-motion in the hands of a hack director, and modern-day music to make it seem \"cool\" but which in reality takes you out of the story every time. Cillian Murphy, an actor I've loved in pretty much everything since RED EYE, is surprisingly dull and one-note; he under-plays everything to the point of monotony, and I found myself hating him for a lot of the running time. Sam Neill is excellent, but he can't account for everything, while Annabelle Wallis is vacant, seeming to think that lurking around with her mouth hanging open constitutes acting when it doesn't.Review of Series Two:The second series of PEAKY BLINDERS is a slight improvement over the first, mainly down to the ramped-up levels of gore and carnage that have clearly been included to appeal to the BOARDWALK EMPIRE and GAME OF THRONES crowd. This series concentrates on the Blinders gang's attempts to expand in the London market, with variable results.The production values are better this time around, and the production has a generally well-made air to it. Unfortunately, there are still hulking problems with it, not least the continued decision to include loud, jarring modern music to accompany the scenes. There are so many shots of characters walking in slow motion with fires or explosions in the background accompanied by this soundtrack that you feel like you're watching a music video at times. It's all very dated and mid-'90s in feel.The main problem with the show, however, is the lack of decent characterisation. The characters are one-note cardboard cut-outs throughout, and to make matters worse, none of them are sympathetic. Murphy just sits behind his desk the whole time, and Tom Hardy's scenery-chewing attempts do little to improve things. Why they brought back two used-up characters (Neill and Wallis) I don't know, because their story arcs are over and both are equally lifeless. A pivotal scene between Neill and McCrory is one of the most excruciating things I've ever sat through. It's the quality of writing that lets PEAKY BLINDERS down, and I just hope they improve on things in the next series; who knows, I might actually start enjoying it then!Review of Series Three:Sadly, series three of PEAKY BLINDERS is a step back to the disjointed nature of series one. It's even more of a case of style and substance here, and I would say that this is the most shallow series yet. For at least half of the running time it feels like one big music video, with the lazy use of loud, modern music to put across a sense of mood when really the scriptwriter should be doing that.The six episodes of this series feel remarkably busy and yet very little actually happens. There are a great deal of new characters in support, including the welcome Paddy Considine as a sinister priest, but none of them actually do very much. Murphy remains a vacuum at the centre of the show, never seeming to develop his character very much beyond the most basic elements. In fact, the only time this picks up is in the very last episode, with intense cutting between three separate story lines adding to the excitement no end. A shame the rest of the series didn't feel like this.",

            "review": "If you like Victorian crime shows like Ripper Street, Whitechapel, Sherlock Holmes etc. then you will love this. There are two differences which make Peaky Blinders stand out. The first is it isn't set in London. Why is this a good thing? It's a nice change of scene, change of accent and culture. Peaky Blinders give you a great sense of what Birmingham was like at the time. The second reason it stands out is it is told from the criminals point of view. You get a feeling of belonging to the Peaky Blinders and despite all the terrible acts they carry out there is a fundamental decency somewhere deep down in Thomas Shelby.The cinematography is great, the storyline is great the only thing I would challenge is the accents. They sway in and out of the Birmingham accent but its a decent attempt and probably unnoticeable to anyone not from Birmingham. I've heard that they didn't want the accents too strong because it will be airing in the US. Anyhow...I'm loving it!",

The priority is clearly to make everyone look cool: cool when they're engaging in brutal violence, cool when they're suffering or dying, cool when they're eating breakfast. Every shot is either like a music video or a fashion magazine spread in period costume. The characters are props - lifeless mannequins. None of them feel like actual people, nor are they meant to. The actors here are all good, but they have nothing to do but pose. We're just supposed to be dazzled by how cool they look and sound. The fact that so many viewers seem to think this show is gritty and realistic is a depressing commentary on how on we as a society can no longer tell the difference between the fake and the authentic (and how little we care about the difference). This show and others of its ilk (like the even more popular Taboo) are just nihilism photoshopped to look sexy. Superficially seductive, empty at the core.",

            "review": "Peaky Blinders is one of the most unique British dramas ever made. I would even go as far as to say TV history in the making. Negative critics of the show seem to have overlooked the fact that this is the first time ever that this side of British gangster-lore has been documented. Off hand, the only thing that comes close to this style of gangland depiction is the first half of Once Upon A Time in America, were we see the heroes struggling to escape the deprivation of ghetto life. This is where Peaky Blinders stands out from the typical run-of- the-mill crime show. There is nothing glamorous about being a gangster in this world. As far from LA Confidential glitz as you can get, the viewer is forced to get down and dirty in the horseshite-ridden streets of post WW1, working-class Birmingham.The attention to detail, the costumes, the sets, particularly the Lee family dwellings, have all been created to the highest standard. As is the quality of acting, which is undeniably as good as you'll find in any prime-time British drama.Even though people on this particular forum have not had much positive feedback about the series, believe me, the connoisseurs of this genre have been very impressed thus far. Furthermore, the show seems to be building up to climatic ending rather than simply documenting a day in the life of a Peaky Blinder. The more observant viewers will see subtle 'tie-ins' between each situation and be able to follow the flow of events without obvious prediction. This is what the drama audience thrives on to stimulate analytical debate after each episode.If it doesn't get rave reviews, I will be disappointed but not surprised, as Peaky Blinders has all the makings of an artistic and timeless cult series, possibly appealing more to purists and true fans of the cult/gangster genre. Well done BBC.",

You an clearly see the similarities with the high quality US series and they have gone for this market and there is clearly lots here that could make it a fantastic long running series.Sadly, I am concerned that the BBC won't be able to retain the quality levels and we won't see it evolve in the way that the sopranos (yes I compare this show to the sopranos and boardwalk empire) evolved. Please push this internationally, let's keep it on our screens and see it develop. This period in UK history is rich with trauma, upheaval and change, the backdrop of industrial Birmingham is new and trumps the well trodden New York, Chicago, and London gangster scenes. For writers and producers this represents very fertile ground and allows innovative story lines to emerge.Keep peaky blinders on our screens..... The campaign starts here!",

But a policeman arriving at the city is looking to stop this family, but it's not easy. It will also be noticeable the segregated fight of ghettos like Italians, gypsies, local gangsters and Jews. Peaky Blinders is an excellent gangster drama full of rich, interesting and diverse characters. The fact that Peaky Blinders is a crime series can give the impression that characters are macho men. But this is not true. The series also incorporates many powerful female characters. It has an excellent cast and script. Thomas is a character who uses his strategic intelligence and applies violence to his own ends without hesitation. The film music is the highlight of the series along with Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy. The director does resort to a modern soundtrack that reflects the fiction.It is estimated that one episode of the series is worth 1 million and 1.5 million euros. This means a rich, detailed and beautiful work of art. Constantly supporting the narrative structure visually, Peaky Blinders often touches upon the working conditions of the working class in Birmingham. Peaky Blinders, with a color scale that chooses to contrast between pale blues and greens, and contrasts with the shades of red, makes the strongest manifestation of emotions in the midst of this unknown, while attributing a distinct obscurity to Birmingham's misty air. Also, the visual effects used from time to time are quite clever. The visual effects used are also quite compatible with the historical theme of the series.Peaky Blinders makes each episode a separate action and drama. It's a breathtaking series where you can see the rise of Peaky Blinders. 9/10",

I'd heard the criticisms of the gratuitous, indie-soundtracked slow motion shots, and mumbled, breathy dialogue, but brushed them off .. Before long I'd bought the first season DVD boxset and sprouted a 1920s military haircut ... Unfortunately the sheen and style of the series wears off eventually .. About halfway through season 2, I suddenly became aware of the complete absence of any kind of compelling narrative .. Evidently things happened, but by now the monotone delivery and haircuts felt like they had nowhere to go .. I read an interview with the writer, Steven Knight, in which he boasted about how he'd already got nearly a dozen seasons written, and could reel off a script in an afternoon .. Well, great work if you can get it, but a stark contrast to the year-long team-writing process behind a single season of Breaking Bad .. Where Breaking Bad creates a narrative worthy of a Russian novel, and The Sopranos shows profound insight into the human condition, an episode of Peaky Blinders feels like 10 minutes of hastily scrawled script, padded out with brooding shots of people smoking in dark rooms, walking in slow motion, and generally loving the smell of their own farts over a one-dimensional selection of 90s and 00s indie .. In fact it's astonishing to me that an episode of The Sopranos and Peaky Blinders run to about the same length, as where each episode of The Sopranos feels like a self-contained movie; an episode of Peaky Blinders has less script than the average Jay-Z video .. All in all, a huge missed opportunity - a show that gets so much right, but fails to look beyond its own style for anything resembling a story or character development.",

Nominally the head of the family is the oldest brother, Arthur, but the real brains, ambition and drive in the organisation lies with Tommy, the second oldest. He will carve out an empire for himself that will stretch beyond Birmingham. This with the aid of his family and his gang, the Peaky Blinders.Superb drama, created and written by Steven Knight. Gritty, realistic, intriguing and highly entertaining. Some great machinations, subterfuges, plots and counter-plots plus a good amount of action and human drama. Think The Sopranos set in the UK in 1919.Some very clever storylines and plot developments. They sometimes threaten to become implausible and random (especially as the series goes on) but have a way of fitting together and all making sense at the end.Great work by the main performers: Cillian Murphy, Helen McCrory, Paul Anderson, Sophie Rundle and Joe Cole. The secondary/guest performances include some big names: Sam Neill, Tom Hardy, Aiden Gillen, Adrien Brody, Noah Taylor. Tom Hardy is the pick of the bunch, as Alfie Solomons.Great soundtrack too. Though set in the early-20th century, the music is mostly rock, and it works. Despite being anachronistic, the music works, giving the series an edgy feel. It starts with the theme track - Nick Cave's excellent 'Red Right Hand', a song that seems to fit Tommy Shelby perfectly. It continues with the scene-specific music and includes some great tracks. For example, in one episode alone you have Radiohead's 'Climbing Up The Walls', Joy Division's 'Atmosphere' and Black Sabbath's 'War Pigs'.In addition, the show went out on a high, while it was still quality viewing. By Season 5 cracks were starting to appear: the plot in Season 5 was a bit loose and unfocused and ends rather clumsily, compared to previous seasons. Still great, but not as good as previous seasons and a sign that it had run its course.The worry then was that Steven Knight would just phone it in for a few seasons to milk more money out of it and just end up ruining the legacy of the show. However, Season 6 is a great finale: focused, short and sharp, wrapping things up in style.",

Add to that shots of characters parading into a room, with an air that they are the coolest people alive, like a teen given better clothes and a better hair cut on the first day of school - that is also really trying my patience. If I were asked what character recently portrayed on film annoyed me most I'd have a hard time thinking of anyone else but Arthur; if I was a Peaky Blinder I'd shoot him myself. But this is perhaps due to a good character, played by a good actor, that is irritating. Above all though, the vast majority of the music irritates me; could they not blend music of the time while retaining Nick Cave's intro and randomly chosen outros? Or how about the cliche parts where Tom never meets a woman that isn't ready to drop their panties for him - is this something that was borrowed from that awful show Entourage? And so, my struggle to get through season five goes forward. I've gone from a 9/10 at the end of season three, to a 7/10, and now to a 6/10. Wish me luck. Season six? No thanks.",

Firstly that we're not being overlooked for London, Manchester or Liverpool, and we're being allowed our own history, which is interesting and colourful.At first glance the downstairs of the Shelby house looks too big to be the ground floor of a terrace, and people seem to be using their front doors far too often which, since there seems to be a significant amount of 'respect' being shown and rules being followed, it irks me that this protocol's being ignored. That said, it does look better to have the character using the front door.My other issue is accents. In fairness, for the most part people are doing an amazing job - most real Brummy accents do not sound like the caricature most people think of, and this is being respected by the actors with only the occasional slip... except for Aunt Polly. Helen McCrory is a fine actress - a mistress of the Brummy accent she isn't. Her performance is making up for it however.The Jamaiacan preacher amused me; as pointed out by another reviewer this actor is Benjamin Zephaniah: B'ham local and poet. Jamaica did send help over for WWI, so it's not impossible that several men stayed. He is a wonderful reminder that Birmingham has always been a hub for migration - even more so after WWII.Sam Neill's performance is amazing.So far the series is not just telling an interesting story, it's telling elements of Brummagem's history and present in a subtle and interesting way.

This is a poor mans csi and although it's shot beautifully that's about all I can say for it. Titus welliver is a good actor, but he must have cringed at some of this dialogue. I would hope that amazon keeps trying in this field, but they should find an honest way of getting reviews out to prime members.",

It tells the story of a former special forces officer named Harry Bosch (Titus Welliver), who's now a homicide detective in Hollywood. He inspects suspicious deaths and is absolutely relentless in his pursuit of the truth. Titus Welliver is absolutely perfect as Harry Bosch! It went on for seven incredible seasons and the fans loved it so much that they brought it back already with Bosch: Legacy, which is just as good.

Many posted their review after only having seen the \"promising\" pilot. Nevertheless, I gave it a chance.Having finished the season I have to conclude however that Bosch was a disappointment. This results mainly from the wooden acting by Titus Welliver, the all-too-simple plot which you have seen a million times before in standard TV cop shows and also and the weak script which contains almost no character development.The show felt flat and never really made me care for the characters or the story. If you really want to see a great police series, go watch \"The Wire\" (10/10), \"True Detective\" (10/10) or maybe \"The Killing\" (9/10), but stay away from \"Bosch\" unless you have too much time.

Seven seasons might seem long but every season has new cases and so it doesn't feel repetitive. It could have been going on for much more seasons if you ask me as the quality of the seasons remained equal. I have to say it's not the easiest show to follow. For that there is sometimes too much going on, which is not necessarily a bad thing but you have to be very attentive all the time. Also the use of slang and police lingo isn't always the easiest thing to understand if you're not familiar with it. That said Bosch is just quality. The cast is just perfect, all actors are very believable in their roles, the stories are addictive to follow, so yes I'm sad Bosch is finished. I guess they stopped because of the so-called pandemic, I can't see no other reason, as this show was always entertaining, even in the end.",

Acting is great and can't wait to see his characters and stories transferred to the silver screen. Titus Welliver, who plays an LAPD homicide detective, is just the right choice of actor that one imagines when reading Connelly's books, he could have stepped right off the page! The scene settings around LA make me want to go back and visit all the places i missed on my holiday there! My only criticism of this pilot is that stories from 3 books were used to weave into one story about a serial killer. One book can stand on its own but I understand the logic of immediately trying to capture the audience in this pilot. I really recommend this series to viewers who enjoy a good who \"dunnit!\"",

What a delight to find the familiar names from the book given faces.I only have a slight complaint and that it that the first episode is a little cliché with some of its \"bad\" guys, but given that this is a pilot I'm more than willing to overlook a little heavy handedness. I feel that this will be overcome as the series develops (go back and watch some of your favorite on going program and you'll find that a lot of them are like this).Overall I really liked the pilot and am anticipating the rest of the series.(just a little fan girl moment when I saw Angel's Flight!)",

Titus has a great voice but unfortunately there is no narration in the series. He must have thoughts. Mike Hammer did and Bosch definitely had some Mike in him.

Good job on his house on the hill looking down on LA and keeping true to his love of jazz. Great background music. In the books, Harry does not drop the \"F\" bomb like you are doing in this episode. I hope that quits because Michael Connolly wrote with many more words and expressions other than the repeated use of the bomb. Good stories do not need to be inundated with vulgarity. Yes, he did use it on occasion, but only on occasion. Some of the dialog was low and difficult to follow so I will have to watch it again. I read both books, The Concrete Blonde and City of Bones and I am fascinated that the pilot should be a combination of the stories. I am assuming that should the series continue then they will fork off and get more into depth. Each story was very good, especially The Concrete Blonde. I like the idea that Michael Connolly is hands-on with this production so the integrity of his books is maintained. Like I stated earlier, I think the writers can deliver more dialog without resorting to vulgarity so much. I realize that these are cops and the language can get rough, but Connolly gets the toughness across without the constant use of vulgarity. Sorry if I keep on that same theme, but honestly, that is my biggest complaint for the pilot. Otherwise, I would have rated it a 10.",

I was in a way wondering if I was just wasting my time and watching a series that would fall short of everyone's expectations and just flop, like so many other TV series do nowadays. However, that didn't happen at all.The performances were outstanding in my opinion. Martin Freeman was excellent and to my surprise did the accent fairly well. Billy Bob Thornton was amazing as Lorne Malvo, the enigmatic vibe you get from his performance gave me chills.The cinematography is also one of the good things about this pilot. The shots are smart and intriguing, yet still simple and not too overdone. The music is also outstanding. There are times when it is quirky and funny, there are times where it is tragic and sad yet epic, and then there are also the times when it is intense and mysterious.Fargo is mysterious, intense, funny (at times), tragic and just simply plain awesome!

So far, the only thing the series and the film do have in common is the title and the (fake) premise that both are - allegedly - based on true events that happened somewhere in Minnesota.The writers (and the actors!) do a great job in creating new characters that are as strange and somewhat over the top as most of the iconic Coen creations we've come to love over the years - and Billy Bob Thornton's 'Lorne Malvo' (from season 01) has the potential to reach cult status. Watching bad situations get worse as bad decisions lead to even worse ones and the lives of ordinary people spiral violently out of control is - I shamefully admit - a lot of fun to watch, and it's told here with such a wicked sense of humor that I've so far enjoyed every minute of it.The cast so far has been outstanding (this is an anthology series, so each new season will have its own cast and a new storyline) and the production values - especially the cinematography - are fantastic. Now whether 'Fargo' will appeal to a larger audience despite its quirky characters and non-mainstream look the way a show like 'Breaking Bad' did remains to be seen, but I would strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys black comedies in general as well as pretty much anything the Coens ever did.

The quiet menacing look he gives and the relaxed confident way in which he moves about town, slowly pulling all the strings, making everyone dance to his tune. His devil may care attitude, and that smile of his. He deserves an Emmy for sure.Allison Tolman plays the slightly overweight (but not pregnant) cop and she nails it. Ditto for Martin Freeman as Nester and Colin Hanks as Gus. I have been a fan of Martin since i first saw him in Sherlock. He has that quintessence that has almost vanished from modern Hollywood. He can play the vulnerable every-man very well, but I am feel that his character will grow in this series into something more sinister.Anyways, enough from me.

While, at least 5 episodes are a full 10/10 for me, the finale failed to spark.Starting off with strict references to the 1996 film, it talks about a psychopath who is on a mission in another city, played charismatically by Billy Bob Thornton. I loved his air & nuanced performance. Then comes Martin Freeman, out of the neighborhood Sherlock sets, as that jittery underachiever who has a nagging wife. Things start to climb up when Freeman's character bumps into his high-school friend. Next, he meets Thornton's character & boom! What follows is an interwoven plot which refers the original film.Crime has been brilliantly showcased in this series, including the finale and that is the main point. What follows next is as horrendous as the last minutes of the film. One after another, the thrills catch up with our heart's pumping pace as the characters grow out of their shells and reveal grave, suppressed expressions. It reflects human psychology brilliantly and in just the last 20 minutes. We feel sad, funny, pity, excited - for the images on- screen are brilliantly written. Music is very supportive.Yes, this is better than the complex True Detective. It is hard-hitting, folks and what more could a dark crime plot ask for a setup than Minnesota. Noah Hawley writes with his brain open and succeeds in making a point or two. His tale is driven my 2014's best background score. If you doubt that, try searching Google for the \"Mr. Numbers & Mr. Wrench\" track and you will see how nuts is the web for the music.BOTTOM LINE: I was skeptical after the first episode but now I am positive.

In Season 1 an insurance salesman accidentally hires a hitman to kill the man who has been bullying him all his life. In Season 2 a covered-up hit-and-run has major repercussions. In Season 3 a family feud over a stamp leads to a case of mistaken identity and several murders. In Season 4 two crime gangs feud over territory.Brilliant...for the first two seasons. I was initially sceptical of this series, thinking it was just a serialised version of the Coen Brothers' superb film of the same name. Turns out it's not, but it does have a lot in common with the movie, and this is a good thing.Creator Noah Hawley manages to capture the atmosphere and central concept of the movie without copying the movie. The plots are different to the movie but have the same pattern: a minor incident/decision that, through misunderstanding and bad luck, escalates into something massive, involving multiple murders. There's the white, cold visual aspect to the movie (being set in Minnesota in winter) which leads to a brooding, desolate feel to the series. Plus, there's the dark Coenesque humour. All this, without the Coens having any creative input into the series: they're executive producers, and nothing more.This was especially true in Season 1. The season was so true to the feel of the movie I was sure the Coen brothers had a major hand in it (they didn't). Add in a superb performance by Billy Bob Thornton as the psychopathic Lorne Malvo and Season 1 was off-the-charts brilliant.Season 2 was less intriguing than Season 1 and had a less-tight plot, but had more action. It builds up to this action though and the pacing is superb, building like an avalanche. The last few episodes are absolutely frenetic and riveting. While largely an independent season, the links to characters in Season 1 make this even more interesting. Only downside: the UFOs. They seemed rather gimmicky, added nothing to the story and didn't help the tightness of the plot.Season 3 marked the down-turn of the series. It has some good passages of play, some interesting characters and a wonderful tie-in with Season 1 but is definitely not in the same league as the first two seasons. The plot is far-fetched, truly testing the series' \"This is a true story\" line. Quite clumsy and disjointed at times, with sub-plots that add nothing except to take up time, a cartoonish villain (and one of the most dentally-unhygienic characters of all time) and plot developments that don't always make sense.It also feels a bit unoriginal: the \"police officer who sees the full picture but is hindered by the incompetence of their boss\" angle was covered in Season 1.Throw in some David Lynch-like sequences (often involving Ray Wise, who starred in Twin Peaks) and the season has a style-over-substance feel to it.Overall, Season 3 is watchable but is a major disappointment after Seasons 1 and 2.Season 4 is even worse. It started well enough, with an interesting and intriguing setup, but the writers clearly didn't know where to take everything. There's far too many characters and sub-plots and the pace is pedestrian, resulting in an unfocused, meandering, seemingly interminable season.The writers' keenness to draw things out and lack of ideas is no more demonstrated in Episode 9, an episode that closes off one sub-plot but takes an entire episode to do it when the actual substance of the episode would have taken at most 10 minutes. Plus they throw in heaps of Coenisms to appear reverential and arty and appeal to fans of the original Fargo when all they are doing is padding out the episode. It's also quite ironic, as Season 4 feels nothing like the original film, the remainder of the series or a Coen Brothers production. It's not even set in Minnesota!Season 4 is also not helped by Chris Rock being cast in the lead role. He's a decent comedic actor but here lacked the gravitas for the role.When Season 5 was released I was first surprised that I existed, as it had been three years since S4, and then hesitant to watch it, figuring the show had had its day. When I did watch it I was pleasantly surprised. The season is a decent return to form with much of what made the movie, S1 and S2 back: the intelligence , humour, Coenesque plot, characters and dialogue. Plus, the casting and performances have lifted with Juno Temple being quite the revelation in the lead role.It's not perfect though: the Minnesotan folksiness is overdone, some of the characters are cartoonish and there's a fair bit of filler, largely in the middle episodes. Still, at least it looks like the show is roughly on the right track after losing its way for two seasons.Season ratings: Season 1 10/10 (can I go full Spinal Tap and give this an 11/10?

From then on I couldn't forget it, I missed it. I started watching several shows later, but nothing came close to BB. I went on a search for such exciting crime dramas and then I saw few people on reddit talk about Narcos and Fargo (most of them) to experience something similar. At first, I googled them and decided to watch Narcos as Google knowledge graph mentions Fargo as a comedy series. So, yeah Narcos was enthralling, but didn't really feel 10/10 especially with too much Spanish. Then I decided to give a try on Fargo and boy oh boy! It's simply sensational.Season 1: The first episode itself left me exuberant. This Martin Freeman guy, right from the day I saw him as Bilbao Baggins, everything he does impresses me and in Fargo there's nothing less. And the others were excellent too, especially Billy Bob Throtton, that man is really one hell of an actor. He is an assassin, every scene of him is jaw dropping with some chills. All in all, Season 1 of Fargo was really the one I was waiting for these whole 6 months and I didn't want to end this beautiful experience, so I immediately decided to watch Season 2.Season 2: Everyone who watched season 1 will have some idea about how season 2 will go on. It opened off very well and the first episode here too ends dramatically. The next 2 episodes were slow-paced and I thought this might turn out like True Detective Season 2 as it couldn't really recreate the magic of the first season (just my opinion). So, right when I thought it's sinking, it just gets better and better from episode 4. There won't be a moment you could take your eyes off till the last minute of the season finale. I'm glad they renewed it for the next season and I really can't wait for that.The music utilized over the two seasons is absolutely mind blowing, the way it relates to each and every scenario is just spectacular. Along with this awesome music, the outstanding piece of poetry depicts the ongoing lives of the people in Fargo. The direction part is really masterful and you can clearly see that in the second season\". It has few flaws but if you're just looking for some real piece of art then Fargo is a must watch.Update: Ok, it's sad to say that this amazing show went downhill later.

He's always Chris Rock saying lines somebody wrote for him to say.\nThis isn't the movie Grown Ups, or Good Hair, this is a serious show with heavy drama, Midwest racial history and a delivered at slow pace - you need real actors to suck the audience in so we care so much about the characters we're anxious to see what happens to them next.\nI gave it two episodes, but near the end of the second episode I felt like I was enduring the show, not enjoying it. So I'm out - hopefully Season 5 gets back to using great character actors.",

The script has a mean spirited edge and there seems to be a real lack of motivation behind the numerous murders, unless they're planning on going 'back' to unearth why some of these seemingly rash decisions are being made. Additionally there's some real over-acting going on with dialogue that has a tendency to be self-consciously trite and devoid of humor - or at least dismally failing at raising a laugh.

Sometimes it's even stupid, thinking that making one of the characters fart and throw up is going to inject some humor. Is this humor written by a 5 year old? Even my son finds fart jokes ridiculous. The acting is bad. Chris Rock is like a zombie and the big Italian actor who plays Gaetano over acts every scene with his ridiculous eye rolls. It's impossible to connect to any of the characters, they're just too many of them and no time to do a character introduction and build up.

This is an anthology series that was inspired by the 1996 film where each season follows a new murder story in some Midwest town with a different cast every season. It has the same feel, style, dark humor, unpredictability, etc as the film did. It has the feel of the Coen brothers but creator Noah Hawley definitely puts his own stamp on it.

He is even less believable as a potential love interest. He appears to me to be asexual. Every time he is supposed to play a love interest he comes across as more of a platonic friend than a sexual being capable of romancing a women into bed.This movie is saved by Byrne, but it's not enough. There are very few laughs here, and laughing and mugging for the camera does not guarantee that the viewers will be laughing along.

The first three episodes that launched today are super relaxing and a perfect way to kick your feet up after a long day at work! The only complaint would be that the supporting characters don't really have much of a voice at the moment and I suppose that's perfectly fine as the main focus is on the dynamic between the two leads.

If you're not into the Seth Rogen brand of humour you might actually be surprised by this performance which shows a more mature Seth Rogen who's still able to pull out some genuinely funny moments of comedy when necessary. In terms of exploration of adulthood, don't expect anything too deep but everything is flowing so smoothly that I ended up watching one episode after the other over two days.Will (Seth Rogen) just got out of a divorce and is a owner of a brewery while Sylvia (Rose Byrne) is a stay-at-home mom of three kids who's clearly bored with her life, they both end up reconnecting after spending a few years apart. It's a light and entertaining Friday night watch with some good performances all-around. When Rose Byrne channels her inner comedic side she can be effortlessly hilarious and it's almost as if Seth Rogen brings out the best of her which allows her to unleash her wild side.I got attach to them pretty quickly thanks also to the writing which is not flashy but can be clever at times. It wins you over with the smaller moments that speaks volume. Maybe it's because I just hit my 30's or maybe it's because I always liked Seth Rogen, but this resonated with me without saying I was emotionally moved by the series it does get you hooked with the blend of drama and comedy, all thanks to Byrne and Rogen's charms and wits.I just think this works without being special or ground-breaking, it immediately becomes some sort of comfort food. In some ways, this might've benefited from the whole season dropping the same day but the first three episodes will be releasing on May 24th. It might lose some people along the way with the week-to-week format. By the end of the series, I was a bit underwhelmed by the finale, it left me wanting more.

Your reaction to this show will depend almost entirely on your Seth Rogen-tolerance level. Full disclosure: I am a fan. Through the late noughties and early 2010s he contributed immensely to a handful of film comedies that defined the era. However, Rogen as a petulant man-child in cargo pants and flip-flops in his 20s may have been amusing, but a fortysomething with THAT demeanour, in THAT wardrobe and with THAT laugh? Torturous.Also, what in the name of Dick Van Dyke's Chirpee Cockernee is going on with Rose Byrne's accent?! It flies back and forth between the northern and southern hemispheres more often than a disorientated swallow. Her unwillingness to face any of the issues in her life and her infantile behaviour with her husband's co-workers almost allow her to surpass Rogen on the unlikeability scale.I found it impossible to root for these characters.

Philosophers have long debated the moral implications of \"many universes\" ( while realizing it's a bit sophomoric and nerdy ) ; \"Rick and Morty\" picks at this as its stock in trade. Morty is our avatar, and works in that capacity extremely well.The essential dyad at the center - the title characters - interact little with the more peripheral characters, who have mainly been used in B plots. This shifts of course, and with these sorts of shows they will always mix this for plot gain. There's a rich enough set of characters to provide ample space. The interaction between Rick and Morty hoists a bit from classic propaganda tropes without actually being propagandist; a heck of a trick. It must be hard to calibrate this.The entire show is just chock full of nuggets and neither preaches nor deigns to condescend to the audience. Pacing is always even and feels right. The writers know where to push and where not to.We will see how long this can be maintained. The writers show a gift for twisting & adding-to old plots into new shows.

Its not pretty and seems out dated. Despite this, its hard to say that this pulls the show down. No, not even one bit. The absolutely clever writing and well designed character personalities are basically what this show floats upon.Unlike many other cartoons that have a sub plot in every episode, the ones in this show are actually relevant and memorable.

Morty, his dog Snuffles, and even Morty's math teacher all pack in great jokes. The directing is great and the art style and the way it is drawn is really really good. The only problem I have with the show, is that I don't really think they know how to end each episode (so far at least). But, this is truly a breath of fresh air when it comes to comedy, and I think adultswim has a really good show on their hands... 9/10",

Together they go on wild other-dimensional adventures.I had high hopes for this series. It is very highly rated on IMDB (currently #12 in their Top 250 TV Series) and the humour seemed offbeat and absurdist - just the way I like it.So much for that.Unfortunately it is absurd without there really being any thought behind it. Monty Python were so funny because, while their humour seemed so outrageously bizarre and unreal, there was clearly a lot of thought behind it. The humour poked fun at everyday customs and often circled back for a fantastic punchline.Rick and Morty, on the other hand, is absurd in an unplanned, chaotic sort of way. It's just a random walk with no big punchline. Not clever and just silliness for the sake of it.There are some funny moments, so it's not a total waste but not worth waiting for amongst all the dull, nonsensical stuff that goes on.",

            "review": "Here are the reasons Rick and Morty is one of the worst shows on TV right now.First off, the \"comedy\". If you market your show as a \"comedy\", you should at least have funny jokes. Is an old man belching and abusing his grandson and a teenager stammering really that funny? Maybe it's the juvenile dick and fart jokes that are made every five seconds. Is it because there are pop culture references? Pop culture references don't make something good. Even if you get the references being made, that's still no excuse to give something a pass because it's too lazy to come up with its own jokes so it references something that's already been made and hopes the audience gets the reference. The show's target audience isn't even old enough to get the references, so why do they even bother anyway?This brings me to another point. From what I've heard, a large portion of the show is improvised, to the point where the show's writers work the episodes' scripts around it. Improvisation is not only something that is better in small doses but also really, REALLY hard to get people laughing while doing it. If you're someone like Robin Williams (R.I.P.), then you can do that with no problems (i.e. Aladdin). The problem is that Justin Roiland, who voices both of the titular characters, is not good enough. The fact that the script is worked around his... let's just say lackluster improv only serves to bring down what should be a really funny episode. There are two episodes that are almost entirely improv, and they are among the least funny episodes of the show I've watched.Second, the show has horrendous character design. Each and every (human) character has inhumanly skinny torsos and large heads, I assume because none of them properly neotenized. The alien characters have varying designs, but there is so much variety that it seems like the show's creators wanted to put \"weird\" creatures into the show just for the weirdness value.Third, the show tries to be \"edgy\" by being an existentialist drama, but it just comes off as being preachy and stupid. Now, I'm not saying that existentialist dramas can't be good; in fact, when they're done right, they can really make you think. Rick and Morty doesn't do that. Whenever it's done, I'm always reminded of the end of every modern Family Guy episode where one of the characters gives a big, heartfelt speech acknowledging their mistakes before being welcomed back into the family so that they can repeat the process next week.I usually try not to judge the quality of a series based on its fanbase, but, by GOD, the Rick and Morty fanbase is giving the Steven Universe fanbase a run for its money. The Rick and Morty fanbase only exists to spout out the trite and unfunny quotes that come from the show en masse and on repeat like a broken record. A good portion of them also treat Rick and Morty like it's some god-tier show and act all high and mighty towards anyone that doesn't watch it, and wonder if there's something wrong with you if you don't like it.It's hard not to notice the similarities between this show and Futurama, which also had a sci-fi theme and plenty of nerdy stuff while still managing to be both hilarious and heartwarming. I mean, who DIDN'T cry at the episode about Fry's dog?As I'm writing this, I came up with a theory for why this show is so popular. It's because it's an adult swim show. Now, anyone who's familiar with adult swim knows that many of its shows are stinkers. It's not like Rick and Morty is up against stiff competition when compared to other adult swim programs like Mr. Pickles, Robot Chicken, Squidbillies, and Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell.Now, there are some good things about the show. The animation is clean and consistent (but that doesn't mean that I like the character design, because, as I mentioned earlier, I don't). Chris Parnell does a good job of playing his character from Archer. There was one joke in the episode where dogs take over the world that made me laugh, but, looking back on it, it's not really that funny of a joke. But believe me when I say that the negatives far outweigh the positives.I've watched about ten episodes of this show. Those ten episodes were all I needed in order to stay away from it. Please, do yourself a favor and never watch it, ever.",

It'S one of those shows that wouldn't happen to be without Adult Swim. Not exactly a family show. Anyways - this show is brilliant. The humor is not as cheap as in most of the successful cartoons and the show is not as comfortable to watch, but that's one thing that makes it so hilarious. It's really dark sometimes, and the viewer with a good sense of humor will appreciate that. The only thing that might make the show a bit better is that the creators could make the characters a bit better known and thus more likable to the viewer. Like this a plot as in episode 6 (SE1) would work even better. Well, the characters maybe a bit flat still, but the plots and happenings are making all this acceptable. Amazingly funny and thoughtful story line for a 20min cartoon show. The sad part is, that it might not really be for the rank and file and as a result might not last for too long or even be recognized by too many people.

Despite often having a fast-pace you could still follow what was going on, and feel invested. You'd wonder how Rick & Morty would save the day, and be impressed by how things turned out. There's even strong moments of drama and pathos, and a promising mythology build-up with Citadel of Ricks, Evil Morty etc. All 30 eps are worth watching. 9/10.Seasons 4-5 are a pale shadow: it's lost the intelligence, the wit and the depth. It's ditched the mythology, recycles ideas and replaced dramatic pathos with school-level family drama. Rick has gone from being one of the great cartoon characters to becoming a dull self-aware Deus Ex Machina tool (even meta-referencing this during one S5 ep...that's not smart, that just highlights how lazy the writing has become). Flanderization has affected the other characters too, All the show's got left is being weird, and upping the hectic up to 11...it's way too fast-paced, as a viewer it's just painful to follow now. From the 16 eps so far of Seasons 4 & 5 there's two, maybe three eps worth watching...a shockingly poor return, and frankly a waste of my time now. 3/10.Watch the first three seasons and pretend it ended then.",

            "review": "\"The Waterfront,\" from the prolific mind of Kevin Williamson, dives headfirst into the murky waters of a North Carolina fishing dynasty forced into illicit activities. While it clearly aims to capture the dark, family-centric crime drama vibes of \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Ozark,\" viewers might find themselves adrift in a narrative that prioritizes rapid-fire character introductions and convoluted plot twists over coherent storytelling. This isn't a measured, character-driven descent into the criminal underworld; it's a messy, often frantic, dive.The series immediately establishes the Buckley family's desperation as their once-proud fishing empire teeters on the brink of collapse. Patriarch Harlan (Holt McCallany) and his determined wife Belle (Maria Bello) find themselves pulled back into a world of drug smuggling, largely due to their son Cane's (Jake Weary) initial botched foray into it. However, the show's unique-and arguably frustrating-ability to have characters \"pop up left, right, and center\" without adequate prior explanation creates a disorienting experience. Past events are frequently alluded to but rarely clarified, leaving viewers constantly asking \"who is who, why, when, and where\" well into the second episode. This can make it incredibly difficult to connect with any specific character's motivations or truly grasp the stakes of the immediate situation.Unlike the meticulously crafted character arcs and tight plotting of \"Breaking Bad\" or the strategic brilliance of \"Ozark,\" \"The Waterfront\" feels less sophisticated. The characters, while certainly flawed and driven by desperation, often lack the nuanced depth that would make their actions truly resonate. Their decisions frequently feel impulsive and less like the calculated moves of individuals navigating a treacherous criminal landscape, leading to a sense of dramatic convenience rather than organic development.Yet, \"The Waterfront\" is not without its chaotic charm. It embraces its \"Southern-fried gothic\" identity with gusto, offering a steady diet of betrayals, shocking violence, and high-octane melodrama. Think less \"prestige TV\" and more \"nighttime soap opera with a body count.\" The production values are slick, showcasing the picturesque yet equally foreboding North Carolina coastline. Topher Grace, in particular, stands out as Grady, a tech-bro interloper who brings an almost jarring, yet undeniably entertaining, energy to the proceedings.Ultimately, \"The Waterfront\" is a show that prioritizes relentless action and constant surprises over a clear, easily digestible narrative. If you're looking for a meticulously plotted crime drama that rewards careful attention to detail, you might find yourself frustrated. However, if you're in the mood for a fast-paced, often outrageous, and undeniably bingeable ride through a family's desperate struggle to survive in a morally ambiguous world, even if it means sacrificing some narrative clarity, \"The Waterfront\" just might keep you hooked - despite its rough edges. It's a wild, often messy, but undeniably entertaining trip to the dark side of the Outer Banks.",

Melissa Benoist and Gerardo Celasco deserve some credit; their performances are the only watchable aspect. They do their best to carry the drama, but the script works against them. Everything else is slow, dull, and poorly staged. The pacing drags, the conflicts fall flat, and the storytelling lacks momentum. The one redeeming quality is the visual presentation.

He's blessed with an incredibly beautiful wife and daughter and he takes it for granted. Jake must grit his teeth on occasion having to portray such a demeaning character.

The story is solid - nothing crazy original, but it's got that classic crime drama vibe that's just kinda satisfying to watch.The ending? Not gonna lie, it didn't blow my mind, but it tied things up nicely without feeling rushed or annoying. You get some closure on the main plot, and a few loose ends left to keep you thinking. I like that balance.The vibe reminds me a bit of Boardwalk Empire or Peaky Blinders - moody, gritty, with a lot of tension and some slick cinematography. Definitely not a happy-go-lucky show, so if you want light stuff, skip it. But if you're into slow-burning crime drama with some cool character moments, it's your jam. Actors did their thing, no huge Hollywood names, but everyone felt natural and believable. The lead was especially good at playing that tough but kinda broken dude. No overacting or cheesy lines, which I appreciated.Would I recommend it? Yeah, if you like crime dramas and want something chill to watch. It's not the best thing ever, but it's solid and entertaining. Just don't expect some groundbreaking story or crazy plot twists.So yeah, my personal score would be around a 7/10.

Based on the real-life work of forensic anthropologist and novelist Kathy Reichs, it's fun, kicky, and only occasionally too gruesome to look at. Not quite like one of Ms. Reichs' novels, it is still a pleasure for a fan (me!) to watch. Boreanaz' past work on Buffy and Angel stands in good stead here as he delivers lines that stand up to a strong female role without diminishing it. Also like Buffy, humor lends grace to embarrassing social situations that highlight common human vulnerabilities. Surrounding the 2 major players are other characters who add to the thrust of a character driven show. The writers do good work giving each character unique attributes that have nothing to do with hair color or body measurements. The entire cast does a good job presenting real, quirky individuals who don't have to rely on looks to sell the worth of their character to the viewers. That alone is something new for any CSI show. Still some rough edges in writing and delivery (Tempe's \"I wish this was the worst I have seen\" was painful for all the wrong reasons),\"Bones\" has great potential.",

            "review": "Here is a show that is refreshingly real, from characters to plots, while intellectually stimulating, and willing to tickle our funny bone.Dr. Temperance 'Bones' Brennan (Emily Deschanel) is a smart, focused, professional woman whose sensitivities are not so far from the surface that she is hard, or hardened by avoiding them, nor so close to the surface that she is weak, or weakened by them. She is serious, candid and forthright. Her ability to \"handle\" herself stems from confidence and experience, not tragedy or pathology as is so often the case in TV-land female characters.Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) could be a hardened, tough guy, stereotypical character. He is not. While we are reminded regularly of his past as a military sniper, the sensitivity he brings to his duties as an FBI agent redeem his past actions, as is his hope. Make no mistake, he is a fierce patriot and proud FBI man, yet his character's motives and motivation are clear and noble. They are never fanatically righteous or overbearingly macho.These two characters are wonderfully balanced with each other: their approach to life, to their work, to the pursuit of this week's mystery. Their relationship rings true. Through agreements, disagreements and the sense of humor it takes to weather both, Deschanel and Boreanaz always deliver the wry portrayal these two staunchly serious, but genuinely human characters deserve. Each character's work is expertly accomplished and equally important to the solutions they unravel together. As audience, we enjoy their working together. Temperance Brennan and Seeley Booth are a great team - as are Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz.With these two very real 21st Century individuals, and stories that skillfully incorporate forensic anthropology, both as it is used in the discipline of anthropology to understand the most ancient of artifacts, and as it is used in the most modern criminal labs, the foundation is strong for TV entertainment of the highest kind. But, it isn't only the charisma of the two main characters or their portrayers that keeps the show real, believable, compelling. Dr. Brennan's support team at the lab are a fine crew (Michaela Conlin as Angela Montenegro - forensic artist and friend to Dr. Brennan, Eric Millegan as Zack Addy - genius, geeky, naively lovable forensic anthropologist in-training, T.J. Thyne as Dr. Jack Hodgins - soil, bug and all-things-creepy expert, and Jonathan Adams as Dr. Daniel Goodman - administrator/anthropologist and the lab crew's boss). Each has an expertise that is technically viable and each is well portrayed by the actors cast. It all adds up to a TV show you can't wait to see again next week!",

Also, an autopsy shows that the corpse's neck has been wrung, like a chicken's. Bones and Booth trace the corpse to a chicken farm, which is being picketed by hipster protesters chanting, \"Cluck you, cluck you.\" Here they learn that the victim developed his chicken-like face when the farm's chicken stench caused his nasal passages to become deformed. Then, they probably solve the case. I don't know. I couldn't finish watching. I've never made it more than halfway through an episode. Not for lack of trying.I don't remember exactly, but the chicken episode may be the same one in which the corpse is found by a troop of girl scouts who carefully preserve it and transport it to the FBI lab on their scout bus, with the consent of their scout leader. And let me tell you, the realism left me feeling refreshed.The above plot description might make it sound like this is an inspired, surreal parody of cop shows, but it isn't. If this was parody, I'd expect the actors to play it completely deadpan. Instead, they're trying to be so cute and precious that we just want to eat them up.There's Bones -- whose level of social awkwardness is wildly inconsistent, depending on which writer is phoning in the gags -- and Booth, her thoroughly bland boss, and a group of thirteen year old boys disguised as lab technicians. One of these guys is named \"Sweets,\" which alone is enough to push this show from annoying to intolerable.There's also a slutty girl (Angela, I think her name is?) who has no identifiable function other than letting us know every six minutes that she's been sleeping around. How this advances the plot in any way is beyond me. Maybe it all comes together in the second half of the episodes, when I'm not watching.The only unique aspect of \"Bones\" is the shockingly grotesque corpses. Now, if the rest of the show was as grotesque -- if these corpses were put into any sort of appropriate context, that is -- it would be one of the darkest, most compelling shows on television. Instead, we are treated to the bizarre spectacle of these hideous, decaying bodies that look like they're from the set of a Lucio Fulci movie displayed in brightly-lit rooms while childish actors poke at them and flirt with each other against sparkly background music. It's one of the weirdest things I've ever seen, but it's not funny or interesting at all. It's unwatchable.0/10.",

The addition of David Boreanaz also was a big draw, as he is a very charismatic actor(and I adored Angel!) For fans of Ms Reichs books, this is a slightly odd amalgam of Kathy herself and her main character Temperance Brennan, who on the show is also a crime author (like Ms Reichs - a top forensic anthropologist and author.)The characters are all new, apart from Brennan's ex-husband Pete (although we only got a glimpse of him in the season premiere) plus it is set in Washington DC rather than Canada and Virginia as in the books.Tempe herself is rather different than the book character. Emily Deschanel is fine, but rather young and headstrong compared to the book Tempe. Even in the one episode, we have seen her rushing into things quite recklessly. I guess they wanted to make her a little more dynamic for TV.The chemistry between Brennan and Booth (Boreanaz) was pretty good from the start, although they need to handle it properly. Maybe the Mulder and Scully reference is a hint of how they might handle things. However, the crime was a little flimsy. This first episode seemed to focus far more on establishing character and tone than on plot. Probably something that will change with future episodes.On the whole, Riechs fans can have fun being snooty and complaining about Tempe's drinking and the lack of her cat, but I thought the show had definite possibilities.

Despite what people might have thought of David Boreanaz's acting abilities, by starring in Bones he has proved that he is a well rounded actor whom can take any role and make it his own. The rest of the cast has been perfectly selected to bounce of David and make the show the best there can be. Also i am impressed with how Emily has turned out as an actor, in the first few episodes i thought she was a bit of a hollow actress, kind of carboardy, but i have since been proved very wrong and feel bad for terrible of how quick i judged her. I can only hope than this show continues to be made for a least another couple of years so we fans can find out as much as there is to know about our beloved characters.

For someone who is so smart, she is so dump. I don't know this, and I don't know that. Sure it work the first few times, but can't she learn? She kept saying I know I'm social inept and I'm trying to be better, and yet she fail to learn without people spell thing out for her. And why does she has to act like a B to people who she seem lesser intelligent. Being unsympathetic after a while is just irritating, irrational and is plain dump. Seeing her dialog with booth trying to explain social norm to her make you feel like you should hit your head against the wall, pass out so you don't have to suffer this bad series. And what's worse, after 10mins of irritating you with her social inept and refuse to understand other way of thinking, you are being slapped with at least 10mins of her failing to do the normal social thing, + another 10 of apologies for failing to do so, + 10mins of cheesy you get it next time. Just that she doesn't, and the viscous circle repeat. Every episode, she mocks at human being, then she glare or hate you because you laugh at her failure to act accordingly, and she feels no pity for you when she nuke you down with her harsh words. I found her character is such a child, and it irritating, and that child didn't learn, didn't grow up, and that make it hard to shallow. And lot of times, her character changes her personality like 180 degree so quick, that you feel not genuine. Like she dish on your behavior to the ground with her whiny monotone for a good 3mins+, then within 30s, she came and join you and act like it was really fun -.- The plot line is boring, and a few episodes are rip off of other show, without the good bit of it. All the side characters are annoying. They are whiny, not funny in any sense, doesn't have a real personality. Overall, the show is too contrive, the case is way way too boring, and some give you a déjà vu sense, and make you miss how good other show is. I put it on as background noise to see if I will hate it less than when I was watching it seriously, but I just end up found it too hard to stand to even watch it to fall asleep, I got fury up watching this show to be able to sleep. This show is not even worth it as background noise, I rather watch bad infomercial than this crap show, and no, I haven't read the book!i just genuine hate everything about this show!",

The Temperance Brennan character is, in the books, a down to earth recovering alcoholic and divorced mom of a college aged daughter. In 'Bones', she is an arrogant (rhymes with rich), who, in typical P C fashion, is not a mother. The emphasis on her assisting staff, complete with lurid details of who has had how many sexual exploits, is totally in contrast with the books.In total deference to the P C movement, she portrays the enemies of the U S as peace lovers (!). Some of the information isn't even correct, for example, having a character from Afghanistan as an active member of an Arab-American friendship group. Since when is an Afghan an Arab?! I'm sure if negative references were made to 'disadvantaged minorities', or women, or GLBT's, the show's producers/writers/directors would have to issue an apology. However, in typical far left fashion, all of the racial slurs go to the highest achieving minority group--Asians, as David Boreanaz' Agent Booth continually refers to Angela Montenegro as a 'squint'.Forget that stuff, and forget this show. After 'The Man in the SUV' episode, I thought I'd try a second episode to see if it got any better. It only got worse!

However, as time went on I found the show to become increasingly more gimmicky and unrelatable. Each new episode involved the team to investigate a murder that occurred in some new niche that was far too extreme, in my opinion. The people didn't feel like real people, they were all defined by a single trait (artisan businesses, mole people, Amish life).It all felt fake. Especially the \"lovable\" characters of our investigative team, or \"squints.\" Characters were given specific traits at what was convenient for the writers. Bones will be ultra- competitive, but it will be only noticeable in this episode. Or the death has something to do with something fairly obscure? Don't worry, this character has some background knowledge on this for no reason whatsoever. There just is no consistency in the characters. What made the whole thing worse was the inclusion of the interns in season 3 or 4(?) which only served to be a gimmick. It gives you the depressed one, the cocky one, the country one, the super smart one; extremes that just don't exist in the real world. And each one will have a dark back story for the purpose of drama that will just distance the characters farther and farther from the real world.After realizing how incredibly ridiculous each character was, I chose to stick it through and just watch this show for what it is; a crime show. Watch the squints as they solve crimes through complex and interesting cases. But then there was an obvious pattern. Unlike most crime shows which shows how a series of events lead to capturing the killer, Bones provides a much simpler solution. Booth and Brennan will investigate and investigate until they find a small detail in the bones (a nick or grooving) that they somehow hadn't noticed until the last ten minutes of the show that miraculously solves the case for them. The first fifty feel pointless because of this.Suffice it to say, I did not find this show enjoyable and can barely get through an episode anymore without finding it completely ridiculous.

I have nothing against marriage or babies it just that a crime show is not meant to be a family show. That is my mom opinion on the show, mine is I have to agree ! It was meant to be a forensic crime drama, with comic undertones. Not a family show where everyone gets married and has a baby, I mean not against the marriage and baby scene. But it needs to be toned down a lot , because it doesn't make good TV! There has to be a balance, somewhere. If one couple had a baby that is one thing but everyone. Instead of calling it Bones you might as well title it Babyboom the series.",

This terrible series fixates on the unreliability of a main character who can't remember key details, but this makes everything so unfocused that the show itself becomes forgettable. From the first grandstanding speech DeNero gives, which relies on clunky dialogue and cloying music (which he did terribly) all the way to his final one, it's completely lacking in anything approaching the necessary nuance or thought to make them feel remotely insightful. I think DeNero is done. This is time I can never get back. He has gone downhill the last 20 years to a has-been actor. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY BY NETFLIX.",

Watched it all in a day and Robert De Niro was rarely off screen and was simply brilliant. Truly one of the all time greatest. He was supported by a fantastic cast, a good script, well directed and extremely well filmed. This is Netflix at its best. I think it also raises warnings about how dangerous and influential the tech giants are as well as the politicians in their thrall.I have no hesitation in recommending this series which is something I rarely do. It proves that political series can be entertaining whilst dynamic and thoughtful.",

It's very topical as well, so you'd think there'd be a lot of material to work with. But that's where the series actually falls flat. The performances are just fine -- no one's going to win an award here, but DeNiro, Basset, and Plemons are all great actors, and no one turns in a bad performance per se. But the script itself is just woefully poor. At no time does this series really hook you as a thriller, make you feel a connection to this plot or these characters the way it should, or give you any sense of real political stakes. It just falls flat, and in the end feels like wasted potential -- and wasted time.",

We can never win it all, we can never have it all, and De Niro as the lead show cases that. Most we can accomplish when we enter the dance is that we leave it with our head held high by picking the road less travelled. And that's awfully hard and rare.Plemmons was great too.

I would however not go as far as calling it a classic, maybe because I've seen much better from De Niro. The pacing was good, episodes not too short, not too long. It does feel a bit rushed in the end. Maybe another 2 episodes would have been better. I dont forsee a 2nd season, though i think it would be great.

Instead, it became a character study in how many times can the camera focus on DeNiro's face?

As others have said, the confusion that de Niro's character suffers from is hammy, clumsy, overdone and overly-repeated... and it adds nothing to the plot. It's just an annoyance to watch.Plemmons is ok - not one of his better roles but his portrayal is fine. As is De Niro, just fine in his role but nothing special - sometimes even a little one dimensional (though the script may be to blame for that).Angela Bassett is woeful though, unbelievable as a sitting president. Again that may be down to the script - her character trying to push urgency with no real necessity behind it. \"I'm holding a press conference in 2 days so you need results by then\" is the same line used in 70's police series/ films, where the Captain shouts \"You've got 48 hours or it's your badge\".It was watchable, but I managed to follow the whole thing while working at home.Just a bit average really.",

Walking along corridors, walking to helicopters, walking to cars, walking into buildings, walking in the garden... (with his skinny old man legs).

A fine cast, a pleasantly short 6 episodes, so it doesn't drag too much (weirdly it manages to nonetheless at times), and a kernel of a fascinating plot. Sadly it fails on several levels; it feels like a 16 year old with a modicum of understanding of politics, power and technology decided to write a soap opera and occasionally had a helping hand from his more well informed uncle...I am sure this cost a fair bit of coin, so I hope it does well and encourages Netflix to greenlight similar endeavors as, despite its failings, it was largely gripping and had high production values.",

I'm impressed by location shots and I get it references current political sentiment in a benign sort of way. It also is an easy one to see telegraphed character moves.Some scenes are a bit altruistic, which don't seem to gel with the real worlds happening of the story, but overall it's one of they few new stories that you will keep going until you while the mystery of who done it, and the key characters multiple facades come undone.",

I was hoping there would be a very significant message sent by this series and I think it managed it fairly well. I sort of can relate it to the movie \"\"Dont Look Up\" in many ways but not with the comedic over tones.The message is one we may not want to think is possible but very well could be ... the enemy very well could be from within.I still didnt understand the birdfeeder angle .. anyone?Since I started to watch and now finished the rating has gone up from a 6 to a 6.4 but I have given it a 7.",

Everyday Netflix thinks we are dumber (and I probably am because I watched all of it). The worst part is they did not even try to take a clear moral or political stance. It is a safe, dry, clean, message about how politics and media and social media manipulates you, and how it can be weaponized. Something that has been known since Ancient Greece (no hyperbole).

The lack of technical depth and accuracy undermines the credibility of the storyline. A true-to-life cyber crime investigation should involve meticulous examination of digital footprints, evidence gathering, and advanced techniques to uncover the truth. By neglecting these essential aspects, the series fails to provide an authentic portrayal of cyber crime and investigation.
